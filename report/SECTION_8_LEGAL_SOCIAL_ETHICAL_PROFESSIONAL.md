# 8. Legal, Social, Ethical, and Professional Issues

## 8.1 Legal Compliance

This project incorporates compliance with relevant data protection legislation and software licensing requirements. The application processes user information including authentication credentials, payment details, personal preferences, and health-related skincare information, which necessitates adherence to data protection regulations. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes stringent requirements for personal data processing, including explicit user consent, data minimisation, and the right to erasure (European Union, 2016). In this project, user registration requires explicit consent before data collection, and the system maintains audit logs to demonstrate compliance with the lawful basis for processing. All user data is stored in MongoDB Atlas with encryption at rest and in transit, ensuring confidentiality and integrity as required by GDPR Article 32. The application implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data access to authorised personnel only, further complying with the principle of least privilege. Additionally, the application utilises third-party libraries with permissive open-source licenses: Express.js (MIT License), Vue.js (MIT License), Mongoose (Apache 2.0 License), Chart.js (MIT License), React Native (MIT License), Expo (MIT License), Nodemailer (MIT License), Multer (MIT License), bcryptjs (MIT License), and Agora SDK (proprietary with commercial license). All dependencies are documented in package.json manifests across backend, frontend, and mobile applications, and their respective licenses are compatible with the project's intended use, ensuring no licensing conflicts or legal violations arise from their integration. The payment processing integration with VNPay adheres to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements by delegating payment data handling to a certified third-party processor, ensuring the application does not directly store or transmit sensitive payment card information.

## 8.2 Ethical Data Handling

The application implements ethical principles in user data management through explicit consent mechanisms and secure storage practices. Prior to account creation, users are presented with a clear privacy notice explaining what data is collected, how it will be used, and who may access it, in accordance with ethical guidelines for informed consent (Stark and Hoey, 2021). The system does not collect unnecessary personal information; only data required for core functionality—such as username, email, and password hash—is retained. Sensitive health-related information provided during skin analysis consultations is processed through Google Generative AI (Gemini) with explicit user consent and is not permanently stored on application servers without explicit user request. Payment information is processed through VNPay, a PCI DSS-compliant third-party payment gateway, and is not stored directly on the application servers, reducing the scope of sensitive data exposure. User passwords are hashed using bcryptjs with a salt factor of 10, preventing plaintext storage and mitigating the risk of credential compromise (Provos and Mazières, 2019). The application implements role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorised personnel (administrators) can access sensitive operations such as product management and payment processing, limiting unauthorised data exposure. File uploads are handled securely through Multer middleware with file type validation and size restrictions, preventing malicious file uploads that could compromise system security. Furthermore, users retain the ability to request data deletion through a dedicated endpoint, supporting the ethical principle of user autonomy and control over personal information. The application implements input validation using express-validator to sanitise user inputs, preventing injection attacks and ensuring data integrity throughout the system.

## 8.3 Social Impact

The project addresses a specific social need within the beauty and skincare market by providing an accessible platform for product discovery and purchase. The application's multilingual support (Vietnamese and English) via Vue-i18n enhances accessibility for diverse user populations, reducing language barriers that might otherwise exclude non-English speakers from e-commerce participation (Graddol, 2010). The livestream shopping feature, powered by Agora SDK for real-time video communication, introduces an interactive dimension to e-commerce, enabling direct engagement between sellers and customers, which can foster community and trust in online transactions. The AI dermatology expert feature, utilising Google Generative AI, democratises access to skincare advice by providing personalised recommendations based on skin analysis, potentially improving health outcomes for users who lack access to professional dermatological consultation. The platform's multi-platform availability (web, iOS, and Android mobile applications) ensures broad accessibility across device types and user demographics. However, the platform's social impact must be considered critically. The focus on beauty and skincare products may inadvertently reinforce societal beauty standards, potentially affecting user self-perception and wellbeing (Tiggemann and Slater, 2013). To mitigate this risk, the application could incorporate educational content about diverse beauty standards and skincare inclusivity. Additionally, the platform's success depends on fair pricing and ethical sourcing practices by sellers, which the application does not currently enforce through automated verification mechanisms. The OCR capability via Tesseract.js could be leveraged to verify product ingredient labels and authenticity. Future iterations should incorporate seller verification and product authenticity checks to prevent the sale of counterfeit or harmful products, thereby protecting vulnerable consumer groups and promoting consumer safety.

## 8.4 Professional Standards

The development process adhered to established professional standards in software engineering, ensuring code quality, maintainability, and reliability. The codebase follows consistent naming conventions, modular architecture, and separation of concerns, with controllers handling HTTP requests, services encapsulating business logic, and models defining data structures. This layered architecture aligns with industry best practices for maintainability and testability (Martin, 2017). The project implements domain-driven design principles with eight distinct service modules (e-commerce, livestream, communication, marketing, analytics, finance, human resources, and authentication), enabling independent scaling and team collaboration without conflicts. Version control was maintained throughout development using Git with GitHub, with meaningful commit messages documenting changes and enabling traceability of modifications. The project implements comprehensive testing across unit, integration, and user acceptance testing phases, as detailed in Section 7, demonstrating a commitment to quality assurance and defect prevention. API documentation is generated automatically using Swagger/OpenAPI standards, providing clear specifications for endpoint behaviour, request/response schemas, and authentication requirements, facilitating collaboration and reducing integration errors. Error handling is implemented consistently across the application, with appropriate HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages, enabling clients to diagnose and respond to failures effectively. Security best practices are embedded throughout the codebase, including input validation via express-validator, parameterised queries to prevent SQL injection, rate limiting via express-rate-limit to mitigate denial-of-service attacks, and secure token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with configurable expiration periods. The application implements environment-based configuration management via dotenv, separating sensitive credentials from source code and preventing accidental exposure of API keys or database credentials. Performance monitoring utilities track API response times and database query performance, enabling identification and resolution of bottlenecks. The application is containerised using Docker for consistent deployment across development, testing, and production environments, following infrastructure-as-code principles. These professional practices collectively ensure that the application meets industry standards for reliability, security, maintainability, and scalability.
