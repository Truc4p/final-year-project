| Monthly Software Costs | 81% report USD 500–3,000 |
| UI Satisfaction | 78% frustrated/very frustrated with existing UIs |

#### Feature Interest & Demand (Likert Scale 1-5)
| Feature | Interest Rate | Avg. Rating | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Dermatological Consultation | 88% interested | M=4.2/5 | Strong demand; clinical credibility valued |
| AI Recommendations | 84% interested | M=4.3/5 | Highest-rated feature; core differentiator |
| Live Streaming Commerce | 76% interested | M=4.1/5 | Significant demand; real-time engagement critical |
| Unified Analytics Dashboard | 71% interested | M=3.9/5 | Moderate-to-strong demand; operational priority |
| Premium for Clinical Guidance | 71% willing to pay | M=3.9/5 | Customers value dermatological expertise |

*M = Mean (average); SD = Standard Deviation (measure of spread around the mean)

**Primary Frustrations (Table):**

| Category | Finding |
|---|---|
| Platform fragmentation | 35% report 3+ hours daily switching between systems (Shopify, Klaviyo, QuickBooks) |
| Limited personalization | 42% lack skin-type-based recommendations |
| No native streaming | 31% cite absence of live shopping capability |
| Lack of expert guidance | 56% report uncertainty about product suitability for their skin conditions |
| Trial-and-error costs | Many customers report wasted time and money on unsuitable products and routines due to lack of trusted, educational guidance |
| Migration propensity | 68% likely/very likely to migrate to an integrated alternative consolidating 5+ systems |

**Operational Requirements (Table):**

| Type | Item | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| Priority | Consolidated inventory/orders | 94% |
| Priority | Real-time analytics/reporting | 88% |
| Priority | Customer segmentation | 82% |
| Priority | Employee access control | 76% |
| Priority | Financial reporting | 71% |
| Barrier | Setup complexity/training | 58% |

#### Data Interpretation & Strategic Implications

**Platform Fragmentation Crisis:** The survey revealed that 73% of SME beauty businesses use 5+ platforms (M=6.8, SD=1.9), with 35% reporting 3+ hours daily switching between systems. This quantitative data strongly supports our project's focus on **unified platform consolidation** as a core value proposition. The high standard deviation (SD=1.9) indicates significant variation in platform adoption—some businesses use 4-5 systems, others 8+—suggesting a one-size-fits-all integration approach is essential.

**Cost Burden & ROI Opportunity:** 81% of respondents report monthly software costs of USD 500–3,000 (median USD 1,250/month = USD 15K annually). This creates a compelling financial case: consolidating 5+ platforms into one integrated solution could reduce costs by 40–50% (USD 6K–7.5K annually per business), directly addressing Marcus Johnson's frustration with USD 2,100 monthly expenses. This cost savings is a primary migration driver: 68% are likely/very likely to switch to an integrated alternative.

**UI/UX as Competitive Differentiator:** 78% of respondents were frustrated or very frustrated with existing solutions' user interfaces. This quantitative data strongly supports our project's focus on a **streamlined, modern UX/UI design** as a key competitive advantage. Combined with 58% citing setup complexity/training as a barrier to adoption, the platform must prioritize intuitive onboarding and minimal learning curve.

**AI & Personalization as Market Demand:** Feature interest data reveals strong demand for AI-driven capabilities:
- **AI Dermatological Consultation (88%, M=4.2/5)**: Highest-priority AI feature; 71% willing to pay premium validates the clinical-grade guidance feature as a key market differentiator.
- **AI Recommendations (84%, M=4.3/5)**: Highest-rated feature overall; addresses "Limited personalization" frustration (42% lack skin-type recommendations)
- **Live Streaming Commerce (76%, M=4.1/5)**: Significant demand; 31% cite absence of native streaming as frustration

- **AI Skin Education & Source Transparency:** Qualitative interviews indicate customers want to study their skin with an AI dermatology expert that explains conditions and routines in plain language, cites reliable dermatology textbooks and peer-reviewed sources, and helps them avoid wasting time and money on unsuitable products or routines.

This data validates the platform's three core pillars: **integration, personalization, and engagement**.

**Operational Requirements Alignment:** Business operators prioritized consolidated inventory/orders (94%), real-time analytics (88%), and customer segmentation (82%). The 52% citing data migration difficulty as a barrier indicates the need for robust migration tools and support during onboarding.
