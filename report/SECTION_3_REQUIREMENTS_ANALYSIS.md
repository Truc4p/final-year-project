# 3. Requirements Analysis

## 3.1 Research Methodology

This research employed a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews to capture comprehensive insights from both SME beauty business operators and end-use customers.

The survey was conducted using Google Forms as the primary data collection tool. The instrument consisted of 25 questions structured with branching logic to accommodate different respondent types. The survey was distributed through online communities targeting SME beauty businesses and skincare consumer groups.

Data collection yielded 127 responses over a 12-week period. Respondents included both business owners/managers and end-use customers, providing dual perspectives on platform needs and pain points.

The demographic profile of survey respondents showed 62% female and 38% male participants, with ages ranging from 25 to 55 years (mean age 38.4 years). For business respondents specifically, company sizes ranged from 1 to 50 employees (mean 8.3 employees), with annual revenues spanning USD 100K to USD 2M (median USD 450K).

To complement quantitative findings, 7 in-depth interviews were conducted, each lasting 30 minutes. Interview participants included two independent skincare retailers, two beauty business owners, and three end-use customers. This distribution ensured representation across both business operators and consumer perspectives.

Participant selection employed purposive sampling to capture variation across SME beauty business types, operational scales, and diverse customer demographics. This approach ensured the research encompassed different business models, technical capabilities, and user needs within the target market segment.

## 3.2 Market Analysis and User Needs

### 3.2.1 Business Respondent Findings

#### Business Feature Interest (Likert Scale 1-5)

Feature | Finding | Avg. Rating |
|---|---|---|
| Unified analytics dashboard | 86% prioritize | M=4.5/5 |
| Real-time analytics/reporting | 84% prioritize | M=4.4/5 |
| Setup complexity/training | 83% cite as barrier | M=4.4/5 |
| AI Recommendations | 89% interested | M=4.6/5 |
| Live Streaming Commerce | 89% interested | M=4.6/5 |

#### Data Interpretation & Strategic Implications

**Platform Fragmentation Crisis:** The survey revealed that 73% of SME beauty businesses use 5+ platforms, with 35% reporting 3+ hours daily switching between systems. This quantitative data strongly supports our project's focus on **unified platform consolidation** as a core value proposition. 

**Cost Burden & ROI Opportunity:** 81% of respondents report monthly software costs of USD 500–3,000. This creates a compelling financial case: consolidating 5+ platforms into one integrated solution could reduce costs by 40–50%. This cost savings is a primary migration driver: 68% are likely/very likely to switch to an integrated alternative.

**UI/UX as Competitive Differentiator:** 78% of respondents were frustrated or very frustrated with existing solutions' user interfaces. This quantitative data strongly supports our project's focus on a **streamlined, modern UX/UI design** as a key competitive advantage. Combined with 58% citing setup complexity/training as a barrier to adoption, the platform must prioritize intuitive onboarding and minimal learning curve.

### 3.2.2 Customer Respondent Findings

#### Customer Feature Interest (Likert Scale 1-5)

| Feature | Interest Rate | Avg. Rating |
|---|---|---|
| AI Dermatological Consultation | 88% interested | M=4.6/5 |
| Live Streaming Commerce | 86% interested | M=4.5/5 |
| AI Recommendations | 84% interested | M=4.4/5 |

#### Data Interpretation & Strategic Implications

**AI & Personalization as Market Demand:** Survey data reveals strong demand for AI-driven capabilities, with 88% of customers interested in AI dermatological consultation and 84% interested in AI recommendations. This addresses a critical gap, as 72% of respondents reported lacking skin-type-based recommendations in current solutions. Live streaming commerce also demonstrated significant demand at 86% interest, directly responding to the 60% who cited absence of native streaming as a frustration. Qualitative interviews further reinforced customers' desire to study their skin with an AI dermatology expert that explains conditions and routines in plain language, cites reliable dermatology textbooks and peer-reviewed sources, and helps them avoid wasting time and money on unsuitable products or routines.
