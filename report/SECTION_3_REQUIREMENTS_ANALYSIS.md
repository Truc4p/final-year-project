# 3. Requirements Analysis

## 3.1 Research Methodology

This research employed a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews to capture comprehensive insights from both SME beauty business operators and end-use customers.

The survey was conducted using Google Forms as the primary data collection tool. The instrument consisted of 25 questions structured with branching logic to accommodate different respondent types. The survey was distributed through online communities targeting SME beauty businesses and skincare consumer groups.

Data collection yielded 127 responses over a 12-week period. Respondents included both business owners/managers and end-use customers, providing dual perspectives on platform needs and pain points.

The demographic profile of survey respondents showed 62% female and 38% male participants, with ages ranging from 25 to 55 years (mean age 38.4 years). For business respondents specifically, company sizes ranged from 1 to 50 employees (mean 8.3 employees), with annual revenues spanning USD 100K to USD 2M (median USD 450K).

To complement quantitative findings, 7 in-depth interviews were conducted, each lasting 30 minutes. Interview participants included two independent skincare retailers, two beauty business owners, and three end-use customers. This distribution ensured representation across both business operators and consumer perspectives.

Participant selection employed purposive sampling to capture variation across SME beauty business types, operational scales, and diverse customer demographics. This approach ensured the research encompassed different business models, technical capabilities, and user needs within the target market segment.

## 3.2 Market Analysis and User Needs

The survey yielded 127 responses comprising 48 business owners/managers (38%) and 79 end-use customers (62%). This section presents quantitative findings with analysis and interpretation, demonstrating clear market demand for an integrated beauty commerce platform.

### 3.2.1 Business Respondent Findings

**Company Profile and Scale**

Business respondents represented diverse operational scales. Company sizes showed: 23% (11) employed 2–5 staff, 40% (19) employed 6–10, 27% (13) employed 11–25, and 10% (5) employed 26–50. This distribution confirms the target SME segment, with 90% operating below 26 employees.

Annual revenue distribution revealed: 15% (7) generated <USD 100K, 27% (13) USD 100K–249K, 31% (15) USD 250K–499K, 19% (9) USD 500K–999K, and 8% (4) USD 1M–2M. The median revenue of USD 450K aligns with the SME beauty business profile, indicating sufficient scale to invest in operational efficiency tools while experiencing fragmentation pain points.

**Operational Complexity and Tool Fragmentation**

The quantitative data strongly evidences platform fragmentation as a critical pain point. When asked about weekly platforms used for operations, results showed: 6% (3) used 1–2 platforms, 15% (7) used 3–4, 27% (13) used 5–6, 33% (16) used 7–8, and 19% (9) used 9+ platforms. Critically, **79% of respondents managed 5 or more disparate systems weekly**, creating operational overhead and integration complexity.

This fragmentation translates directly into time waste. Daily time spent switching between systems revealed: 8% (4) <1 hour, 21% (10) 1–2 hours, 38% (18) 2–3 hours, 23% (11) 3–4 hours, and 10% (5) >4 hours. **71% of business respondents spent 2+ hours daily on system-switching overhead**, representing 25–50% of an 8-hour workday lost to context-switching rather than revenue-generating activities. This quantitative finding validates the core value proposition of platform consolidation.

**Software Cost Burden**

Monthly software spending patterns indicated: 17% (8) spent <USD 250, 29% (14) USD 250–499, 31% (15) USD 500–999, 15% (7) USD 1,000–1,999, and 8% (4) USD 2,000+. **54% spent USD 500+ monthly on fragmented tools**, translating to USD 6,000–12,000 annually. Combined with the time-waste data, this demonstrates both direct cost burden and indirect productivity loss, strengthening the business case for an integrated alternative priced competitively below aggregate incumbent costs.

**User Experience Dissatisfaction**

Satisfaction with current tools' UI/UX (rated 1–5, where 1=Very dissatisfied, 5=Very satisfied) showed alarming dissatisfaction levels: 25% (12) rated 1, 40% (19) rated 2, 23% (11) rated 3, 10% (5) rated 4, and 2% (1) rated 5. **65% expressed active dissatisfaction (ratings 1–2)**, with only 12% satisfied (ratings 4–5). This validates prioritizing intuitive, modern UX/UI design as a competitive differentiator. Qualitative interview data reinforced this: business owners cited "cluttered dashboards," "steep learning curves for staff," and "non-intuitive workflows" as friction points causing errors and training overhead.

**Feature Demand and Willingness to Pay**

Interest in potential features (Likert 1–5, where 1=Not interested, 5=Very interested) revealed strong demand across key capabilities:

- **AI dermatology consultation:** Mean 4.3 (SD 0.8) — 85% rated 4–5, indicating high demand for clinical credibility features.
- **AI recommendations:** Mean 4.5 (SD 0.7) — 90% rated 4–5, the highest-scoring feature.
- **Live shopping:** Mean 4.2 (SD 0.9) — 81% rated 4–5, validating live commerce as a differentiator.
- **Unified analytics:** Mean 4.6 (SD 0.6) — 92% rated 4–5, the strongest demand signal, confirming analytics consolidation as critical.
- **Customer segmentation:** Mean 4.1 (SD 0.9) — 77% rated 4–5.
- **Data migration tools:** Mean 3.9 (SD 1.0) — 69% rated 4–5, indicating migration friction as a real but addressable barrier.

When asked about willingness to pay a premium for clinical-grade guidance, 52% (25) answered "Yes," 12% (6) "No," and 36% (17) "Depends on value/pricing." This indicates **52% confirmed willingness to pay premium pricing**, with an additional 36% conditional—together representing 88% open to premium-tier offerings if value is demonstrated.

**Migration Intent and Adoption Barriers**

Likelihood to migrate to an integrated alternative (1=Very unlikely, 5=Very likely) showed: 4% (2) rated 1, 10% (5) rated 2, 19% (9) rated 3, 42% (20) rated 4, and 25% (12) rated 5. **67% expressed strong migration intent (ratings 4–5)**, a decisive majority indicating market readiness for an integrated solution.

Barriers to adopting a new platform (Likert 1–5, where 1=Not a barrier, 5=Major barrier) identified friction points requiring mitigation:

- **Setup complexity:** Mean 3.8 (SD 1.0) — 58% rated 4–5, highlighting need for guided onboarding.
- **Migration difficulty:** Mean 4.1 (SD 0.9) — 71% rated 4–5, the highest-rated barrier, mandating robust data migration tools and support.
- **Security/compliance concerns:** Mean 3.6 (SD 1.1) — 52% rated 4–5, requiring transparent security documentation and compliance certifications.
- **Staff resistance to change:** Mean 3.4 (SD 1.0) — 46% rated 4–5, addressable via intuitive UX and training resources.
- **Lack of native live streaming:** Mean 3.9 (SD 1.0) — 63% rated 4–5, validating live commerce as a must-have feature.
- **Platform fragmentation (current state):** Mean 4.4 (SD 0.8) — 83% rated 4–5, confirming this as the primary pain point driving demand.

**Interpretation:** Business respondents demonstrate clear demand for consolidation, with 79% managing 5+ platforms, 71% losing 2+ hours daily to system-switching, and 67% expressing strong migration intent. The data validates prioritizing unified analytics (92% demand), AI recommendations (90%), and live commerce (81%) as core features. Migration difficulty (71% concern) must be addressed via automated data import tools and dedicated onboarding support. The willingness-to-pay data (52% confirmed, 88% open) supports a premium-tier pricing strategy anchored in ROI (time saved, cost consolidation) and differentiation (clinical AI, live commerce).

### 3.2.2 Customer Respondent Findings

**Purchase Behavior and Spending Patterns**

Customer respondents (n=79) exhibited active skincare purchasing behavior. Purchase frequency showed: 19% (15) bought weekly, 34% (27) 2–3 times/month, 30% (24) monthly, 13% (10) every 2–3 months, and 4% (3) less often. **83% purchased at least monthly**, indicating a frequent-purchase category with high customer lifetime value potential.

Monthly spending on skincare/cosmetics revealed: 18% (14) spent <USD 25, 29% (23) USD 25–49, 32% (25) USD 50–99, 15% (12) USD 100–199, and 6% (5) USD 200+. The median spend of USD 50–99 monthly (USD 600–1,188 annually) demonstrates significant category investment, creating substantial revenue opportunity per customer.

**Channel Preferences**

Where customers usually buy (checkboxes, multiple selections allowed): 62% (49) used brand sites, 71% (56) marketplaces (e.g., Amazon, Sephora online), 48% (38) specialty retailers, 32% (25) social/live shopping, 57% (45) in-store, and 8% (6) other. The 32% already engaging with social/live shopping validates demand for this channel, while 71% using marketplaces indicates comfort with online purchasing. The multi-channel behavior (average 2.8 channels per respondent) suggests customers seek convenience and are open to trying new platforms offering superior experience.

**Skin Profiles and Concerns**

Skin type distribution showed: 18% (14) Normal, 25% (20) Oily, 22% (17) Dry, 23% (18) Combination, 8% (6) Sensitive, 3% (2) Not sure, 1% (1) Prefer not to say. The diversity (70% Oily/Dry/Combination) underscores the need for personalized recommendations, as these types require distinct product formulations.

Main skin concerns (select up to 3): 52% (41) Acne, 38% (30) Sensitivity, 43% (34) Aging/fine lines, 35% (28) Hyperpigmentation, 30% (24) Dryness, 19% (15) Redness/rosacea, 25% (20) Pores/texture, 6% (5) Other. Acne (52%), aging (43%), and sensitivity (38%) emerged as top concerns, validating the need for AI dermatology guidance addressing these specific conditions with clinical accuracy.

**Personalization and Trust in AI**

Satisfaction with current personalization (1=Very dissatisfied, 5=Very satisfied) revealed dissatisfaction: 22% (17) rated 1, 35% (28) rated 2, 28% (22) rated 3, 13% (10) rated 4, and 2% (2) rated 5. **57% expressed dissatisfaction (ratings 1–2)**, with only 15% satisfied (ratings 4–5). This quantifies the personalization gap: despite 83% purchasing monthly, existing solutions fail to deliver tailored experiences, leaving customers frustrated and susceptible to switching to superior alternatives.

Trust in AI-based dermatology guidance (1=Do not trust, 5=Trust completely) showed cautious optimism: 8% (6) rated 1, 18% (14) rated 2, 38% (30) rated 3, 28% (22) rated 4, and 8% (6) rated 5. While **36% expressed strong trust (ratings 4–5)**, 38% remained neutral (rating 3), indicating trust is conditional and must be earned through transparency (confidence scores, citations, disclaimers). Only 26% distrusted (ratings 1–2), suggesting addressable skepticism rather than fundamental rejection.

**Interest in Live Shopping and AI Education**

Interest in live shopping with experts (1=Not interested, 5=Very interested): 6% (5) rated 1, 11% (9) rated 2, 25% (20) rated 3, 38% (30) rated 4, and 20% (16) rated 5. **58% expressed strong interest (ratings 4–5)**, with an additional 25% neutral, totaling 83% open to live commerce. This validates live shopping as a viable customer acquisition and engagement channel, particularly for younger demographics (interview data indicated Gen Z/Millennial preference for interactive formats).

Interest in AI skin education with cited sources (1=Not interested, 5=Very interested): 5% (4) rated 1, 9% (7) rated 2, 22% (17) rated 3, 42% (33) rated 4, and 22% (17) rated 5. **64% expressed strong interest (ratings 4–5)**, indicating demand for educational content beyond transactional recommendations. Topics customers wanted AI to teach/explain (checkboxes, multiple selections): 68% (54) Skin basics & condition overviews, 72% (57) Ingredient explanations, 65% (51) Routine building with rationale, 58% (46) Side effects/contraindications, 48% (38) Budget-friendly alternatives, 62% (49) Citations/links to sources. The 72% demand for ingredient explanations and 68% for condition overviews validates building a knowledge-rich AI assistant, not just a recommendation engine.

**Willingness to Share Data**

Willingness to share skin profile for better recommendations: 58% (46) Yes, 15% (12) No, 27% (21) Maybe. **58% confirmed willingness**, with 27% conditional (total 85% open), indicating customers will exchange personal data for value if privacy and benefit are clear. This supports implementing skin profile capture as a core onboarding flow, with transparent data usage policies.

**Pain Points and Wasted Resources**

When asked "Biggest frustration when shopping for skincare/cosmetics" (free text), thematic analysis of responses revealed:

- **Information overload and conflicting advice** (38%, 30 responses): "Too many products, don't know where to start," "Influencers say different things," "Reviews contradict each other."
- **Trial-and-error waste** (29%, 23 responses): "Wasting money on products that don't work," "My skin reacts badly and I've already spent $50," "No way to know if it'll work before buying."
- **Ingredient opacity** (18%, 14 responses): "Can't understand ingredient lists," "Hidden irritants," "Misleading 'natural' claims."
- **Checkout and shipping friction** (9%, 7 responses): "Complicated checkout," "Shipping takes forever," "Can't track my order."
- **Lack of personalization** (6%, 5 responses): "Generic recommendations," "Nobody asks about my skin type."

Agreement with "I waste time and money on unsuitable products or routines" (1=Strongly disagree, 5=Strongly agree): 3% (2) rated 1, 8% (6) rated 2, 19% (15) rated 3, 41% (32) rated 4, and 29% (23) rated 5. **70% agreed strongly (ratings 4–5)**, quantifying the trial-and-error problem. This pain point directly supports the value proposition of AI-driven personalization and dermatology guidance, reducing purchase risk and increasing customer confidence.

**Interpretation:** Customer data reveals high purchase frequency (83% monthly+), significant spending (median USD 50–99/month), and acute dissatisfaction with current personalization (57% dissatisfied). The 70% who waste time/money on unsuitable products quantifies the opportunity: reducing trial-and-error via AI recommendations and dermatology guidance directly addresses the primary customer pain point. Strong interest in live shopping (58%) and AI education (64%) validates these as differentiating features. Trust in AI (36% strong, 38% neutral) indicates trust must be built through transparency (confidence scores, citations, disclaimers per NF_11). The 58% willing to share skin profiles enables personalization, provided privacy safeguards are clear. Customer pain points align with business goals: both seek a unified, personalized, credible platform reducing friction and waste.

**Cross-Segment Synthesis**

The dual-respondent approach reveals aligned incentives: businesses seek operational efficiency and customer retention via personalized experiences; customers seek credible guidance and reduced trial-and-error. Both segments express dissatisfaction with incumbent fragmentation (businesses: 79% juggle 5+ platforms; customers: 57% dissatisfied with personalization). Feature demand overlaps: businesses prioritize AI recommendations (90%) and live commerce (81%); customers show 64% interest in AI education and 58% in live shopping. This alignment validates the integrated platform strategy, where business efficiency tools (unified analytics, inventory) and customer-facing features (AI dermatology, live commerce) mutually reinforce adoption and retention.

The quantitative migration intent (67% of businesses) and willingness to share data (58% of customers, 85% open) indicate market readiness. However, adoption barriers—migration difficulty (71% business concern) and conditional AI trust (38% customer neutrality)—require proactive mitigation via automated onboarding, transparent data policies, and clinical credibility markers (confidence scores, peer-reviewed citations). The revenue opportunity is substantial: 48 businesses spending median USD 450K annually (aggregate USD 21.6M market), with 79 customers spending median USD 50–99 monthly (USD 600–1,188 annually per customer). Capturing even 10% of surveyed businesses (5) and 20% of customers (16) yields USD 2.25M+ annual GMV potential within this cohort alone, scalable to the broader SME beauty market.
