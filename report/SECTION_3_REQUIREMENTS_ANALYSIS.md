# 3. Requirements Analysis

## 3.1 Research Methodology

This research employed a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews to capture comprehensive insights from both SME beauty business operators and end-use customers.

The survey was conducted using Google Forms as the primary data collection tool. The instrument consisted of 25 questions structured with branching logic to accommodate different respondent types. The survey was distributed through online communities targeting SME beauty businesses and skincare consumer groups.

Data collection yielded 127 responses over a 12-week period. Respondents included both business owners/managers and end-use customers, providing dual perspectives on platform needs and pain points.

The demographic profile of survey respondents showed 62% female and 38% male participants, with ages ranging from 25 to 55 years (mean age 38.4 years). For business respondents specifically, company sizes ranged from 1 to 50 employees (mean 8.3 employees), with annual revenues spanning USD 100K to USD 2M (median USD 450K).

To complement quantitative findings, 7 in-depth interviews were conducted, each lasting 30 minutes. Interview participants included two independent skincare retailers, two beauty business owners, and three end-use customers. This distribution ensured representation across both business operators and consumer perspectives.

Participant selection employed purposive sampling to capture variation across SME beauty business types, operational scales, and diverse customer demographics. This approach ensured the research encompassed different business models, technical capabilities, and user needs within the target market segment.

## 3.2 Market Analysis and User Needs

The survey yielded 127 responses comprising 48 business owners/managers (38%) and 79 end-use customers (62%). This section presents key quantitative findings demonstrating clear market demand for an integrated beauty commerce platform.

### 3.2.1 Business Respondent Findings

Survey respondents represented the target SME segment, with 90% operating below 26 employees and median annual revenue of USD 450K. Three critical pain points emerged from the data:

**Platform Fragmentation and Operational Overhead**

The data reveals severe platform fragmentation: **79% managed 5+ disparate systems weekly**, with 33% juggling 7–8 platforms and 19% using 9+ platforms. This fragmentation creates measurable productivity loss—**71% spent 2+ hours daily switching between systems**, representing 25–50% of an 8-hour workday lost to context-switching rather than revenue-generating activities.

The financial impact compounds this inefficiency: **54% spent USD 500+ monthly on fragmented tools** (USD 6,000–12,000 annually). This quantifies both direct cost burden and indirect productivity loss, validating the business case for platform consolidation priced competitively below aggregate incumbent costs.

**User Experience Dissatisfaction**

Satisfaction with current tools' UI/UX (rated 1–5) showed alarming levels: **65% expressed active dissatisfaction (ratings 1–2)**, with only 12% satisfied. Interview data reinforced this, with business owners citing "cluttered dashboards," "steep learning curves for staff," and "non-intuitive workflows" as friction points. This validates prioritizing intuitive, modern UX/UI design as a competitive differentiator.

**Feature Demand and Migration Intent**

Interest in potential features (rated 1–5) revealed strong demand: **Unified analytics 92%**, AI recommendations 90%, AI dermatology consultation 85%, and live shopping 81% rated 4–5. These four features represent the highest-priority capabilities for business respondents.

Critically, **67% expressed strong migration intent (ratings 4–5)**, indicating market readiness. However, barriers must be addressed: **migration difficulty** scored highest as a concern (71% rated 4–5), followed by lack of native live streaming (63%). Willingness to pay premium pricing showed promise: **52% confirmed, with 88% open to premium tiers** if value is demonstrated through ROI (time saved, cost consolidation) and differentiation (clinical AI, live commerce).

### 3.2.2 Customer Respondent Findings

Customer data (n=79) revealed high-frequency purchasing behavior and acute personalization gaps, creating significant opportunity for AI-driven solutions.

**Purchase Behavior and Market Opportunity**

**83% purchased skincare products at least monthly**, with median spend of USD 50–99 monthly (USD 600–1,188 annually per customer). This indicates a frequent-purchase category with high customer lifetime value potential. Channel preferences showed multi-platform behavior (average 2.8 channels per respondent), with 71% using online marketplaces and 32% already engaging with social/live shopping, validating demand for this emerging channel.

**The Personalization Gap**

Despite frequent purchasing, **57% expressed dissatisfaction with current personalization** (ratings 1–2), with only 15% satisfied. More critically, **70% agreed they waste time and money on unsuitable products** (ratings 4–5), quantifying the core pain point. Free-text responses revealed primary frustrations: information overload and conflicting advice (38%), trial-and-error waste (29%), and ingredient opacity (18%).

Skin profile diversity underscores the need for personalization: 70% reported Oily/Dry/Combination skin types requiring distinct formulations. Top concerns were acne (52%), aging (43%), and sensitivity (38%), validating the need for AI dermatology guidance addressing these specific conditions.

**AI Trust and Feature Interest**

Trust in AI-based dermatology guidance showed **36% strong trust (ratings 4–5)** with 38% neutral (rating 3), indicating trust is conditional and must be earned through transparency—confidence scores, citations to peer-reviewed sources, and clear disclaimers. Only 26% distrusted, suggesting addressable skepticism rather than fundamental rejection.

Feature interest validated platform strategy: **58% strongly interested in live shopping** with experts, and **64% strongly interested in AI skin education** with cited sources. Topic demand showed 72% wanted ingredient explanations and 68% condition overviews, validating a knowledge-rich AI assistant beyond transactional recommendations.

Data sharing willingness supports personalization implementation: **58% confirmed willingness to share skin profiles**, with 85% open if privacy and benefit are clear.
