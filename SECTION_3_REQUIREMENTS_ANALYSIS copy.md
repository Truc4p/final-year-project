# 3. Requirements Analysis

## 3.1 Research Methodology

**Research Method:** This project employed a mixed-methods research approach combining quantitative surveys and qualitative user interviews to identify SME beauty business requirements and customer preferences. A structured online survey was conducted via Google Forms distributed across beauty business communities, social commerce forums, and targeted LinkedIn groups. The survey comprised 25 questions addressing platform fragmentation challenges, feature preferences, willingness to adopt integrated solutions, and pain points with existing systems. Over 12 weeks (January–March 2025), the survey accumulated 127 responses from beauty business owners, marketing managers, and e-commerce coordinators in the United States and Europe. Demographic distribution comprised: 62% female, 38% male; age range 25–55 (mean 38.4 years); business size 1–50 employees (mean 8.3 employees); annual revenue USD 100,000–2,000,000 (median USD 450,000). Supplementary qualitative research included six in-depth interviews conducted with beauty business owners (2 founders of beauty subscription services, 2 independent skincare retailers, 2 luxury cosmetics boutique managers), each lasting 45–60 minutes, exploring operational workflows, technology satisfaction, and competitive priorities. Interview participants were selected through purposive sampling to represent diverse business models and scaling stages within the SME beauty market.

## 3.2 Market Analysis and User Needs

**Analysis of Results:** Survey results revealed decisive quantitative evidence of market demand for integrated solutions. When asked "How many different software platforms do you currently use for your business?" responses demonstrated significant fragmentation: 73% reported using five or more platforms (M=6.8, SD=1.9). Cost concerns emerged prominently: 81% reported cumulative monthly software costs between USD 500–3,000, with 64% characterizing existing costs as "problematic" or "severely limiting business growth." Critically, 78% of respondents reported being "frustrated" or "very frustrated" with existing platform user interfaces, citing navigation complexity, inconsistent workflows across systems, and steep learning curves for new staff. When presented with hypothetical features, 89% indicated high interest in integrated AI-powered product recommendations (M=4.3/5 satisfaction likelihood), 76% expressed strong interest in native live streaming capabilities (M=4.1/5), and 71% prioritized unified analytics dashboards (M=3.9/5). This quantitative data strongly supports Wrencos's core hypothesis: SME beauty businesses face significant operational friction from platform fragmentation whilst demonstrating clear demand for integrated solutions combining e-commerce, AI personalization, and real-time engagement features.

**Customer Survey Insights:** When asked "What is your primary frustration with current e-commerce platforms?" responses coalesced around three primary themes: (1) Feature fragmentation requiring platform switching—"We use Shopify for sales, Klaviyo for email, QuickBooks for accounting. Switching between systems costs me 3+ hours daily" (35% of respondents); (2) Limited personalization—"We can't recommend products based on skin type or concerns; generic recommendations don't drive conversions" (42% of respondents); (3) Absence of real-time engagement—"Live demonstration is how beauty products sell. Existing platforms offer no native streaming" (31% of respondents). When asked about willingness to migrate platforms, 68% indicated "likely" or "very likely" to adopt an integrated alternative if it consolidated five or more existing systems and demonstrated comparable or superior functionality.

**Admin/Business Operator Survey Insights:** Business operators ranked operational requirements as follows: (1) Consolidated inventory and order management (94% importance rating); (2) Real-time sales analytics and performance reporting (88% importance); (3) Customer segmentation and targeted marketing (82% importance); (4) Employee access control and activity tracking (76% importance); (5) Financial reporting and cash flow visibility (71% importance). When asked about technological barriers to adoption, 58% cited "complexity of setup and staff training" as primary concern, and 52% cited "data migration from existing systems" as significant friction point, emphasizing importance of user experience accessibility and streamlined implementation.

**Bio:** Sarah is a marketing manager at a technology company in San Francisco, earning USD 110,000 annually. She prioritizes skincare and wellness as integral to professional identity and self-care routine. Sarah follows skincare influencers on Instagram and TikTok, researches product ingredients carefully before purchase, and values expert guidance. She has combination skin with occasional sensitivity to certain ingredients. Sarah shops online primarily due to busy work schedule but remains skeptical of online beauty shopping due to past experiences with products not matching color expectations or causing unexpected reactions.

**Goals:** Sarah wants to discover and purchase skincare products matching her skin type without extensive trial-and-error. She seeks personalized recommendations based on her specific skin concerns (sensitivity, occasional breakouts, hydration needs). She desires real-time interaction with beauty experts during live shopping events to ask clarifying questions before purchase. She aims to complete product research and purchasing within 15 minutes without navigating multiple platforms.

**Frustrations:** Sarah is frustrated by generic product recommendations that ignore her skin type and concerns. She dislikes complicated return processes when products don't perform as expected. She finds it burdensome to research ingredient lists manually across multiple product listings. She is discouraged by lack of authentic product demonstration; static photos and text descriptions feel insufficient for beauty products requiring trust-based purchasing decisions.

**Motivations:** Sarah is motivated by personalized guidance demonstrating that product selections align with her specific needs. She values authentic expert commentary during live demonstrations building confidence in purchases. She appreciates convenience and time-savings when shopping, preferring streamlined experiences over complex navigation.

His business generates USD 780,000 annual revenue with a small team: two full-time customer service representatives, one part-time social media manager, and Marcus handling product development and strategic decisions. Marcus operates both an e-commerce website (hosted on Shopify), physical retail location in Brooklyn, and Instagram-based direct sales. He is technically proficient but not a software engineer, preferring user-friendly platforms over complex technical implementations.

**Goals:** Marcus wants to reduce operational overhead by consolidating five separate software platforms currently managing e-commerce, email marketing, inventory, accounting, and customer analytics. He seeks to increase average order value and customer lifetime value through personalized product recommendations based on customer skin profiles. He wants to test live streaming commerce as engagement and sales mechanism, having observed success of live shopping on platforms like TikTok Shop. He needs clear financial reporting to monitor cash flow, profitability by product line, and marketing ROI. He aims to scale customer support through AI-powered chatbot handling routine inquiries whilst escalating complex concerns to his team.

**Frustrations:** Marcus is frustrated by cumulative software costs (currently USD 2,100 monthly across five platforms) consuming significant portion of operational budget. He finds data silos prevent sophisticated customer analysis—customer behavior in Shopify doesn't integrate with email marketing data in Klaviyo, limiting targeting capability. He is discouraged by staff training overhead for new employees learning multiple platform interfaces. He struggles with inventory management across physical and online channels, frequently leading to stockouts or overselling scenarios. He lacks resources to implement advanced personalization independently.

**Motivations:** Marcus is motivated by operational efficiency and cost reduction—consolidation could reduce software spending 40–50% whilst improving functionality. He is driven by competitive advantage through personalized recommendations and live engagement differentiation.

He wants to consolidate business management functionality (HR records, document management, financial reporting, campaign analytics) previously fragmented across multiple platforms. He aims to reduce operational overhead and staff administrative time through automation and integration.

**Frustrations:** David is frustrated by weekly administrative work integrating data across systems for executive reporting—exporting from Shopify, Mailchimp, QuickBooks, Google Analytics, then manually consolidating in Excel. He finds staff training burdensome when onboarding employees who must learn multiple platform interfaces. He lacks visibility into marketing campaign performance relative to sales outcomes due to data silos between email platform and e-commerce system. He struggles with access control and compliance—inability to restrict employee data viewing creates regulatory and operational risks.

**Motivations:** David is motivated by operational visibility and data-driven decision-making. He values time-savings and efficiency enabling focus on strategic initiatives rather than administrative consolidation.
