### Admin Dashboard - Web (1.5 minutes)

"Now let me switch to an administrator account to show the management capabilities.

In the e-commerce management section, Here's the product management interface where I can add new products, edit existing ones, or remove items. 

The category management allows organizing products into logical groups. 

In the orders section, I can view all customer orders, search orders, update their status

User management shows all registered customers

The analytics dashboard shows sales trends, popular products, Low Stock Alert. These visualizations help make data-driven business decisions.

Now let's explore the specialized business management modules:

**Finance Management** - Finance dashboard shows the financial overview with total revenue, expenses, net income, and cash balance at a glance. 

Let me click on 'Invoices' to see accounts receivable. I can create a new invoice by selecting a customer, adding line items with products or services, setting payment terms, and sending it. Each invoice tracks its status - draft, sent, paid, or overdue.

Now switching to 'Bills' for accounts payable. I'll create a bill from a vendor, enter the amount and due date. The system tracks which bills need approval, which are posted, and manages payments.

Let me show you the Financial Reports section. I'll select 'Income Statement' and choose the period - let's say 'Current Quarter'. The system generates a detailed profit and loss statement showing all revenue streams, expense categories broken down by type, and the net income. I can export this as a PDF  or as an Excel file for further analysis.

Let me switch to the 'Balance Sheet' report. This shows total assets, liabilities and equity. And here's the 'Cash Flow Statement' tracking operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Here is Cash Flow Dashboard to show how cash moves through the business.

**HR Management** - Moving to the HR section, I see an overview of our workforce - total employees, department breakdown, and recent activities.

Let me Add New Employee'. I'll enter their details:... Then I set their department - let's choose 'Marketing' - position as 'Marketing Specialist', employment type 'Full-time', and their salary information with pay frequency, upload documents.

I'll set their start date, assign a manager from the dropdown, and configure their leave balance - 20 vacation days, 10 sick days, and 5 personal days. I can also check their benefits like health insurance and retirement plan.

Now let view an existing employee. Click on their profile and I can see all their information at a glance - contact details, employment info, salary, leave balances, and any uploaded documents like contracts or certifications.

The system also provides department statistics showing employee count per department, average salaries, and payroll summaries. 

**Marketing Management** - Let's open the Email Marketing section. First, I see the Subscribers page showing all our newsletter subscribers with their subscription date and preferences.

Now I'll create a new email campaign. Click 'Create Campaign', enter a campaign name like 'Spring Sale Announcement', write an engaging subject line, and select the campaign type - let's choose 'Promotion'.

For content, I can either write HTML directly or click 'Use Template' to select from our template library. Let me choose the 'Promotion' template - it has a professional design with placeholders for headline, discount amount, and call-to-action button.

Now for targeting, I can send to 'All Subscribers' or create a segment. Let me segment by selecting subscribers who opted in for 'Promotions' and subscribed within the last 6 months. The system shows me exactly how many recipients match these criteria.

Before sending, I'll click 'Preview & Send' to see exactly how the email will look in an inbox. Everything looks good! I can either send it immediately or schedule it for tomorrow morning at 9 AM. Let me schedule it.

After campaigns are sent, I can view the Analytics dashboard showing campaign performance - open rates, click-through rates, and subscriber growth over time displayed in beautiful charts.

**Livestream Management** - Finally, let me demonstrate the livestream capabilities. I'll start a new livestream by entering a title 'Beauty Tips & Product Demo' and description, then hit 'Go Live'.

The stream interface shows my video feed, and I can see the viewer count increasing in real-time - currently 15 viewers watching.

To feature products, I'll click the 'Pin Product' button and select a moisturizer from the dropdown. Immediately, this product card appears on all viewers' screens with the image, name, and price. They can click to add it to their cart without leaving the stream.

I can see the chat messages coming in from viewers. Let me respond to this question about ingredients - my message appears with an admin badge so viewers know it's from the host.

The engagement metrics are updating live - we now have 23 viewers, and 8 people have liked the stream. I can also unpin products or change the display order as the stream progresses.

When I'm done, I'll click 'End Stream', and the system saves the recording automatically, making it available in the 'Past Streams' section for customers who missed it."

"Now let's look at the mobile experience. I'm opening the customer app on my phone.

The shopping experience is optimized for mobile - smooth scrolling through products, easy filtering, and a streamlined checkout process.

The mobile AI dermatology consultation is even more powerful than the web version. Customers can:
