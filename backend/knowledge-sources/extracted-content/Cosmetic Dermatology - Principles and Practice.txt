Dedication

This book is dedicated to the three men in my life:

Roger Alexander Baumann
Thank you for encouraging me and being there to help
me with all the technology and business aspects of my
life. Your never- ending support has kept me sane over
the years. Most of all, my thanks for dragging me out of
the mud when times were tough like a good cutting
horse does! You are an ideal husband, father, and friend.
Here’s to another 20 years together!

Robert Edward Baumann
I am so proud of what a good person you are growing up
to be. You are kind, have a great sense of humor, and
have a love for others that is truly refreshing. You have
many talents, one of which is making me feel very special
and proud to have you as a son.
Keep up the good work!

Maximilian Carl Baumann
When this book comes out, you will be 7 years old. It is
hard to believe that you are growing up so fast; however,
you will always be my baby. I am very proud of what a
great student and person you are. I am so happy to have
someone in the family who is so much like me and loves
to read as much as I do.
Never stop snuggling!

Roger, Robert and Max, 
You all brighten my life, remind me of what is important,
and make it all worthwhile.
Thank you for loving me!

Cosmetic dermatology is a rapidly grow-
ing field that can attribute its popularity
to aging baby boomers. Although many
dermatologists  perform  cosmetic  proce-
dures  and  millions  of  dollars  are  spent
each year on cosmetic products, there is a
paucity of published research in this field.
I  was  stimulated  to  write  this  text
because  I  have  found  it  challenging  to
conduct thorough research in preparation
for my lectures and articles on cosmetic
science as there exists no undisputed ref-
erence  at  the  moment.  Of  the  research
performed  by  cosmetic  scientists,  much
of  it,  unfortunately,  is  proprietary  infor-
mation owned by corporations and is not
published  or  shared  in  any  way  for  the
immediate  benefit  of  the  medical  com-
munity and other cosmetic professionals.
This results in each company or cosmetic
scientist having to “reinvent the wheel.”
My  goal,  with  this  book,  is  to  create  a
link, featuring a better streaming flow of
information,  between  the  fields  of  der-
matology and cosmetic science. This text
is  designed  to  help  cosmetic  dermatolo-
gists  understand  the  available  informa-
tion  on  various  cosmetic  products  and
procedures. It should also help cosmetic
chemists  to  understand  the  issues  that
cosmetic  dermatologists  deal  with  on  a
frequent  basis.  In  addition,  this  text
should fill the gap in knowledge among
professionals  such  as  aestheticians  who
need to know what to apply to patients’
or  clients’  skin  and  about  the  products
that  people  purchase  over-the-counter
and apply to their skin. This text should
help these professionals answer the ques-
tions that their clients/patients ask about
skin  care  products  and  their  scientific
validity. It is my hope that this text will
encourage  cosmetic  dermatologists,  cos-
metic scientists and aestheticians to insist
upon well researched cosmetic products

and  procedures.  By  working  together  in
this way we can preserve the integrity of
an  exciting  and  rapidly  developing  field
of study.

Research in the field of cosmetic der-
matology  should  be  encouraged  for
many  reasons.  Obviously,  it  is  vital  to
maintain the hard earned integrity of the
field of dermatology. In addition, the dis-
coveries  made  though  cosmetic  derma-
tology  research  will  likely  benefit  other
fields  of  dermatology.  For  example,
research  into  the  anti-aging  effects  of
antioxidants  may  lead  to  enhanced
knowledge  of  chemopreventive  tech-
niques to be used to prevent skin cancer.
Advances  in  acne  therapy,  vitiligo  and
other disorders of pigmentation are also
possible. In fact, it is interesting to note
that  the  development  of  Vaniqa™,  a
cream  designed  to  slow  hair  growth  in
women  with  facial  hair,  has  led  to  the
availability  of  an  intravenous  treatment
for  African  Sleeping  Sickness,  a  major
cause  of  death  in  Africa.  Without  the
financial  incentive  to  develop  Vaniqa,
which  is  used  for  purely  aesthetic  pur-
poses, this life-saving drug would not be
available. For many reasons, all pharma-
ceutical,  medical  device,  and  cosmetic
companies  should  be  encouraged  to
research their products.

Although there is much research per-
formed  by  cosmetic  companies  on  the
effects of cosmetics on the skin, much of
this  data  is  proprietary  and  is  not  pub-
lished nor shared with the rest of the sci-
entific community. The reasons for this
are numerous, but competition between
companies and the desire to be the first
to come out with a new “miracle prod-
uct”  are  prominent  among 
them.
However,  the  issue  is  even  more  com-
plex.  The  FDA  has  different  definitions
for drugs and cosmetics. Cosmetic prod-

ucts do not have to be researched in any
standard  way  because  FDA  approval  is
not required. Instead, cosmetic products
are voluntarily registered by the compa-
nies that develop them. However, drugs
must  undergo  years  of  expensive  trials
establishing  both  safety  and  efficacy
before  receiving  FDA  approval  (see 
Ch 28). This disparity means that a com-
pany  is  more  reluctant  to  publish  data
that  could  cause  their  product  to  be
labeled as a drug.

The dearth of published data on cos-
metic  products  has  forced  physicians,
aestheticians,  and  lay  people  to  rely  on
sales people and marketing departments
to  obtain  information  about  cosmetic
formulations. This has led to much mis-
information  that  has  diminished  the
credibility of cosmetic products and the
cosmetic  field  in  general.  Because  an
ever-increasing  number  of  dermatolo-
gists and other physicians are practicing
“cosmetic dermatology,” it is imperative
that the cosmetic dermatologist practice
evidence-based medicine in order to dis-
tinguish  efficacious  treatments  from
mere  marketing  hype.  This  text  sifts
through  the  knowledge  of  the  effects
cosmetic  products  and  procedures  have
on  the  skin  and  its  appearance.  The
amount  of  research  that  should  still  be
performed  is  daunting;  however,  the
field is young and the rewards are great.
I  encourage  everyone  to  join  me  in  the
exciting  endeavor  to  find  scientifically
proven  methods  of 
improving  the
appearance of the skin.

The  first  edition  of  this  book  was
printed in 4 languages and was the best-
selling  textbook  on  cosmetic  dermatol-
ogy worldwide (or so I have been told).
There are many people to thank for this
and  the  many  wonderful  things  that
have occurred in the last 6 years. First I
would like to thank Dr. Stephen Mandy
who  took  me  in  as  a  newly  graduated
resident in 1997, and let me and my hus-
band live with him for two weeks while
he taught me about the newly emerging
field of cosmetic dermatology. (I learned
to inject collagen on his secretary!) That
was  the  beginning  of  what  has  now
been an 11-year friendship. Dr. Francisco
Kerdel negotiated my first job and office
space and he and Dr. William Eaglstein
mentor  me  to  this  day.  They  were
thanked  in  the  first  edition  but  I  will
never be able to thank them enough for
what they have done for me.

This  year,  the  University  of  Miami
Miller  School  of  Medicine  decided  to
create  the  Cosmetic  Medicine  and
Research  Institute  (CMRI),  which  con-
sists  of  cosmetic  dermatology,  oculo-
plastic surgery, facial plastic surgery and
nutrition.  The  role  of  this  multi-spe-
cialty institute is to provide cutting edge
dermatologic and surgical procedures to
enhance  appearance.  By  combining
accomplished physicians from the vari-
ous  cosmetic  specialties,  the  Institute
can offer patients the expertise of many
different types of physicians in order to
achieve the best outcome. The mission
of the Institute is to perform research in
the area of cosmetic medicine, and many
genetic initiatives to look for the genetic
influences  on  appearance  have  begun.
In  addition,  the  CMRI  will  provide
training to physicians on cosmetic der-
matology and cosmetic procedures. (See
www.derm.net for more information.)

I  am  very  proud  to  announce  that  I
have been selected to be the Director of
the  University  of  Miami  Cosmetic
Medicine  and  Research  Institute.    For
this honor I would like to thank several
people for believing in me and giving me
this opportunity:

Pascal Goldschmidt, MD (the Dean of
the  University  of  Miami  Medical
School)  –  Dr.  Goldschmidt  is  a  true
visionary  and  a  leader  in  the  field  of
the genetic influences in atherosclero-
sis. He opened the doors to basic sci-
ence  research  for  me  and  shared  his
genetic research team with me until I
could find funding. In addition, he did
the great honor of introducing me to
Bart  Chernow,  MD  and  William
O’Neil, MD (both of whom are Vice
Deans  at  the  University  of  Miami).
The  three  of  them  appointed  me
Director  of  the  University  of  Miami
Cosmetic  Medicine  and  Research
Institute and gave me one of the most
wonderful  opportunities  of  my  life.
Dr. Chernow is a brilliant man and a
true magician because he can pull all
kinds  of  opportunities  and  ideas  and
innovations  “out  of  his  hat.”  I  con-
sider  Bart  and  his  wife  Peggy  good
friends  and  I  thank  them  both  for
their support.

I would like to thank David Seo, MD,
my  partner  on  the  genetic  trials,  for
his patience in getting me up to speed
on  genetic  research.  My  fingers  are
crossed  that  we  will  discover  great
things  together  in  the  next  2  years.
Thanks to the doctors who are a part
of the CMRI and have chapters in this
text.  They  have  all  taught  me  so
much  and  are  great  to  work  with:
Drs. Lisa Grunebaum, Joely Kaufman,
Wendy Lee, Heather Woolery-Lloyd,

and  Larissa  Zaulyanov-Scanlan.
Thanks to Neal Shapiro for handling
the financial aspect of the Institute so
that  I  can  concentrate  on  my  true
loves…seeing  patients  and  perform-
ing research. Huge hugs and thanks to
Susan  Schaffer-RN  who  is  my  great

Basic Science of the
Epidermis 

Leslie Baumann, MD
Sogol Saghari, MD

The  skin  is  composed  of  three  primary
layers:  epidermis,  dermis,  and  subcuta-
neous  tissue.  Each 
layer  possesses 
specific  characteristics  and  functions.
Although research regarding skin layers
continues, much is already known about
the  structure  of  each  component.  New
discoveries  about  these  components
have  already  led  to  prenatal  diagnoses 
of  many  inherited  diseases  and  to
improved therapies. In the future, study
of  these  components  will  likely  lead  to
an  enhanced  understanding  of  skin
aging and the effects of topical products
on the biologic function of the skin.

The epidermis is the most superficial
layer  of  the  skin.  It  is  very  important
from a cosmetic standpoint, because it is
this  layer  that  gives  the  skin  its  texture
and  moisture,  and  contributes  to  skin
color.  If  the  surface  of  the  epidermis  is
dry  or  rough,  the  skin  appears  aged.
Knowledge of the basic structure of the
epidermis  best  enables  a  practitioner  to
improve the appearance of patients’ skin.

THE KERATINOCYTE

Keratinocytes,  also  known  as  corneo-
cytes,  are  the  cells  that  comprise  the
majority  of  the  epidermis.  Keratin  fila-
ments  are  major  components  of  the
keratinocytes,  and  provide  structural
support. There are two types of keratin
filaments:  acidic  (type  I,  K10–20)  and
basic (type II, K 1–10). They both must
be  expressed  for  a  keratin  filament  to

develop.1 In other words, an acidic type
and  a  basic  type  are  always  expressed
together  and  they  form  a  keratin  fila-
ment together. Keratinocytes are “born”
at the base of the epidermis at the der-
mal–epidermal junction (DEJ). They are
produced  by  stem  cells,  which  are  also
called basal cells because they reside at
the  base,  basal  layer,  of  the  epidermis.
When the stem cells divide, they create
“daughter  cells,”  which  slowly  migrate
to the top of the epidermis. This process
of  daughter  cells  maturing  and  moving
to the top is called keratinization. 

As  these  cells  progress  through  the
epidermis and mature, they develop dif-
ferent  characteristics.  The  layers  of  the
epidermis are named for these character-
istic  traits.  For  example,  as  mentioned,
the first layer is the basal layer because it
is  located  at  the  base  of  the  epidermis.
Basal  cells  are  cuboidal  in  shape.  The
next  layer  is  referred  to  as  the  spinous
layer because the cells in this layer have
prominent,  spiny  attachments  called
desmosomes. Desmosomes are complex
structures  composed  of  adhesion  mole-
cules and other proteins and are integral
in  cell  adhesion  and  cell  transport.  The
next layer is the granular layer, named so
because  these  cells  contain  visible  kera-
tohyaline  granules.  The  last,  outermost
layer is the stratum corneum (SC), a con-
densed mass of cells that have lost their
nuclei  and  granules  (Figs.  1-1  and  Fig.
1-2).  The  SC  is  covered  by  a  protein
material called the cell envelope, which
aids in providing a barrier to water loss
and absorption of unwanted materials.

As keratinocytes migrate through the
layers  of  the  epidermis,  their  contents
and  functions  change  according  to,  or
depending  on,  the  specific  epidermal
layer in which they are moving. Although
the  functions  of  the  keratinocyte  have
not  been  completely  elucidated,  many
of  them  are  understood.  It  is  known

that  keratinocyte  activity,  such  as  the
release of cytokines, can be affected by
topical  products  administered  to  the
skin.  Keratinocytes  and  their  compo-
nents  at  each  level  of  the  epidermis
starting  at  the  basal  layer  and  proceed-
ing  to  the  superficial  layers  of  the  epi-
dermis are described below.

Keratinocyte Function
THE  BASAL  LAYER  (STRATUM  BASALE)
Basal cells join with other basal and the
overlying spinous cells via desmosomes,
thus  forming  the  basement  membrane.
These  basal  keratinocytes  contain  ker-
atins 5 and 14, mutations in which result
in an inherited disease called epidermoly-
sis bullosa simplex. Keratins 5 and 14 are
presumed to establish a cytoskeleton that
permits flexibility of the cells. This flexi-
bility  allows  cells  to  proceed  out  of  the
basal layer and migrate superficially, thus
undergoing the keratinization process.

Basal cells are responsible for maintain-
ing the epidermis by continually renewing
the  cell  population.  Of  the  basal  layer,
10%  of  cells  are  stem  cells,  50%  are
amplifying cells, and 40% are postmitotic
cells.  Normally,  stem  cells  are  slowly
dividing cells, but under certain conditions
such  as  wound  healing  or  exposure  to
growth  factors,  they  divide  faster.  They
give  rise  to  transient  amplifying  cells.
Transient amplifying cells are responsible
for  most  of  the  cell  division  in  the  basal
layer and produce postmitotic cells, which
undergo  terminal  differentiation  and
move  superficially  to  become  suprabasal
cells that continue their upward migration
to  become  granular  cells  and  ultimately
part of the SC (Fig. 1-3).

THE SPINOUS LAYER (STRATUM SPINOSUM)
Keratins  1  and  10  are  first  seen  in  this
layer of suprabasal keratinocytes. These
keratins form a more rigid cytoskeleton

effect  on 

Calcium is known to be an inducer of
differentiation and a suppressor of prolif-
eration  in  epidermal  keratinocytes.9,10 It
has  been  shown  that  in  the  state  of  low
Ca2+ levels (0.05 mM), keratinocytes are in
a  proliferative  stage,  while  increases  in
Ca2+ levels (0.10–0.16 mM) lead to expres-
sion of differentiation markers such as ker-
atins 1 and 10, TGase, and filaggrin.9

Granular cells exhibit anabolic proper-
ties such as synthesis of filaggrin, corni-
fied  cell  envelope  proteins,  and  high
molecular  weight  keratins.  In  addition,
they show catabolic events such as dis-
solution of the nucleus and organelles.

THE HORNY LAYER (SC) The most superfi-
cial  layer  of  the  epidermis  is  the  SC  or
horny  layer,  which  is,  on  average,
approximately  15-cell  layers  thick.13,14
The  keratinocytes  that  reside  in  this
layer are the most mature and have com-
pleted the keratinization process. These
keratinocytes  contain  no  organelles  and
their  arrangement  resembles  a  brick
wall. The SC is composed of protein-rich
corneocytes embedded in a bilayer lipid
matrix assembled in a “brick and mortar”
fashion.  The  “bricks”  are  composed  of
keratinocytes  and  the  “mortar”  is  made
up  of  the  contents  extruded  from  the
lamellar  granules  including  lipids  and
proteins (Fig. 1-4). Cells of the midcorni-
fied layer have the most amino acid con-
tent and therefore have the highest capa-
bility  for  binding  to  water,  while  the

dermis.  The  “granules”  represent  kerato-
hyaline granules, which contain profilag-
grin,  the  precursor  to  filaggrin.  The  pro-
tein filaggrin cross-links keratin filaments
providing strength and structure. The pro-
teins  of  the  cornified  cell  envelope
(involucrin, keratolinin, pancornulins, and
loricrin)  are  cross-linked  in  this  layer  by
the calcium-requiring enzyme transgluta-
minase (TGase) to form the cell envelope.
There are four types of transglutaminases
present in the epidermis: TGase 1 or ker-
atinocyte  TGase,  TGase  2  or  tissue
TGase, TGase 3 or epidermal TGase, and
TGase 5. Only TGases 1, 3, and 5 partici-
pate  in  the  development  of  the  corneo-
cyte  envelope  (CE)  formation.  TGase  2
has  other  functions  including  a  role  in
apoptosis  (programmed  cell  death).  It  is
known that TGase activity increases with

BOX 1-1
1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] stimulates differentiation and prohibits proliferation of
the keratinocytes. It exerts its effects via the nuclear hormone receptor known as vitamin D
receptor (VDR). VDR operates with the aid of coactivator complexes. There are two known coacti-
vator complexes: vitamin D interacting protein complex (DRIP) and the p160 steroid receptor
coactivator family (SRC/p160). It has been proposed that the DRIP mediator complex is involved
in proliferation and early differentiation while the SRC/p160 complex is engaged in advanced dif-
ferentiation.11 The vitamin D receptors of undifferentiated keratinocytes bind to the DRIP com-
plex, inducing early differentiation markers of K1 and K10.12 The DRIP complex on the vitamin D
receptor is then replaced by the SRC complex. The SRC complex induces gene transcription for
advanced differentiation, which occurs with ﬁlaggrin and loricrin.12 The replacement of the DRIP
complex with the SRC complex on the vitamin D receptor is believed to be necessary for ker-
atinocyte differentiation. It is important to realize that vitamin D levels are lower in older people
and that this reduction may play a role in the slower wound healing characteristic in the elderly.

that confers greater mechanical strength
to  the  cell.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that
under hyperproliferative conditions such
as actinic keratosis, wound healing, and
psoriasis,  keratins  6  and  16  are  upregu-
lated in the suprabasal keratinocytes.

Lamellar  granules,  which  are  consid-
ered the first sign of keratinization, first
appear in this layer. They contain lipids
such as ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty
acids  as  well  as  enzymes  such  as  pro-
teases,  acid  phosphatase,  lipases,  and
glycosidases. It has been recently shown
that  cathelicidin,  an  antimicrobial
peptide,  is  also  stored  in  the  lamellar
granules.2 These granules migrate to the
surface and expel their contents by exo-
cytosis. The released lipids coat the sur-
face,  imparting  barrier-like  properties.
Desmosomes are very prominent in this
layer,  thus  accounting  for  the  name
“spinous layer.” 

The advanced stage of differentiation
of suprabasal keratinocytes is conducive
to  staining  for  products  not  found  on
basal  cells  (i.e.,  sugar  complexes  and
blood  group  antigens).  The  cytoplasm
contains proteins not found in the lower
layers  such  as  involucrin,  keratolinin,
and  loricrin.  These  proteins  become
cross-linked in the SC to confer strength
to the layer.

THE GRANULAR LAYER (STRATUM GRANULO-
SUM) Granular layer keratinocytes reside
in the uppermost viable layer of the epi-

4

 
 
 
threonine  kinase  receptor.  TGF-(cid:3)1  and 
TGF-(cid:3)2 are present in small amounts in
the  keratinocytes.  The  presence  of
calcium,  phorbol  esters,  as  well  as 
TGF-(cid:3) itself  increases  the  epidermal
TGF-(cid:3) level  and  promotes  differentia-
tion.23 TGF-(cid:3) has  also  been  proven  to
have a role in scarring, and antibodies to
this factor have been shown to decrease
the  inflammatory  response  in  wounds
and reduce scarring.24, 25

ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES

Antimicrobial  peptides  (AMPs)  have
recently  become  an  area  of  interest
because of their involvement in the innate
immune  system  of  human  skin.  AMPs
exhibit  broad-spectrum  activity  against
bacteria,  viruses,  and  fungi.26,27 The
cationic peptide of the AMPs attracts the
negatively  charged  bacteria,  becoming
pervasive  in  the  bacterial  membrane  in
the process, and ultimately eliminates the
bacteria. Cathelicidin and defensin are the
two  major  groups  of  AMPs  believed  to
have  an  influence  in  the  antimicrobial
defense of the skin. Cathelicidin has been
identified in the keratinocytes of human
skin at the area of inflammation, as well
as  in  eccrine  and  salivary  glands.28–30 In
addition to antimicrobial activity, catheli-
cidin  LL-37  demonstrates  a  stimulatory
effect on keratinocyte proliferation in the
process  of  wound  healing.31 Pig  catheli-
cidin  PR-39  has  been  shown  to  induce
proteoglycans  production  (specifically,
syndecan-1  and  -4)  in  the  extracellular
matrix in wound repair.32 Defensin is also
expressed  in  the  human  keratinocytes33
and  mucous  membranes.34,35 (cid:3)-Defensin
1 seems to promote differentiation in the
keratinocytes by increasing expression of
keratin 10.36 Interestingly, UVB radiation
has been shown to increase the levels of
human  (cid:3)-defensin  mRNA  in  the  ker-
atinocytes.37

AMPs have been demonstrated to be
involved in several dermatologic condi-
tions including atopic dermatitis, psoria-
sis, and leprosy,27 as well as wound heal-
ing, all of which are beyond the scope of
our discussion. The role of AMPs in the
epidermal  barrier  will  be  discussed  in
Chapter 11.

MOISTURIZATION OF THE SC

The  main  function  of  the  SC  is  to
prevent  TEWL  and  regulate  the  water
balance in the skin. The two major com-
ponents  that  allow  the  SC  to  perform
this role are lipids and the NMF.

deeper  layers  have  less  water-binding
capacity.15  The  SC  is  described  as  the
“dead  layer”  of  cells  because  these  cells
do not exhibit protein synthesis and are
unresponsive to cellular signaling.16

The horny layer functions as a protec-
tive  barrier.  One  of  its  protective  func-
tions is to prevent transepidermal water
loss  (TEWL).  Amino  acids  and  their
metabolites,  which  are  by-products
formed from the breakdown of filaggrin,
comprise  a  substance  known  as  the 
natural  moisturizing  factor 
(NMF).
Intracellularly-located  NMF  and  lipids
released  by  the 
lamellar  granules,
located  extracellularly,  play  an  impor-
tant  role  in  skin  hydration,  suppleness,
and flexibility (see Chapter 11).

The Cell Cycle

The  above  keratinization  process  is  also
referred to as the “cell cycle.” The normal
cell cycle of the epidermis is from 26 to 42
days.17 This series of events, known also
as desquamation, normally occurs invisi-
bly  with  shedding  of  individual  cells  or
small clumps of cells. Disturbances of this
process may result in the accumulation of
partially  detached  keratinocytes,  which
cause  the  clinical  findings  of  dry  skin.
Disease  states  may  also  alter  the  cell
cycle. For example, psoriasis causes a dra-
matic shortening of the cell cycle, result-
ing in the formation of crusty cutaneous
eruptions. The cell cycle lengthens in time
as  humans  age.18 This  means  that  the
cells at the superficial layer of the SC are
older and their function may be impaired.
Results from such compromised function-
ing include slower wound healing and a
skin  appearance  that  is  dull  and  lifeless.
Many  cosmetic  products  such  as  retinol
and  alpha  hydroxy  acids  are  believed  to

quicken the pace of the cell cycle, yielding
younger  keratinocytes  at  the  superficial
layers  of  the  SC,  thus  imparting  a  more
youthful appearance to the skin.

GROWTH FACTORS

Growth  factors  can  be  classified  into
two  groups:  proliferative  and  differen-
tiative  factors.  Proliferative  factors
engender  more  DNA  synthesis  and
result  in  proliferation  of  the  cells.
Differentiative  factors  inhibit  the  pro-
duction  of  DNA  and  suppress  growth,
thereby  resulting  in  differentiation  of
the  keratinocytes.  Epidermal  growth
factor  (EGF)  is  one  of  the  integral
chemokines in the regulation of growth
in human cells. It binds to the epidermal
growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)  located
on the basal and suprabasal cells in the
epidermis  and  activates  tyrosine  kinase
activity, which ultimately results in pro-
liferation  of  the  cells.19 Keratinocyte
growth  factor  (KGF),  a  member  of  the
fibroblast growth factor family, also has
a  proliferative  effect  via  the  tyrosine
kinase  receptor  on  epidermal  cells.20 It
has been shown that KGF contributes to
and enhances wound healing.21 In addi-
tion,  KGF  has  been  demonstrated 
to  enhance  hyaluronan  synthesis  in 
the  keratinocytes.22 Other  important
growth  factors  include  the  polypeptide
transforming  growth  factors,  which
consist  of  two  types:  Transforming
growth factor alpha  (TGF-(cid:2)) and  trans-
forming  growth  factor  beta  (TGF-(cid:3)).
They  differ  in  both  configuration  and
function. TGF-(cid:2) is a proliferative factor,
similar to EGF, and works by stimulating
a  tyrosine  kinase  response.  TGF-(cid:3),
which includes three subtypes (1–3), is
a  differentiative  factor  with  a  serine/

Filaggrin, named for ﬁlament aggregating
protein, derived its name from the fact that it
binds keratin ﬁlaments to form a structural
matrix in the SC. Genetic defects in the ﬁlag-
grin gene are known to play a role in a sub-
set of ichthyosis vulgaris cases.38
Interestingly, ﬁlaggrin is not present in the
superﬁcial layers of the SC. Studies have
shown that it is completely degraded into
amino acids within 2 to 3 days of proﬁlaggrin
formation and its constituents are further
metabolized to form the NMF.40 This is
nature’s way of keeping its water-binding
capabilities in the top layer of the SC where
they are needed while preventing the lower
layers of the SC from being disrupted by
having too much water present. In addition,
the level of NMF is regulated by the water
activity present in the SC.

Natural Moisturizing Factor

Released by the lamellar granules, NMF
is  composed  of  amino  acids  and  their
metabolites,  which  are  by-products
formed from the breakdown of filaggrin
(Box  1-2).  NMF  is  found  exclusively
inside the cells of the SC and gives the
SC its humectant (water-binding) quali-
ties (Fig. 1-5). NMF is composed of very
water-soluble  chemicals;  therefore,  it
can absorb large amounts of water, even
when  humidity  levels  are  low.  This
allows the SC to retain a high water con-
tent  even  in  a  dry  environment.  The
NMF  also  provides  an  important  aque-
ous  environment  for  enzymes  that

require such conditions to function. The
importance  of  NMF  is  clear  when  one
notes  that  ichthyosis  vulgaris  patients,
who  have  been  shown  to  lack  NMF,
manifest  severe  dryness,  and  scaling  of
the skin.38 It has been demonstrated that
normal  skin  exposed  to  normal  soap
washing has significantly lower levels of
NMF  when  compared  to  normal  skin
not washed with surfactants.39 NMF lev-
els  have  also  been  reported  to  decline
with  age,  which  may  contribute  to  the
increased  incidence  of  dry  skin  in  the
elderly population (see Chapter 11).

Lipids

In  order  of  abundance,  the  composition
of  skin  surface  lipids  includes  triglyc-
erides,  fatty  acids,  squalene,  wax  esters,
diglycerides, cholesterol esters, and cho-
lesterol.41 These lipids are an integral part
of the epidermis and are involved in pre-
venting TEWL and the entry of harmful
bacteria. They also help prevent the skin
from absorbing water-soluble agents. For
decades  it  has  been  known  that  the
absence  of  lipids  in  the  diet  leads  to
unhealthy  skin  (see  Chapter  11).  More
recently, it has been shown that inherited
defects  in  lipid  metabolism,  such  as  the
deficiency of steroid sulfatase seen in X-
linked  ichthyosis,  will  lead  to  abnormal
skin keratinization and hydration.42 It is
now known that SC lipids are affected by
age, genetics, seasonal variation, and diet.
Deficiency of these lipids predisposes the
individual  to  dry  skin.  This  has  been

demonstrated in mice with essential fatty
acid  deficiency  (EFAD);  when  fed  a  diet
deficient in linoleic acid these mice devel-
oped  increased  TEWL.43 Interestingly,
administration  of  hypocholesterolemic
drugs has also been associated with dry
skin changes.44

Skin  lipids  are  produced  in  and
extruded  from  lamellar  granules  as
described  above  or  are  synthesized  in
the sebaceous glands and then excreted
to  the  skin’s  surface  through  the  hair
follicle. The excretion of sebum by seba-
ceous  glands  is  hormonally  controlled
(see  Chapter  10).  Lipids  help  keep  the
NMF inside the cells where it is needed
to  keep  cells  hydrated  and  aqueous
enzymes  functioning.  Although  this  is
less well characterized, lipids can them-
selves influence enzyme function.

ROLE OF LIPIDS IN TEWL

The major lipids found in the SC that con-
tribute  to  the  water  permeability  barrier
are ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids.
Since  the  1940s,  when  the  SC  was
first identified as the primary barrier to
water loss, many hypotheses have been
entertained  as  to  exactly  which  lipids
are  important  in  the  SC.  The  research
with the EFAD mice described above led
to  a  focus  on  phospholipids  because
they  contain  linoleic  acid.  However,  it
was  later  found  that  phospholipids  are
almost completely absent from the SC.40
In  1982,  ceramide  1  was  discovered.
This  lipid  compound  is  rich  in  linoleic
acid and is believed to play a major role
in structuring SC lipids essential for bar-
rier  function.45 Later,  five  more  distinct
types of ceramides were discovered and
named  according  to  the  polarity  of  the
molecule.  Ceramide  1  is  the  most  non-
polar and ceramide 6 is the most polar.

Although  the  ceramides  were  once
thought to be the key to skin moisturiza-
tion, studies now suggest that no particu-
lar lipid is more important than the oth-
ers. It appears that the proportion of fatty
acids,  ceramides,  and  cholesterol  is  the
most  important  parameter.  This  was
demonstrated  in  a  study  in  which  after
altering  the  water  barrier  with  acetone,
the  application  of  a  combination  of
ceramides,  fatty  acids,  and  cholesterol
resulted  in  normal  barrier  recovery.46
Application of each of the separate enti-
ties  alone  resulted  in  delayed  barrier
recovery.  Manufacturers  now  include
ceramides or a mixture of ceramides, cho-
lesterol,  and  fatty  acids  in  several  avail-
able products as a result of these findings.
However,  the  use  of  these  mixtures  to

 
 
 
treat  atopic  dermatitis  and  other  ichthy-
otic disorders has been disappointing.

SUMMARY

The epidermis is implicated in many of
the skin complaints of cosmetic patients.
It  is  the  state  of  the  epidermis  that
causes the skin to feel rough and appear
dull. A flexible, well-hydrated epidermis
is more supple and radiant than a dehy-
drated epidermis. The popularity of buff
puffs,  exfoliating  scrubs,  masks,  mois-
turizers,  chemical  peels,  and  microder-
mabrasion  attest  to  the  obsession  that
cosmetic  patients  have  with  the  condi-
tion of their epidermis. It is important to
understand the properties of the epider-
mis  in  order  to  understand  which  cos-
metic products and procedures can truly
benefit patients as opposed to those that
are based on myths or hype.

The  dermis  lies    between  the  epidermis
and the subcutaneous fat. It is responsible
for  the  thickness  of  the  skin,  and  as  a
result  plays  a  key  role  in  the  cosmetic
appearance of the skin. The thickness of
the  dermis  varies  over  different  parts  of
the  body  and  the  size  doubles  between
the  ages  of  3  and  7  years  and  again  at
puberty.  With  aging,  this  basic  layer
decreases in thickness and moisture. The
dermis, which is laden with nerves, blood
vessels, and sweat glands, consists mostly
of  collagen.  The  uppermost  portion  of
this layer, which lies beneath the epider-
mis, is known as the papillary dermis and
the lower portion is known as the reticu-
lar  dermis.  Smaller  collagen  bundles,
greater cellularity, and a higher density in
its  vascular  elements  characterize  the
papillary dermis as compared to the retic-
ular dermis.  Fibroblasts  are  the  primary
cell  type  in  the  dermis.  They  produce
collagen,  elastin,  other  matrix  proteins,
and  enzymes  such  as  collagenase  and
stromelysin.  These  structural  compo-
nents  will  be  discussed  individually
because  each  exhibits  significant  charac-
teristics that influence the function of the
skin.  Immune  cells  such  as  mast  cells,
polymorphonuclear  leukocytes,  lympho-
cytes,  and  macrophages  are  also  present
in the dermis.

The  junction  between  the  epidermis
and  dermis  is  known  as  the  dermal–
epidermal junction (DEJ) (Fig. 2-1). Much

is known about the attachment proteins
found in the basement membrane of the
DEJ.  At  this  point  there  are  no  known
cosmetic  implications  for  this  area,  as
such a discussion is beyond the scope of
this  book.  Instead,  this  chapter  will
focus on the components of the dermis
that are known to be important in aging.

COLLAGEN 

Collagen,  one  of  the  strongest  natural
proteins  and  the  most  abundant  one  in
humans as well as in skin, imparts dura-
bility  and  resilience  to  the  skin.  It  has
been  the  focus  of  much  antiaging
research  and  the  target  of  several  skin
products  and  procedures.  The  impor-
tance  of  collagen  is  emphasized  in  the
literature regarding many of the topical
agents that are touted to increase colla-
gen synthesis such as glycolic and ascor-
bic acids. Resurfacing techniques such as
the  CO2 laser  and  dermabrasion  are
intended  to  change  collagen  structure,
thereby improving skin texture. Various
forms  of  collagen  are  injected  into  the
dermis to replace damaged collagen and
to reverse the signs of aging. Finally, top-
ical  retinoids  have  been  shown  to
reduce the collagen damage that occurs
because of sun exposure. These sundry

aspects  of  collagen  health  or  replace-
ment  will  be  discussed  separately  in
upcoming chapters; however, it is neces-
sary first to gain an understanding of the
structure and function of collagen.

“Collagen”  is  actually  a  complex
family of 18 proteins, 11 of which are
present  in  the  dermis.  Collagen  fibers
are  always  seen  in  the  dermis  in  the
final,  mature  state  of  assembly  as
opposed to elastin, the immature fibers
of which are seen in the superficial der-
mis with the more mature fibers found
in the deeper layer of the dermis. Each
type  of  collagen  is  composed  of  three
chains  (Fig.  2-2).  Collagen  is  synthe-
sized  in  the  fibroblasts  in  a  precursor
form called procollagen. Proline residues
on the procollagen chain are converted
to hydroxyproline by the enzyme pro-
lyl hydroxylase. This reaction requires
the presence of Fe++, ascorbic acid (vit-
amin  C),  and  (cid:2)-ketoglutarate.  Lysine
residues  on  the  procollagen  chain  are
also  converted  to  hydroxylysine;  in
this case, by the enzyme lysyl hydrox-
ylase.  This  reaction  also  requires  the
presence  of  Fe++,  ascorbic  acid,  and 
(cid:2)-ketoglutarate. It is interesting to note
that a deficiency of vitamin C, which is
an  essential  mediating  component  in
these  reactions,  leads  to  scurvy,  a  dis-
ease  characterized  by  decreased  colla-
gen production.

Collagen Glycation

Glycation of extracellular matrix (ECM)
collagen  and  proteins  plays  an  impor-
tant  role  in  the  aging  process.  This  is
not  to  be  confused  with  glycosylation
of collagen, which is an enzyme-medi-
ated process in the intracellular step of
collagen  biosynthesis.  Glycation  is  a
nonenzymatic series of biologic events
that  involves  adding  a  reducing  sugar
molecule  (such  as  glucose  or  fructose)
to  ECM  collagen  and  proteins.  This
reaction  is  also  known  as  the  Maillard 
reaction.  The  sugar  molecule  mainly
reacts with the amino group side chains

of  lysine  and  arginine  of  collagen  and
ECM proteins. Subsequently, the prod-
uct of this process undergoes oxidative
reactions  resulting  in  the  formation  of
advanced  glycation  end  products
(AGEs)  (Fig.  2-3).  AGEs  have  been
implicated in the aging process and age-
related diseases such as diabetes melli-
tus,1–3 chronic  renal  failure,4,5 and
Alzheimer’s  disease.6–8 It  is  believed
that  with  time,  AGEs  increase,9 accu-
mulate on human collagen10 and elastin
fibers,11 and contribute to aging of the
skin.  As  a  result  of  glycation,  collagen
networks  lose  their  ability  to  contract,
and they become stiffer and resistant to
remodeling.  Fibroblasts  are  key  ele-
ments for collagen contracture, as they
apply contracture force on the collagen
lattice  via  their  actin  cytoskeleton.12
Glycated  collagen  modifies  the  actin
cytoskeleton of the fibroblasts thereby
diminishing  their  collagen  contraction
capacity.13 Fibroblasts  also  secrete  col-
lagenase  (MMP-1),  which  is  essential
for collagen turnover. Glycated collagen
has  been  proven  to  decrease  levels 
of  collagenase  I  (MMP-1),  leading  to 
less  tissue  remodeling.14 Studies  have
shown that UV exposure may also con-
tribute  to  the  production  and  function
(cid:4)-(carboxymethyl)  lysine
of  AGEs.  Ne

(CML) is one of the AGEs in which the
amino  side  chain  of  lysine  is  reduced.
This product was shown to accumulate
on elastin tissue of photoaged skin and
proven  to  be  higher  in  sun-exposed
skin  as  compared  to  sun-protected
skin.11 In addition, it has been proposed
that  AGE-modified  proteins  act  as
endogenous photosensitizers in human
skin  via  oxidative  stress  mechanisms
induced by UVA light.15

The Key Types of Collagen Found in
the Dermis (Table 2-1)

Type I collagen comprises 80% to 85%
of the dermal matrix and is responsible
for  the  tensile  strength  of  the  dermis.
The  amount  of  collagen  I  has  been
shown  to  be  lower  in  photoaged  skin,
and to be increased after dermabrasion
procedures.16 Therefore, it is likely that
collagen  I  is  the  most  important  colla-
gen type in regard to skin aging. Type III
is  the  second  most  important  form  of
collagen in the dermis, making up any-
where  from  10%  to  15%  of  the
matrix.17 This  collagen  type  has  a
smaller diameter than type I and forms
smaller  bundles  allowing  for  skin  plia-
bility. Type III, also known as “fetal col-
lagen”  because  it  predominates  in

life, 

embryonic 
in  higher
amounts  around  the  blood  vessels  and
beneath the epidermis.

is  seen 

The  other  types  of  collagen  that  are
noteworthy  for  a  cosmetic  dermatolo-
gist are type IV collagen, which forms a
structure lattice that is found in the base-
ment membrane zone and type V colla-
gen,  which  is  diffusely  distributed
throughout  the  dermis  and  comprises
roughly 4% to 5% of the matrix. Type
VII collagen makes up the anchoring fib-
rils  in  the  DEJ.  Type  XVII  collagen  is
located  in  the  hemidesmosome  and
plays  an  important  structural  role  as
well. The importance of these collagens
and  other  structural  proteins  is  evident
in  genetic  diseases  characterized  by  a
lack of these structures and in acquired
diseases  characterized  by  antibody  for-
mation  to  these  important  structures.
For example, patients with an inherited
blistering  disease  known  as  dominant
dystrophic  epidermolysis  have  been
shown to have a scarcity of type VII col-
lagen  with  resulting  abnormalities  in
their anchoring fibrils. An acquired bul-
lous  disease,  epidermolysis  bullosa
acquisita (EBA), is caused by antibodies
to this same collagen type VII. Although
the  discussion  of  these  diseases  is
beyond the scope of this text, it is inter-
esting  that  patients  with  chronic  sun
exposure have also been found to have
alterations  in  collagen  type  VII.  This
may contribute to the skin fragility seen
in  elderly  patients.  Some  investigators
have  postulated  that  a  weakened  bond
between  the  dermis  and  epidermis
caused  by  loss  of  the  anchoring  fibrils
(collagen  VII)  may  lead  to  wrinkle  for-
mation.18 The  importance  of  collagen
and  changes  seen  in  aged  skin  will  be
discussed further in Chapter 6.

The  elastic  fiber’s  structure  provides
clues  about  its  ability  to  interact  with
HA  and  collagen.  Mature  elastic  fibers
contain  an  array  of  proteoglycans.
Versican is one of the most widely stud-
ied proteoglycans28 and is a member of
the hyaluronan binding family that also
includes  aggrecan  and  neurocan.
Versican  contributes  to  cell  adhesion,
proliferation,  and  migration  and  can
interact with multiple ECM proteins to
mediate assembly. Mature elastic fibers
are  found  at  the  periphery  of  collagen
bundles, offering a clue that elastin has
important  interactions  with  collagen  as
well as with HA.

Elastic  fibers  are  degraded  by  the  elas-
tolytic enzymes such as human leukocyte
elastase  (HLE).  With  significant  levels  of
sun exposure, elastin degrades and is seen
as an amorphous substance in the dermis
when  viewed  by  light  microscopy.  This
resultant  “elastosis”  is  a  hallmark  of  pho-
toaged skin. Interestingly, there are protec-
tive  mechanisms  in  the  skin  preventing
elastin  degradation.  Lysozymes  are
believed  to  play  a  protective  role  in  this
matter. They have been shown to increase
and  deposit  on  the  elastin  fibers  of  UV-
exposed  skin.29 By  binding  to  the  elastin,
the lysozymes prevent the proper interac-
tion between elastase and elastin,30 thereby
inhibiting  the  proteolytic  activity  of  the
elastolytic  enzymes.30,31 It  is  also  believed
that  damage  to  the  elastin  fibers  leads  to
the  decreased  skin  elasticity seen  in  aged
skin.32 Defects or damage to elastin may
lead  to  wrinkles  even  in  the  absence  of
sun  exposure  and  aging.  Indeed,  in  one
case,  a  child  with  “wrinkled  skin  syn-
drome” was shown to have a deficiency
of  elastin  fibers,33 which  demonstrates
the importance of elastin in skin integrity.
Defective  elastic  fibers  can  give  rise  to
multiple  dermatologic  diseases  including
cutis  laxa,  pseudoxanthoma  elasticum

domains,  which  are  rich  in  proline,
valine,  and  glycine,  are  believed  to  be
responsible  for  the  elasticity  of  the
tissue.24 The  hydrophilic
elastin 
domains  on  the  other  hand  are  rich  in
alanine and lysine, and interact with the
enzyme  lysyl  oxidase  in  the  process  of
cross-linking.25 The  cross-linking  of
elastin  is  a  complex  process  necessary
for its proper function and stability. This
process  is  mediated  via  the  copper-
requiring  enzyme  lysyl  oxidase,26 and
the subsequent formation of desmosine
and  isodesmosine  cross-links,  which
result in an insoluble elastin network.27
Elastin  is  fascinating  and  although
much is known about it, its  relevance in
cosmetic  dermatology  is  unclear.  It
seems  certain  that  collagen,  hyaluronic
acid  (HA),  and  elastin  bind  each  other
covalently and make up a three-dimen-
sional structure that is impaired in aged
skin.  There  is  a  commonly  held  belief
that  these  three  components  must  be
increased in order to give skin a younger
appearance.  However,  the  trick  is  that
de  novo  elastin  production  does  not
occur  in  adulthood.  Trying  to  increase
production  of  elastin  in  adults  will
surely be a focus of cosmetic dermatol-
ogy research in the future.

and  elasticity  to  skin  as  well  as  other
organs such as the lungs and blood ves-
sels. Elastogenesis starts during fetal life
and reaches its maximum near birth and
the  early  neonatal  period.  It  then
decreases  significantly  and  is  virtually
nonexistent  by  adult  life.  Elastic  fibers
have two components. Their main com-
ponent is elastin, an amorphous, insolu-
ble  connective  tissue  protein.  Elastin  is
surrounded  by  microfibrils,  the  second
component.  Elastin  constitutes  2%  to
3% of the dry weight of skin, 3% to 7%
of  lung,  28%  to  32%  of  major  blood
vessels, and 50% of elastic ligaments.19
Elastin is produced from its precursor
tropoelastin in the fibroblasts as well as
endothelial  cells  and  vascular  smooth
muscle  cells.  In  contrast  to  collagen
fibers,  elastin  fibers  are  present  in  the
dermis in various levels of maturity. The
least  mature  fibers  are  called  oxytalan.
They  course  perpendicularly  from  the
DEJ  to  the  top  of  the  reticular  dermis.
More  mature  elastin  fibers,  called
elaunin,  then  attach  to  a  horizontal
plexus  of  fibers  found  in  the  reticular
dermis. Elaunin is more mature because
it has more elastin deposited on the fib-
rillin  mesh.  The  most  mature  elastin
fibers  are  unnamed  and  are  found
deeper in the reticular dermis (Fig. 2-5).
Microfibrils  play  a  very  important
role in elastogenesis and act as a scaffold
for  tropoelastin  deposition  and  assem-
bly.20 Microfibrils  are  primarily  com-
posed of glycoproteins from the fibrillin
family and microfibril-associated glyco-
protein (MAGP)-1 and -2. Fibrillin-1 has
been  shown  to  be  important  in  elastic
fiber development21 and wound repair.22
Microfibrils are adjacent to tropoelastin-
producing cells and parallel to the devel-
oping  elastin  fiber.23 The  microfibrils
form a template on which tropoelastin is
deposited.  The  tropoelastin  polypep-
tides are then covalently cross-linked to
form  elastin.  Tropoelastin  polypeptides
contain  alternating  hydrophilic  and
hydrophobic  regions.  The  hydrophobic

(PXE),  elastosis  perforans  serpiginosa
(also  known  as  Lutz-Miescher’s  syn-
drome),  and  dermatofibrosis  lenticu-
laris  (also  known  as Buschke-Ollendorf 
syndrome).

Studies  have  demonstrated  a  reduc-
tion  in  the  elastin  content  in  protected
areas of the skin with aging. In a study
performed on Egyptian subjects, the rela-
tive  amount  of  elastin  in  the  non-UV-
exposed  abdominal  skin  significantly
decreased from 49.2% (cid:5) 0.6% in the first
decade  to  30.4% (cid:5) 0.8%  in  the  ninth
decade.34 Another study on elastin con-
tent  in  the  nonexposed  buttock  skin  of
91 Caucasians between 20 and 80 years
of  age  showed  a  reduction  of  51%  in
elastin  tissue.31 Although  UV  exposure
may result in elastosis and a higher con-
tent of elastin tissue, the elastic fibers are
rendered structurally abnormal,34 which
is microscopically seen as thickened and
twisted granular deposits of elastin in the
dermis.

skin 

Replacing  the  elastin  component  of
the ECM has always posed a challenge
in 
rejuvenation  approaches.
Researchers  have  investigated  the  pro-
duction of recombinant and cross-linked
tropoelastin  in  great  detail.35 However,
since  it  is  very  difficult  to  have  elastin
pass  through  human  skin,  stimulating
the dermis to produce elastin may be an
alternative  option.  Recently,  zinc  has
become a subject of interest as an elastin
tissue  stimulator  in  the  skin.  Zinc  has
been  shown  to  increase  the  epidermal
growth  factor  (EGF)  receptor  signaling
pathway.36 It  increases  protein  tyrosine
phosphorylation  by  inhibiting  protein
tyrosine  phosphatase  (PTPase),37 and
activates  mitogen-activated  protein
(MAP)  kinases,38 which  are  important
for  cosignaling  in  ECM  production.
Clinical 
suggested
studies  have 
improvement in the elasticity of perioc-
ular  skin  following  use  of  a  patented
zinc complex topical preparation.39 In a
4-week study of 27 female subjects with
a zinc complex-containing eye product,
overall  improvement  of  the  eye  area
was  noted  by  78%,  reduction  of  fine
lines by 74%, and firmer skin by 70% of
the  patients.39 These  studies,  although
promising,  need  to  be  conducted  in  a
larger patient population.

bolin  are  also  present  in  the  dermis.
Fibronectin  is  a  filamentous  GP  that
mediates  platelet  binding  to  collagen,
development of granulation tissue, and
reepithelialization.  Chemotactic  for
monocytes,  fibronectin  contains  six
binding  sites  including  one  for  colla-
gen, two for heparin, and a region that
binds  fibrin.  Tenascin  is  abundant  in
developing  skin  but  found  only  in  the
papillary  dermis  in  adult  skin.  These
matrix  components  play  a  significant
role  in  tissue  remodeling  and  are
important in wound healing following
cosmetic procedures.

GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS

Glycosaminoglycans  (GAGs)  are  poly-
saccharide chains composed of repeating
disaccharide  units  linked  to  a  core  pro-
tein.  Together  the  GAGs  and  attached
core  protein  form  proteoglycans.  All
GAGs except for HA are synthesized in
Golgi  apparatus.  HA  is  the  only  GAG
that  is  not  produced  on  a  core  protein;
rather,  it  is  synthesized  by  an  enzyme
complex of the plasma membrane.40

Although  all  the  functions  of  GAGs
are  not  understood,  it  is  known  that
these compounds avidly bind water and
may  contribute  to  the  maintenance  of
salt and water balance. GAGs are found
in areas with a fibrous matrix where cells
are  closely  associated  but  have  little
space  for  free  movement.  Most  studies
on  human  skin  show  an  age-related
decline in GAG content. The most abun-
dant GAGs in the dermis are HA, which
is  the  only  nonsulfated  GAG,  and  der-
matan  sulfate.  The  other  GAGs  include
heparin sulfate, heparin, keratan sulfate,
chondroitin-4, and chondroitin-6-sulfate.
HA is a very important component of
the dermis that is responsible for attract-
ing water and giving the dermis its vol-
ume. The name reflects its glassy appear-
ance (the Greek word for glass is hyalos)
and  the  presence  of  a  sugar  known  as
uronic  acid.  HA  is  known  to  be  impor-
tant  in  cell  growth,  membrane  receptor

function,  and  adhesion.  Its  structure  is
identical,  whether  it  is  derived  from
bacterial  cultures,  animals,  or  humans
(Fig.  2-6). HA  appears  freely  in  the  der-
mis  and  is  more  concentrated  in  areas
where  cells  are  less  densely  packed.  In
young skin, HA is found at the periphery
of collagen and elastin fibers and at the
interface of these types of fibers. These
connections with HA are absent in aged
skin.41 HA is a popular ingredient in cos-
metic  products  because  it  acts  as  a
humectant.  Several  types  are  also  avail-
able in an injectable version for the treat-
ment  of  wrinkles  (see  Chapter  23).  HA
appears  to  also  play  a  role  in  ker-
atinocyte  differentiation  and  formation
of lamellar bodies via its interaction with
CD44,42 a  cell  surface  glycoprotein
receptor with HA binding sites.43–45

Decorin  is  a  member  of  the  small
leucine-rich  proteoglycans 
(SLRPs)
found in the extracelluar matrix protein.
Its  name  is  derived  from  its  apparent
“decorating” of collagen fibers. Decorin
contains  a  core  protein  with  a  high
content  of  leucine  repeats  and  GAG
chains  of  dermatan  or  chondroitin  sul-
fate.  It  is  shaped  in  a  “horseshoe”  pat-
tern and binds to collagen fibrils, result-
in  their  proper  organization.46
ing 
Decorin-deficient mice have shown clin-
ical  skin  fragility  and  irregular  collagen
fibrils with increased interfibrillar space
on  histology.47 In  addition  to  collagen
fibrillogenesis,  decorin  interacts  with
fibronectin48 and  fibrinogen,49 thereby
playing  a  role  in  wound  healing  and
hemostasis. Another interesting function
of decorin is that it reduces the prolifera-
tion  of  cells  in  neoplasms  by  stopping
their  growth  in  the  G1 phase  of  the 
cell  cycle.50 Carrino et  al.51 studied  the 
catabolic  fragment  of  decorin  in  adult
skin. They noted a higher content of the
altered  decorin  in  adult  dermis  as
opposed  to  nonmeasurable  amounts  in
fetal  skin  and  named  it  “decorunt.”
Decorunt  was  shown  to  have  a  lower
affinity  for  collagen  fibrils.  This  finding
may explain some of the changes related
to collagen disorganization in aging skin.

MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES

The ECM architecture of human skin is
based  on  its  continuous  remodeling.
This  process  requires  ECM-degrading
enzymes  followed  by  synthesis  and
deposition  of  new  molecules.  The
matrix  metalloproteinases 
(MMPs),
which  include  a  large  family  of  zinc-
dependent  endopeptidases,  are  crucial
to  the  turnover  of  ECM  components.
Interstitial  collagenase,  or  MMP-1,  was
the  first  enzyme  discovered  in  this
group.  MMP-1  is  secreted  from  the
fibroblasts and is mainly involved in the
degradation  of  collagen  types  I,  II,  and
III,  but  has  been  shown  to  also  cleave
the  anchoring  fibrils  of  collagen  VII.52
Human  neutrophil  collagenase  (MMP-
8),  another  type  of  collagenase,  is
engaged in cleaving collagen types I and
III. Collagenase 3 (MMP-13) is the third
member of this group of enzymes, and it
is known to fragment fibrillar collagens.
It is also believed to have a role in scar-
less  wound  healing53 by  enhancing
fibroblast  proliferation  and  survival.54
Gelatinases  are  another  class  of  MMPs
and  consist  of  two  types  of  enzymes,
gelatinase  A  (MMP-2)  and  gelatinase  B
(MMP-9), that are responsible for attack-
ing gelatin and collagen IV in the base-
ment  membrane.  Other  groups  of
MMPs  include  stromelysins,  which  are
mainly  involved  in  degradation  of  pro-
teoglycans,  laminins,  collagen  IV,  and
matrilysin,  which  is  expressed  on  stro-
mal tissue, fetal skin, and in the setting
of carcinomas.55

The activity of MMPs is regulated by
an endogenous tissue inhibitor of metal-
loproteinases  (TIMPs).  TIMPs  are  natu-
rally produced proteins that specifically
inhibit the MMPs. The balance between
MMPs  and  their  inhibition  by  TIMPs
leads  to  proper  tissue  remodeling.
TIMPs  are  regulated  via  expression  of
cytokines (such as IL-1), growth factors,
and  even  retinoids.56,57 Retinoids  have
been shown to provoke a two- to three-
fold  increase  in  the  biosynthesis  of
human  fibroblast-derived  TIMP 
in
vitro.58 Increased  production  of  MMPs
and  decreased  production  of  TIMPs
have a role in the metastatic behavior of
tumors.  Synthetic  inhibitors  of  MMPs
are  of  interest  to  researchers  especially
in  the  area  of  cancer  research.  These
inhibitors,  such  as  hydroxamates,  con-
tain a zinc-chelating group that binds to
the  active  site  of  MMPs  leading  to  its
inhibition. Currently, their use is mostly
limited  to  research  studies  because  of
their side-effect profile. Certain medica-
tions  such  as  doxycycline  are  also

known  for  their  inhibitory  effect  on
MMPs and have been studied in myriad
MMP-related  conditions  such  as  perio-
dontal and atherosclerotic diseases.

HYPODERMIS

The  hypodermis,  or  subcutis,  located
beneath the dermis, is composed mostly
of  fat,  which  is  an  important  energy
source for the body. This layer also con-
tains  collagen  types  I,  III,  and  V.  As
humans age, some of the subcutaneous
fat is lost or redistributed into undesired
areas.  This  phenomenon  contributes  to
the aged appearance. Fat injections have
been employed to move fat from unde-
sired areas into desired areas where fat
has been lost, such as the lower face (see
Chapter 23).

The  adipocytes  secrete  a  hormone
called  leptin,  a  product  of  the  obesity
(ob)  gene.  Leptin  exhibits  a  regulatory
effect  on  human  metabolism  and
appetite  and  therefore  affects  adipose
tissue  mass.  Leptin  has  been  shown  to
be higher in the serum of obese patients,
with  commensurate  levels  found  in
body fat percentage.59 It is believed that
a higher percentage of body fat results in
elevated leptin levels and the turning off
of signals to the brain for appetite reduc-
tion.  Recombinant  leptin  injections  in
mice  have  been  associated  with  reduc-
tion  of  weight  and  body  fat  percent-
age.60 However, more research is needed
to ascertain the therapeutic potential of
leptin in humans.

SUMMARY 

Although  the  epidermis  is  the  target  of
most topical cosmetic products because
most do not penetrate to the dermis, the
dermis  is  the  target  for  many  of  the
injectable treatments for aging. The der-
mis  is  an  extremely  important  compo-
nent  in  skin  appearance  because  it  is
responsible for imparting thickness and
suppleness to the skin. A thinner dermis
and an altered DEJ are hallmarks of aged
skin. Loss of collagen, elastin, and GAGs
located primarily in the dermis contribute
significantly to cutaneous aging. Various
measures  intended  to  prevent  or  retard
aging  target  these  key  constituents  of
the dermis.

Fat and the
Subcutaneous Layer

Voraphol Vejjabhinanta, MD

Leslie Baumann, MD

Subcutaneous  tissue,  or  the  hypoder-
mis, is one of the largest tissues in the
human body. The major components of
this layer are adipocytes, fibrous tissue,
and  blood  vessels.  It  is  estimated  that
this  layer  represents  9%  to  18%  of
body  weight  in  normal-weight  men
and 14% to 20% in women of normal
weight.1 Fat  mass  can  increase  up  to
four fold in severe obesity, which may
represent  60%  to  70%  of  total  body
weight.2 Although  gaining  fat  in  the
body is undesirable for many, losing fat
in the face has cosmetic implications as
well.  Adipose  tissue  gain  and  loss  and
volume changes contribute to the aged
appearance  of  the  face  and  body.  This
chapter  will  review  the  importance  of
the subcutaneous tissue and its various
functions.

The subcutaneous tissue is usually not
given  as  much  attention  as  the  dermis
and  epidermis  because  pathology  at
superficial  layers  is  easier  to  detect  or
diagnose  by  a  shave  or  small  punch
biopsy.  Subcutaneous  tissue  usually
must have an extensive defect before it is

BOX 3-1 Functions of the
Subcutaneous Tissue

• The largest repository of energy in the body.
• Stores fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K),

including their derivatives such as retinoic
acids.

• Helps to shape the surface of the body, and
form fat pads that act as shock absorbers.
• Helps distribute force or stress to mitigate

damage to underlying organs.

• Protects against physical injury from exces-
sive heat, cold, or mechanical factors.
• Fills up spaces between other tissues and

helps to keep organs in place.

• Involved in thermoregulation by insulating

the body from heat loss.

• Functions as a secretory organ that

releases many cytokines.

• Plays a role in regulating androgen and

estrogen levels.3

noticed, and in order to biopsy this area,
an incision or large punch biopsy (e.g., 6
mm) is required. During histologic tissue
processing  of  biopsy  tissue,  the  triglyc-
eride  component,  which  is  the  major
component of adipocytes, is removed by
alcohol and xylol. For this reason, subcu-
taneous  tissue  has  long  been  ignored.
However,  with  advances  in  diagnostic
methods  and  new  treatments,  much
more has been learned about the subcu-
taneous  layer  (Box  3-1).  It  is  important
for dermatologists and cosmetically ori-
ented  physicians  to  pay  close  attention
to  this  tissue  because  it  has  many  roles 
in  cosmetic  dermatology  and  general
appearance.

ADIPOCYTES

In  the  past,  adipocytes  in  adults  were
considered  stable,  nondividing  cells,
like other mature cells. However, recent
data  reveal  that  adipocytes  in  adults
have  the  potential  to  increase  in  num-
ber or revert back into stem cells. These
stem calls can differentiate to other tis-
sue, such as fibroblasts, collagen, elastic
fibers,  and  hematopoietic  stromal
cells.4 Fat cells are derived from undif-
ferentiated  fibroblast-like  mesenchy-
mal  cells.  Under  certain  conditions,
these  mesenchymal  cells  give  rise  to
adipose  cells.  Adipose  tissue  is  classi-
fied into two morphologic types: white
and  brown  adipose  tissue.  White  adi-
pose  tissue  normally  appears  yellow
because  of 
the  accumulation  of 
(cid:3)-carotene, while brown adipose tissue
was  named  by  its  appearance  derived
from  its  rich  vascular  supply.  Mature
white  adipocytes  are  called  round
unilocular  fat  cells.  They  have  a  copi-
ous  supply  of  cytoplasm,  which  con-
tains  a  single,  large  lipid  droplet  that
pushes the nucleus to the border of the
cell.  Brown  adipocytes,  called  polygo-
nal multilocular fat cells, have multiple
small lipid droplets.

When  observed  with  an  electron
microscope, brown adipocytes demon-
strably  contain  much  more  mitochon-
dria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum
than  white  adipocytes.  In  humans,
brown  adipocytes  play  a  major  role  in
nonshivering  thermogenesis.  Brown
adipose tissue can be found during the
fetal  and  early  neonatal  phases,  while
the majority of adipocytes in adults are
white adipocytes. Some scientists have
tried  to  elucidate  the  mechanism  of

how  brown  adipocytes  convert  fat  to
energy, in order to find a way to get rid
of body fat by stimulating brown fat to
return.5

In  the  past,  it  was  believed  that  the
number of adipocytes, which develop dur-
ing  the  30th  week  of  gestation,  does  not
increase  after  birth.  However,  newer
evidence  has  shown  that  adipocytes  can
increase  in  number  and  size  in  certain
situations  or  environments.  In  general,
adipocytes are thought to have two peri-
ods of growth. The first period occurs from
the  embryonic  stage  to  18  months  after
birth, and the second period occurs during
puberty.  Changes  in  adipose  tissue  mass
are determined by both size and number
of adipocytes.6 An increase in size (hyper-
trophy)7 usually precedes an increase in the
number of cells (hyperplasia).8

ANATOMY

Subcutaneous tissue, also known as the
superficial  fascia,  is  divided  into  three
layers:  apical,  mantle,  and  the  deeper
layer. The apical layer is located beneath
the  reticular  dermis  surrounding  sweat
glands  and  hair  follicles.  It  contains
blood  vessels,  lymphatic  vessels,  and
nerves. It is also rich in carotenoids and
tends to be yellow in gross appearance.
Damage  to  this  layer  can  lead  to
hematoma, seroma, paresthesia, and full
thickness  skin  necrosis.  The  mantle
layer  is  composed  of  columnar-shaped
adipocytes  and  is  absent  from  eyelids,
nail beds, bridge of the nose, and penis.
It  contributes  to  the  ability  to  resist
trauma by distributing pressure across a
large  field.  The  deeper  layer  is  located
under  the  mantle  layer  and  its  shape
depends  on  gender,  genetics,  anatomic
area,  and  diet.  Adipocytes  in  this  layer
are arranged in lobules between septa as
well  as  between  fibrous  planes.  This
layer is suitable for liposuction. Vertical
extrusion and/or expansion of this layer
can cause cellulite (Fig. 3-1).

Subcutaneous tissue is found through-
out the body except for the eyelids, prox-
imal  nail  fold,  penis,  scrotum,  and  the
entire  auricle  of  the  external  ear  except
the lobule. In particular, subcutaneous tis-
sue is prominent at the temples, cheeks,
chin,  nose,  abdomen,  buttocks,  and
thighs,  as  well  as  infraorbital  areas  and
very  thick  at  the  palms  and  soles.  Age,
gender,  and  lifestyle  choices  determine
the  distribution  and  density  of  adipose
deposits.  For  example,  in  newborns

This can lead to prominent flattening of
the  cheek/buccal  area,  sagging  of  the
skin  of  the  face,  and  prominent  deep
wrinkles,  such  as  nasolabial  folds  and
marionette lines or jowls.

Role of Lipids in the Human Body

Lipids  can  be  found  in  different  areas 
of  the  skin,  not  only  in  subcutaneous
tissue.  Lipids  are  constituents  of  phos-
pholipids in the myelin sheaths of nerve
tissue  and  cell  membranes  (lipid  bilay-
ers),  play  an  important  role  in  the  skin
barrier of the epidermis, and are essen-
tial for the production of steroids. They
are  water-insoluble  organic  molecules
because  they  are  nonpolar.  However,
after esterification (a condensation reac-
tion between acid and alcohol), they are
more  water-soluble  than  their  parent
forms.

The  most  common  lipids  in  the  diet
are triglycerides (triacylglycerol), which
are  composed  of  a  glycerol  subunit
attached  to  three  fatty  acids  (Fig.  3-3).
Lipids  can  be  saturated  or  unsaturated.
Generally, an unsaturated fatty acid con-
tains at least one double bond while sat-
urated  fatty  acids  do  not.  Unsaturated
fatty  acids  provide  slightly  less  energy
during  metabolism  than  saturated  fatty
acids  with  the  same  number  of  carbon
atoms. In addition, saturated fatty acids
are  usually  solids  at  room  temperature

adipose  tissue  has  a  uniform  thickness
throughout the body, while in adults the
tissue tends to disappear from some areas
of  the  body  and  increase  in  other  areas
under the influence of hormones.

Adipose  tissue  is  distributed  differ-
ently in men and women. Men tend to
accumulate  fat  in  an  android  or  upper
abdominal  body  distribution  (apple
shape). In contrast, women tend to accu-
mulate fat in a gynoid or lower body dis-
tribution  that  predominantly  involves
the  lower  abdomen,  hips,  and  thighs
(pear shape) (Fig. 3-2).

In the elderly, hyper- or hypoaccumu-
lation of fat occurs in various areas. For
example,  infraorbital  eye  bags,  buccal
fat  pad  accumulation  (chipmunk  fea-
ture), wattle of the anterior neck, loose
skin  and  fat  accumulation  in  the  pos-
terior  arm,  increase  in  breast  size  of
males, and an increase in abdomen, but-
fat  are  common.

and  unsaturated  fats  are  usually  liquids

Lipid Metabolism

During  digestion,  fats  in  the  food  are
broken down in the duodenum by pan-
creatic  lipase  into  free  fatty  acids  and
glycerol.  The 
intestinal  epithelium
absorbs these substances and reesterifies
them in the smooth endoplasmic reticu-
lum  into  triglycerides.  These  triglyc-
erides are then absorbed into the circula-
tion and lymphatic system. When they
arrive  in  the  circulation  they  are  com-
bined  with  apoprotein  to  form  a
lipoprotein,  which  is  called  a  chylomi-
cron.  Chylomicrons  are  exposed  to
lipoprotein lipase, which is synthesized
by adipocytes and stored at the surface
of  endothelial  cells.  Lipoprotein  lipase
cleaves  the  chylomicron  into  free  fatty
acids and glycerol again. These free fatty
acids pass into adipocytes and combine
with intracellular glycerol phosphate to
form  triglycerides  and  are  stored  for
energy.

Adipose tissue can also convert exces-
sive  glucose  and  amino  acids  into  fatty
acids  when  stimulated  by  insulin.  This
explains  why  people  who  consume  a
low-fat  diet  or  fat-free  diet  still  gain
weight  if  they  do  not  reduce  the  total
amount of calories they consume or have
a high-carbohydrate diet. High blood glu-
cose  can  stimulate  insulin  synthesis  and
insulin can increase synthesis of lipopro-
tein  lipase  from  adipocytes  to  help
absorb triglycerides into the cells. People
who want to control their weight should
avoid any foods that have the ability to
stimulate insulin production. Individuals
with type II diabetes have high levels of
insulin; therefore, they have a higher risk
of  becoming  overweight  or  obese  than
nondiabetic individuals.

(LDL) brings fat to the cells, while high-
density  lipoprotein  (HDL)  brings  fat
from  the  circulation  to  the  liver  for
excretion in bile. High levels of LDL are
associated with a high incidence of coro-
nary  artery  disease  and  atherosclerosis.
HDL, or the “good lipoprotein,” can be
elevated with exercise.

Lipid Synthesis

Triglycerides are derived from foods or
synthesized  from  excessive  glucose  or
amino  acids.  In  humans,  triglycerides
are  stored  mainly  in  adipose  tissue,
which  constitutes  the  body’s  reserve
energy source. However, excessive con-
sumption of calories can lead to the syn-
thesis  and  accumulation  of  more  fat  in
subcutaneous tissues. Unfortunately, fat
storage is unlimited in the subcutaneous
tissue,  unlike  glycogen  storage  in  the
liver  and  muscle.  Therefore,  excessive
fat accumulation will not only change a
person’s  cosmetic  appearance  but  also
increase their risk for osteoarthritis, dia-
betes,  hypertension,  as  well  as  other
diseases.

VOLUME EXCESS

Obesity

Obesity  is  defined  as  unhealthy,  exces-
sive fat mass. There are many regimens,
products,  and  exercise  programs  avail-
able; however, there is still a rising pan-
demic  in  the  United  States9 when 
compared  to  the  past.10 Obesity  and
hyperlipidemia  are  major  risk  factors
and  can  lead  to  significant  morbidity
and mortality.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Obesity  results  from
both environmental and genetic factors.
Two  genes  that  are  known  to  have
direct  effects  on  obesity  are  the  leptin
(ob  gene)11,12 and  proopiomelanocortin
(POMC)  genes.13 These  genes  can  con-
trol eating behavior and satiety. Defects
in these genes can cause severe obesity.

However, almost all people gain weight
when  they  get  older  because  of  dimin-
ished  physical  activity  and  aging-
induced changes in the chemical activity
of hormones. 

Body mass index [BMI: body weight
divided by the square of height (kg/m2)]
is a popular index used for determining
body  weight  status.  The  Centers  for
Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)
and World Health Organization (WHO)
use this index to classify adults into four
groups (Table 3-1).

A  normal  BMI  does  not  necessarily
mean  that  a  person  has  a  “perfect”
shape.  Many  people  with  a  BMI  less
than  25  have  fat  accumulation  in  some
area, such as the abdomen or buttocks.

IMPACT OF OBESITY ON THE SKIN Obesity
is responsible for changes in skin barrier
function  by  significantly  increasing
transepidermal  water  loss,  which  can
lead  to  dry  skin  and  impaired  barrier
function.14 Hyperfunction  of  sebaceous
glands  due  to  high  levels  of  androgen-
like hormone or insulin-like growth fac-
tor  hormone  can  aggravate  severity  of
acne  and  hirsutism;15,16 delay  wound
healing  and  collagen  deposits  in  the
wound  healing  process;17 and  disturb
both  blood  and  lymphatic  circulation,
which  can  cause  angiopathy18 and
lymphedema,  potentially  precipitating
chronic  leg  ulcers.19 Rapid  weight  gain
can cause striae distensae (stretch marks),
which  are  challenging  to  treat.20–23 In
addition, in intertriginous areas such as
the underarms, breasts, and groin, mois-
ture  accumulation  can  lead  to  candida
infection (intertrigo).

It  is  widely  known  that  obesity
increases the risk of coronary heart dis-
ease,  hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,
osteoarthritis,  and  diabetes.  It  is  also
known to be directly related to increased
risk of sleep apnea; breast, endometrial,
and  colon  cancer;  gallbladder  disease;
musculoskeletal  disorders;  severe  pan-
creatitis  and  diverticulitis;  infertility;

obesity  has  indirectly  been  related  to
anxiety, impaired social interaction, and
depression.

Obesity is implicated in a wide spec-
trum of dermatologic diseases, including
acanthosis  nigricans,  acrochordons,
keratosis pilaris, hyperandrogenism and
hirsutism,  striae  distensae,  adiposis
dolorosa, fat redistribution, lymphedema,
chronic  venous  insufficiency,  plantar
hyperkeratosis, cellulitis, skin infections,
hidradenitis  suppurativa,  psoriasis,  in-
sulin  resistance  syndrome,  and  topha-
ceous gout.24

To  determine  the  severity  of  a  per-
son’s obesity, BMI can be used. In fact,
the  more  overweight  a  person  is  the
higher the mortality rate (Table 3-2).

is  very
important  in  the  treatment  of  obesity.
Patients must understand the principle of
energy  intake  and  expenditure.  Weight
reduction  is  usually  not  accomplished
without  exercise.  However,  exercise
alone will usually produce little long-term
benefit. The combination of exercise with
dietary therapy can prevent weight being
regained. In addition, regular exercise (30
min  daily)  will  improve  general  health.
The best results are obtained with educa-
tion in well-motivated patients. Constant
supervision  by  healthcare  professionals
and  by  family  or  friends  can  help  to
encourage compliance.

PREVENTION Prevention of obesity is key
because  once  fat  is  gained  and  main-
tained  over  time,  it  is  more  difficult  to
lose.  A  high-fat  diet  can  induce  an
increase in the number of adipocytes.25,26
A  low-fat  and  complex  carbohydrate
diet  is  recommended  to  reduce  body
weight. There is an important difference
between  preventing  weight  gain  and
producing  weight  loss.  To  prevent
weight gain, portion size and composi-
tion  of  food  are  controlled.  For  weight
loss,  restriction  of  calorie  intake  is  the
most effective treatment.

Liposuction

Overweight  patients  frequently  consult
plastic  surgeons  and  dermatologists  for
liposuction.27–29 Liposuction  is  one  of
the  most  commonly  performed  cos-
metic surgery procedures in the United
States.30 Physicians  must  inform  their
patients  that  liposuction  is  a  modality
for improving body contour and not for
treatment  of  generalized  obesity.  In
addition, excess fatty tissue will return if
regular exercise and diet control are not
maintained.

Large-volume liposuction may decrease
weight  and  fat  mass;  however,  there  is
controversy  regarding  whether  or  not  it
significantly  improves  insulin  resistance
and  other  obesity-associated  metabolic
abnormalities.31–33 The  most  common
areas  treated  are  the  neck,  jowls,  arms,
abdomen,  thighs,  knees,  and  ankles.
Other conditions that can be improved by
liposuction include lipoma, gynecomastia,
buffalo hump, and axillary hyperhidrosis.
There  are  strict  guidelines  from  both
the  American  Society  of  Dermatologic
(ASDS)  and  the  American
Surgery 
Academy  of  Cosmetic  Surgery  (AACS)
on the volume restrictions during liposuc-
tion. Tumescent liposuction is considered
the safest method for performing the pro-

cedure. This technique relies on the infil-
tration  of  dilute  anesthesia  based  on
body weight, and the removal of limited
amounts  of  adipose  tissue  during  each
operation. Tumescent anesthesia consists
of very dilute lidocaine and epinephrine
solutions ranging from 0.05% to 0.1% of
lidocaine  with  1:1,000,000  epinephrine
and  sodium  bicarbonate.  The  total  safe
concentration  of  lidocaine  that  can  be
used  in  this  formula  is  35  to  55  mg/kg
based on patient weight and any coexist-
ing medical conditions. Table 3-3 is a syn-
opsis of the 2006 ASDS guidelines of care
for tumescent liposuction.28

LIPOSUCTION COMPLICATIONS While there
have been reports of mortality with gen-
eral  anesthesia,  there  have  been  no
reports  of  death  with  tumescent  anes-
thesia alone. When practitioners adhere
to  the  AACS  and  ASDS  guidelines,
tumescent  liposuction  is  a  safe  outpa-
tient procedure. Common complications
are  bruising,  swelling,  localized  pares-
thesia,  and  irritated  incision  sites  after
liposuction. Other complications include
hematomas,  seromas,  and  infection.
There are serious complications that the
surgeon  must  be  aware  of,  however,
such as the development of a fat embolus,

visceral  perforation,  pneumothorax,
deep  vein  thrombosis,  congestive  heart
failure,  and  lidocaine  toxicity.  Fortu-
nately, these complications are very rare
during  tumescent  liposuction.  The  rela-
tive  skills  and  experience  level  of  the
operating physician represent important
contributing  factors  to  the  incidence  of
adverse events from liposuction.

Careful patient selection is the key to
a successful outcome. Younger patients,
those  with  good  skin  tone,  and  those
close to their ideal weight tend to be the
best  candidates.  Poor  patient  selection
may lead to the development of rippling
or poor skin contraction.

VOLUME LOSS

Normal Aging

The  aging  face  shows  characteristic
changes,  many  of  which  were  once
solely attributed to the effects of gravity
on skin, muscle, and fat. It is for this rea-
son that the main approach to the aging
face  was  to  lift  and  reposition  “ptotic”
tissue. However, we now recognize that
there  are  complex  changes  occurring  in
which  volume  loss  is  a  significant  con-
tributor.  These  changes  include  muscle
atrophy,  bone  resorption,  and  fat  atro-
phy. There are some well-designed stud-
ies that look at the bony changes of the
face and the change in the malar fat pad
with  time.  The  results  of  these  studies
show  that  the  lower  midfacial  skeleton
becomes  retrusive  with  age  relative  to
the upper face.34 Study authors speculate
that the skeletal remodeling of the ante-
rior maxillary wall allows soft tissues to
be  repositioned  downward  thereby
accentuating the nasojugal fold and malar
mound. In a different study, some of the
same  authors  describe  the  increasing
incidence  of  a  “negative  vector  face”  as
one ages.35 A “negative-vector” patient is
one  in  whom  the  bulk  of  the  malar  fat
pads lies posterior to a line drawn straight
down from the cornea to the orbital rim.
With  this  change,  the  lower  eyelid  fat
pads appear more prominent but are not
truly hypertrophied.

In  a  magnetic  resonance  imaging
(MRI) study by Gosain et al. the deep-
ening appearance of the nasolabial fold
with age seems to be a combination of
ptosis  and  fat/skin  hypertrophy.36
They found a difference in the redistri-
bution  of  fat  within  the  malar  fat  pad
by age, with older women exhibiting a
relatively  increased  thickness  of  the
midportion  of  the  malar  fat  pad  and
overlying  skin  compared  to  younger
females.  More  interestingly,  they  did

not  find  an  increase  in  the  length  or
projection  of  the  levator  labii  superi-
oris  muscle  between  young  and  old
subjects. 

A  more  recent  cadaveric  study  con-
sidered the fat distribution of the face.37
The  authors  found  distinct  facial  fat
compartments  and  subdivisions  within
these  areas.  The  malar  fat  pad  is  com-
posed  of  three  separate  compartments:
medial,  middle,  and  lateral  temporal–
cheek  fat.  The  nasolabial  fold  was  uni-
formly  a  discrete  unit  with  distinct
anatomic boundaries and little variation
in  size  from  one  cadaver  to  the  next.
The  forehead  also  consisted  of  three
anatomic units: central, middle, and lat-
eral  temporal–cheek  fat.  Orbital  fat  is
noted  in  three  compartments  deter-
mined  by  septal  borders.  However,  the
superior  orbital  fat  did  not  connect  to
the inferior orbital fat. The jowl fat is the
most  inferior  of  the  subcutaneous  fat
compartments  and  was  found  to  be
closely  associated  with  the  depressor
anguli oris muscle.

One  of  the  easiest  ways  for  a  cos-
metic  surgeon  to  begin  to  understand
these changes in patients is by evaluat-
ing  photographs  of  the  patient  both  in
youth and at the time of presentation for
a  consultation.  This  can  be  seen  in  the
works of surgeons that have performed
a great deal of volume restoration surg-
eries over the years.38,39

Autologous Fat Transplantation

Fat  transplantation  is  the  reinjection  of
aspirated adipocytes into an area that has
lost  volume  as  a  result  of  aging,  trauma, 
or  after  an 
inflammatory  process.
Autologous fat transplantation offers cer-
tain  advantages  over  other  fillers,  most
notably  that  it  is  an  autograft  with  the
same human leukocyte antigen therefore
there is no allergic reaction or rejection via
immune  processes.  Indications  for  fat
transfer are volume loss anywhere in the
face  such  as  the  nasolabial  folds,  lips,
under  eye  hollow  and  tear  trough  defor-
mity,  submalar  depressions,  zygoma
enhancement,  chin  augmentation,  malar
augmentation,  congenital  and  traumatic
defects, surgical defects, wide-based acne
scarring,  idiopathic  lipodystrophy,  facial
hemiatrophy, rejuvenation of hands, body
contour  defects,  depressions  caused  by
liposuction or trauma, etc.35,40,41 This tech-
nique can be divided into two processes:
harvesting  fat  from  the  donor  site,  and
reinjecting  it  into  the  recipient  sites.  The
medical literature is replete with different
techniques by which fat is harvested, pre-
pared, and infiltrated into the tissue. The

variation  in  these  techniques  probably
accounts for why some surgeons find suc-
cess with this modality and others do not
achieve long-lasting results.42

Factors  that  influence  survival  of  fat
after  injection  include  the  anatomic
sites  of  harvesting  and  placement,  the
degree of mobility in the recipient area,
the  vascularity  of  the  recipient  tissue,
and  the  overall  health  and  age  of  the
patient.43

We found that fat aspirated from the
lateral  thigh  lasts  longer  than  fat  taken
from  the  abdomen.  Even  during  har-
vesting, one will find a noticeable differ-
ence  in  the  quality  of  the  fat  between
the  two  areas.  The  fat  of  the  upper
arms, inner thighs, and abdomen tends
to be softer and contain less connective
tissue. Fat from the lateral thigh tends to
be  more  dense  and  fibrous.  Further-
more, placement of the fat into the tis-
sues  is  critical  to  ensure  viability.
Adipocytes require a healthy and vascu-
lar bed in which to engraft. For this rea-
son, fat must be placed in small parcels
and in multiple layers, including in and
under  muscles.  The  less  movement  in
the recipient site, the more that fat sur-
vives. Therefore, the malar and infraor-
bital areas do well while the nasolabial
folds  and  lips  require  touch-ups  to
achieve the desired effect.

Complications

Complications  are  rare  but  include
swelling,  ecchymosis,  hematoma,  and
infection. Known cases of blindness and
cerebral strokes resulting after fat trans-
plantation  at  the  glabella44–46 and
paranasal  areas47 have  been  noted.  In
these  cases,  a  sharp  needle  or  large
syringe  were  used  to  inject  the  fat.  By
using  only  blunt  cannulas  and  1  mL
syringes, this complication has not been
reported in the literature.

Fat Cells as a Source for Stem Cells
and Collagen Stimulation

There is evidence that supports the util-
ity of adipocytes for a potential stem cell
role as well as collagen stimulation. First,
it  is  known  that  even  after  puberty  the
human  body  can  increase  the  number
and  size  of  fat  cells.  Second,  subcuta-
neous tissue contains not only adipocytes
but also fibrous tissue and blood vessels.
These tissues are active cells and can pro-
liferate when there is an increase in the
size  of  subcutaneous  tissue.48 In  addi-
tion,  there  is  evidence  demonstrating
that  aspirated  fluid  from  liposuction
contains  cells  that  can  differentiate  into

bone,  cartilage,  muscle,  neurons,  and

In  contrast  to  harvesting  stem  cells
from  the  bone  marrow,  harvesting
adipocytes  from  subcutaneous  tissue  is
much  easier  and  complications  at  the
donor  site  can  easily  be  visualized.  In
addition,  adipocytes  can  be  harvested
from  many  areas  and  multiple  times.
Harvesting stem cells from fat will be an
interesting  topic  in  the  future  for  tissue
reengineering. 

One  intriguing  observation  noted
both by the senior author (Suzan Obagi)
and  in  her  communications  with  other
surgeons  that  frequently  perform  fat
transfers is that the skin of patients con-
tinues to improve and show a reduction
in  rhytides  and  aging  symptoms  over
time after autologous fat augmentation.
This improvement is not seen in patients
receiving synthetic fillers. This leads one
to question whether the stems cells play
a beneficial role in the skin.

MISCELLANEOUS ADIPOSE
CONDITIONS

Cellulite

Cellulite occurs mainly in postadolescent
women  at  the  buttocks,  abdomen,  and
thighs. Risk factors include lack of exer-
cise;  being  female,  overweight/obese,
elderly, and having excess hormones and
poor lymphatic drainage. It is character-
ized  by  dimpling  and  nodularity  of  the
skin, where the skin looks and feels irreg-
ular, almost like an orange peel (Box 3-2).
Cellulite  largely  results  from  changes  in
the dermis rather than changes in subcu-
taneous  tissue.  Although  cellulite  is  fre-
quently  found  in  healthy,  nonobese
patients, it is aggravated by obesity.53–55

PATHOGENESIS The pathophysiology of
cellulite  is  not  completely  understood,
but many theories for the pathogenesis
of  cellulite  have  been  postulated.  One

BOX 3-2 Hexsel Classiﬁcation of
Cellulitea

• At Stage 0, the skin’s surface is not altered.
• At Stage I, skin is smooth when the indi-

vidual is standing or lying down, but some
cellulite appears if the skin is pinched.
• At Stage II, skin appears dimpled without

any pinching or manipulation.

• At Stage III, skin appears both dimpled

and raised in some areas.

aPersonal communication with Doris Hexsel,
Porto Allegre, Brazil.

of  the  most  important  factors  is  the
anatomy  of  this  condition.  There  are
morphologic differences of the fat lobes
between  males  and  females,  which
may explain the large frequency of cel-
lulite in females and rare occurrence in
males. Cellulite is thought to be formed
from the breakdown of collagen in the
reticular dermis, which leads to weak-
ness  in  the  dermis  and  herniation  of
subcutaneous  fat  into  the  dermis,  as
well as compression of the microcircu-
lation  of  the  dermis.  Congestion  of
fluid  and  protein  in  the  dermis  is
believed to lead to formation of fibrotic
bands between the subcutaneous tissue
and dermis resulting in retraction, dim-
pling, or nodularity.

TREATMENT This condition is considered
normal in postadolescent women and is
innocuous.  Many  people  feel  that  it  is
cosmetically  unappealing  both  visually
and  tactilely.  This  condition  may  not
improve by weight reduction; however,
weight control may improve the appear-
ance of cellulite in some patients.

There  are  many  modalities  that  pro-
pose to treat this condition by stimula-
tion  of  collagen  production  in  the  der-
mis,  such  as  infrared,  diode  laser,  and
radiofrequency.56 These  methods  are
new and the efficacy is unknown at this
point.  The  most  effective  method  to
treat  cellulite  is  to  improve  blood  and
lymphatic  circulation  and  drainage  of
waste products with massage; however,
the  effects  are  temporary.  Efforts  to
increase  exercise  can  stimulate  lymph
flow and decrease fluid accumulation. A
decrease  in  fat  mass  can  also  occur  by
lipolysis, such as with exercise and diet,
liposuction, ultrasound-assisted lipolysis
and  mesotherapy.  In  severe  dimpling
lesions,  minimally  invasive  procedures
such  as  subcision  can  lead  to  improve-
ment.57 Many topical products claim to
treat  cellulite.  The  most  effective  of
these contain caffeine and theophylline,
which dehydrate the fat cells, temporar-
ily  shrinking  them.  Despite  the  many
cellulite treatments on the market, none
have  been  shown  to  be  convincingly
effective for more than 24 hours.

Lipodystrophy

Lipodystrophy  is  a  term  describing
abnormality  with  increasing  subcuta-
neous  fat  (lipohypertrophy)  or  decreas-
ing  subcutaneous  fat  (lipoatrophy).  It
can be congenital or acquired, and gen-
eralized,  partial,  or  localized.  The  two
most  common  forms  of  lipodystrophy
include  lipodystrophy  due  to  the  aging

process  and  HIV-associated  lipodystro-
phy.  Aging  skin  is  characterized  by  a
loss of subcutaneous tissue and laxity of
the  anterior  supporting  dermis.  A
decrease  in  supporting  bone  mass  and
loss of muscle tone can cause patients to
look older. In HIV-associated lipodystro-
phy,  most  patients  are  treated  with
highly  active  antiretroviral  therapy
(HAART).  This  combination  therapy
contains  nonnucleoside  reverse  tran-
scriptase inhibitors that can hinder DNA
polymerase  leading  to  adipocyte  apop-
tosis.

Common  areas  affected  by  lipodys-
trophy are the cheeks, forehead, tempo-
ral,  infraorbital,  and  jowl  fat  compart-
ments.  Losing  fat  in  some  areas  can
affect  the  general  appearance  in  other
areas. For example, decreasing subcuta-
neous fat in the malar cheeks can cause a
prominent nasolabial fold, or decreasing
jowl fat can cause prominent marionette
lines  and  jowls.  Treatment  can  be  per-
formed  by  using  synthetic  filler  agents
or  autologous 
transplantation.
fat 
However,  many  HIV  patients  lack  ade-
quate fat for aspiration and transplanta-
tion  or  their  fat  is  very  fibrous,  which
makes  harvesting  difficult.  Polylactic
acid  (Sculptra™,  Dermik  Laboratories,
Berwyn,  Pennsylvania),  FDA-approved
for the treatment of facial lipoatrophy in
HIV  patients,  is  a  very  useful  product
that works by stimulating collagen syn-
thesis.  The  more  recent  use  of  higher
dilutions and longer reconstitution times
has led to a decrease in the formation of
granulomas after injection of this agent
(see Chapter 25).

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Understanding the biology of adipocytes
is important to the progress of lipolysis
techniques  and  the  possible  usage  of
adipocytes  as  stem  cells.  In  addition,
various  methods  for  fat  removal  are
being  investigated,  including  drugs 
or chemicals that can stimulate lipoly-
sis  (e.g.,  phosphatedylcholine,  isopro-
terenal,  theophylline,  aminophylline,
caffeine, carnitine, carbon dioxide, and
herbal  extracts)  and  device-assisted
liposuction such as ultrasound (to burst
fat  cells)  or  1064  nm  Nd:YAG  laser  (to
melt  the  fat  cell).  These  new  methods
need  to  be  evaluated  for  safety  and
efficacy.

SUMMARY

Adipocytes  and  subcutaneous  tissue
are  important  subjects  to  which  the 

19

 
 
 
 
 
cosmetic  dermatologist  should  pay
attention. There are cosmetic concerns
related  to  both  excess  and  loss  of  fat
for  which  the  patient  will  seek  cos-
metic  intervention.  Advances  in  this
field will be centered on more directed
therapies  of  fat  removal  or  disruption
in  heavy  patients  and  on  stem  cell
purification  and  injection  in  thinner
patients.  It  is  the  role  of  the  cosmetic
dermatologist  to  remain  abreast  of
these  changes.  Furthermore,  cosmetic
dermatologists  and  surgeons  should
take  an  active  role  in  counseling
patients  on  proper  nutrition  and
weight  management 
from  both
extremes (too thin or too heavy).

Immunology of 
the Skin

H. Ray Jalian, MD
Jenny Kim, MD, PhD

Little  is  known  about  the  relationship
between  immunology  and  skin  appear-
ance;  however,  it  is  certain  that  the
immune system plays an important role
in the health of the skin. Work is ongoing
to  help  elucidate  how  this  vital  system
interacts  with  the  largest  organ  of  the
body. It is very likely that this segment of
research,  as  it  pertains  to  the  cosmetic
dermatology arena, will offer significant
potential for discovery of new therapeu-
tics  and  procedures  in  the  next  several
years.  This  chapter  will  serve  as  a  brief
introduction  to  the  skin  as  an  immune
organ  and  how  the  immune  response
plays a role in cosmetic dermatology.

In the past, the skin was viewed pri-
marily  as  a  barrier  mechanism  to
prevent  invading  pathogens  and  other
environmental  toxins,  including  UV
radiation, from penetrating into internal
organs.  However,  we  now  know  that
the skin essentially acts as an immense
and  integral  immune  organ  and  first
point of contact with the environment,
capable of initiating an intricate series of
events  leading  to  host  defense.  A  basic
review  of  skin  immunology,  including
the role of cytokines and growth factors,
will be provided as an important part of
this  discussion.  Mechanisms  of  various
immune  responses  found  in  skin  dis-
ease,  the  interplay  between  innate
immunity  and  extracellular  matrix  syn-
thesis,  as  well  as  emerging  immune-
based  treatments  will  also  be  high-
lighted. Finally, the relevance of the local
immune  system  and  its  relationship  to
skin aging, particularly photoaging, will
be briefly reviewed.

SKIN—AN INNATE IMMUNE
ORGAN

The  immune  response  can  be  divided
into  innate  and  adaptive  immunity.
Innate immune response occurs rapidly
and  the  cells  of  the  innate  immune
system use pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs)  to  secrete  soluble  factors  that 
can  lead  to  both  inflammation  and 
host  defense.  The  adaptive  immune

response,  on  the  other  hand,  occurs
slowly  and  activation  of  adaptive
immune  cells,  such  as  B  and  T  cells,
requires  that  receptors  undergo  gene
rearrangements.  The  adaptive  immune
system  can  mount  either  humoral
immunity (B cells, which make antibod-
ies) or cell-mediated immunity (T cells).
Furthermore, the adaptive immune sys-
tem  is  also  responsible  for  immune
memory,  which  confers  long-term  pro-
tection  to  the  host.  Although  the  two
systems  appear  distinct,  they  are  not
separate,  and  in  fact  can  act  synergisti-
cally, insofar as the innate immune sys-
tem  instructs  the  adaptive  immune
response and the adaptive immune sys-
tem influences the innate system.

In the epidermis, the two main innate
cells are the keratinocytes and Langerhans
cells.  In  addition,  neutrophils,  macro-
phages, and dendritic cells present within
the  dermis  also  play  a  role  in  innate
immunity.  When  a  foreign  substance  is
encountered,  activation  of  innate  cells
occurs through PRRs, including the Toll-
like receptors (TLRs), which are reviewed
below.  Upon  activation,  the  innate  cells
become  capable  of  inducing  a  direct
antimicrobial response by producing fac-
tors that can help protect the host from
external  insults.  These  factors  include
reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermedi-
ates  (also  known  as  “free  radicals”)  and
antimicrobial  peptides.  In  addition,  acti-

vated innate cells produce cytokines and
other  inflammatory  mediators  that  can
instruct adaptive immunity. Paradoxically,
the  same  innate  immune  response  can
induce  proinflammatory  cytokine  pro-
duction  that  can  lead  to  inflammation
and tissue injury, thereby facilitating dis-
ease pathology.

Cytokines and Growth Factors

Cytokines  are  soluble  mediators  of  the
immune  system  secreted  by  particular
cell  types  in  response  to  a  variety  of
stimuli. They differ in molecular weight,
structure,  and  mechanism  of  action.  In
general, secreted cytokines act locally in
either  an  autocrine  (effect  on  the  pro-
ducing cell itself) or paracrine (effect on
adjacent cells) fashion. While there have
been  numerous  cytokines  identified  to
date, this section will focus on the com-
mon  cytokines  present  in  the  skin  and
the  changes  that  occur  in  expression
profiles with aging.

In  the  epidermis,  cytokines  are  pri-
marily  produced  by  keratinocytes,
melanocytes,  and  Langerhans  cells,
while fibroblasts, endothelial cells, mast
cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, lym-
phocytes,  and  other  inflammatory  cells
are responsible for cytokine production
within the dermis (Table 4-1 for a sum-
mary  of  cytokines  present  in  the  skin
and the cells that produce them).

PROINFLAMMATORY  CYTOKINES Activation
of  the  immune  system  is  an  important
step 
from
pathogens  and  other  environmental  tox-
ins; however, paradoxically, activation of
the immune mechanism can also lead to
inflammation,  thus  promoting  disease
and  aging.  Interleukin  (IL)-1,  a  cytokine
capable  of  being  expressed  by  virtually
any  nucleated  cells, 
including  ker-
atinocytes,  exhibits  a  broad  spectrum  of
biologic  activity.  Whereas  IL-1(cid:3) is  pre-
dominantly expressed in most cells, IL-1(cid:2)
is  expressed  by  keratinocytes.1
IL-1
induces  keratinocyte  proliferation,  pro-
motes differentiation of B cells, activates
neutrophils  and  macrophages,  and  initi-
ates the expression of other proinflamma-
tory cytokines. In addition, IL-1 is capable
of enhancing the activation of T cells, and
is  involved  in  aspects  of  both  humoral 
(B  cells)  and  cellular  immunity  (T  cells).
IL-1 is continuously expressed at low lev-
els  in  normal  epidermis  but  is  markedly
enhanced  when  the  skin  barrier  is  dis-
rupted. Furthermore, upon UV radiation,
keratinocytes can secrete IL-1, which then
initiates  a  cytokine  cascade  and  the  bio-
logic  sequelae  may  accelerate  changes
seen in photoaging.

factor 

Tumor  necrosis 

(TNF)-(cid:2),
although  structurally  unrelated  to  IL-1,
shares similar biologic spectra. TNF-(cid:2) is
a  potent  inducer  of  inflammation  and
also  induces  prostaglandin  synthesis  in
macrophages, further contributing to its
proinflammatory  nature.  Within  the
skin, both IL-1 and TNF-(cid:2) are expressed
by  keratinocytes  and  Langerhans  cells.
IL-6,  produced  by  keratinocytes,  Lan-
gerhans cells, and resident immune cells
within  the  skin,  synergizes  with  other
cytokines,  mainly  potentiating  the
effects of TNF-(cid:2) and IL-1.

Other  members  of  the  interleukin
family  are  expressed  by  various  cells
within  the  skin  and  contribute  to  local
innate  and  adaptive  immunity.  IL-2  is
secreted by activated T cells within the
skin and promotes clonal T cell prolifer-
ation  as  well  as  cytokine  production,
and is critical for activation of the adap-
tive  immune  response.  IL-4,  expressed
by  activated  T  cells,  mast  cells,  and
eosinophils,  is  important  in  allergic
disease  processes  and  has  been  shown
to  promote  IgE  production  and  the
maturation  of  mast  cells  and  eosin-
ophils.  IL-5,  expressed  by  monocytes
and  eosinophils,  serves  mainly  as  an
eosinophil  growth  and  differentiation
factor.  IL-8,  produced  by  keratinocytes
and  resident  immune  cells  within  the
skin,  is  a  potent  chemotractant  for
neutrophils. IL-12, produced by antigen

presenting  cells,  is  a  critical  regulator 
of  innate  and  adaptive  immunity,  and
serves  to  potentiate  cell-mediated  im-
munity.  It  is  also  expressed  by  ker-
atinocytes and Langerhans cells.

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY  CYTOKINES Not  all
members  of  the  interleukin  family  are
inhibits  the
proinflammatory.  IL-10 
inflammatory immune response through
various  mechanisms.  Specifically,  it  hin-
ders  antigen  presenting  cell  function  by
downregulating major histocompatibility
complex  (MHC)  class  II  expression.
Along with T cells, macrophages, and B
cells,  keratinocytes  express 
IL-10.
Moreover,  IL-10  disrupts  cytokine  pro-
duction  by  immune  effector  cells  and
inhibits the generation of reactive oxygen
species  (via  oxidative  burst)  and  nitric
oxide production. UV radiation enhances
IL-10 production in keratinocytes, which
can  lead  to  immune  dysregulation.2 In
addition, the production of IL-10 by non-
melanoma  skin  cancer  can  inhibit  the
function  of  tumor  infiltrating  lympho-
cytes  and  promote  tumor  growth.3
Interestingly,  the  immune  cells  of  older
individuals have been shown to produce
high  levels  of  IL-10  in  comparison  to
younger adults, suggesting that IL-10 is in
part responsible for the immunosuppres-
sion observed in the elderly.4

GROWTH  FACTORS Growth  factors  are
proteins  that  have  an  effect  on  cellular
proliferation  and  differentiation.  While

some cytokines can also be classified as
growth  factors,  not  all  cytokines  are
considered growth factors (seeTable 4-2
for  a  summary  of  the  functions  of
cytokines  and  growth  factors).  There
are  numerous  families  of  growth  fac-
tors. The epidermal growth factor (EGF)
family and the transforming growth fac-
tor  (TGF)-(cid:3) superfamilies  will  be  dis-
cussed further.

TGF-(cid:2) is a member of the EGF family
of growth factors, which also consists of
EGF, amphiregulin (AR), epiregulin, and
neuregulin 1, 2, and 3. These growth fac-
tors  are  secreted  by  keratinocytes  and
bind to the EGF receptor in an autocrine
manner to induce keratinocyte prolifera-
tion.5 In  addition  to  increasing  epider-
mal thickness and contributing in a com-
plex chain of events to the regulation of
keratinocyte  differentiation,  EGF  is
important  in  wound  healing.6 Notably,
EGF  and  TGF-(cid:2) enhance  migration  of
normal  keratinocytes.7 EGF  accelerates
wound  healing  in  mice  and  enhances
lateral  migration  of  keratinocytes,
wound  closure,  and  subsequent  reep-
ithelialization.8 Moreover,  EGF  stimu-
lates  fibroblast  migration  and  prolifera-
tion and is critical for wound repair and
dermal regeneration.9,10

Decreased  responsiveness  of  EGF
receptors  is  seen  with  increasing  age,
possibly because of a lower number and
density of receptors, as well as to reduced
ligand binding, receptor autophosphory-
lation,  and  internalization.11 In  addition,

amphiregulin  expression  is  downregu-
lated  in  aged  epidermis.12 Diminished
EGF  activity  and  amphiregulin  expres-
sion  lead  to  a  subsequent  decrease  in
fibroblast  migration  and  proliferation  at
the site of wound healing. These events
result in the impaired wound healing that
is observed in aged skin. Moreover, aged
fibroblasts produce fewer matrix compo-
nents,13 yielding less dermal tissue and a
thinner, weaker scar.

Many cosmeceuticals now contain var-
ious  growth  factors 
including  EGF,
insulin-like growth factor, platelet growth
factor,  and  keratinocyte  growth  factor.
Although these growth factors can theo-
retically  induce  keratinocyte  differentia-
tion and dermal remodeling, whether any
of  the  products  available  to  consumers
demonstrate significant clinical effective-
ness  in  preventing  or  reversing  photoag-
ing  has  not  yet  been  established.  Since
cosmeceuticals  are  not  subject  to  the
same  FDA  regulatory  requirements  as
drugs, well-controlled clinical studies that
support the efficacy of cosmeceuticals are
generally not available.

The  TGF-(cid:3) superfamily  has  a  broad
spectrum of functions dependent on the
dosage  and  the  target  cell  type.  In  the
wound  healing  process,  TGF-(cid:3) is
responsible  for  recruiting  monocytes,
neutrophils,  and  fibroblasts  to  the
wound  site.  Higher  concentrations  of
TGF-(cid:3) activate  monocytes  to  release
numerous growth factors and stimulate
fibroblasts  to  increase  matrix  synthesis
and decrease matrix degradation.14 The
effects  of  TGF-(cid:3) on  keratinocytes  are
inconclusive with some studies showing
an inhibitory role in growth, while oth-
ers  favoring  keratinocyte  chemoattrac-
tion  and  activation.  This  apparent  dis-
crepancy  is  perhaps  linked  to  the
temporal kinetics, dose of TGF-(cid:3) admin-
istered, and also the dual activity TGF-(cid:3)
exerts on keratinocytes.

TGF-(cid:3) is best known in cosmetic der-
matology  for  its  ability  to  promote  the
production  of  the  extracellular  matrix,
notably  the  synthesis  of  procollagen.15
TGF-(cid:3) also serves as a growth factor for
fibroblasts, the cells that produce collagen
and  play  an  important  role  in  wound
healing.14 The  subcutaneous  injection  of
TGF-(cid:3) into  unwounded  skin  results  in
increased collagen deposition at the injec-
tion site.16 Moreover, collagen synthesis is
enhanced in animal models when TGF-(cid:3)
is administered locally or systemically.17,18
Despite the encouraging results of TGF-(cid:3)
on collagen synthesis, its effects on reep-
ithelialization are less predictable. In vivo
studies have shown both accelerated and
impaired  reepithelialization  in  animal

wound models,19,20 echoing the contradic-
tory effects of TGF-(cid:3) on keratinocytes.

Loss  of  TGF-(cid:3) function  may  be 
significant  in  photoaging.  UV  radiation
impairs  the  TGF-(cid:3) pathway  via  down-
regulation  of  TGF-(cid:3) type  II  receptor
(TGF-(cid:3) RII).  Loss  of  TGF-(cid:3) RII  occurs
within 8 hours after irradiation and pre-
cedes the downregulation of type I pro-
collagen  expression,21 which  leads  to
reduced collagen production. Moreover,
UV exposure decreases the expression of
TGF-(cid:3), and upregulates Smad7, a nega-
tive  regulator  of  TGF.22 For  this  reason,
TGF-(cid:3) is included in skin care products.
Whether  the  TGF-(cid:3) and  other  growth
factors  contained  in  cosmeceuticals  are
stable,  can  be  absorbed  adequately,  or
exert  a  functionally  significant  outcome
to induce dermal remodeling and reverse
photoaging  is  unclear  since  well-con-
trolled clinical studies are lacking.

Cytokines and Aging

Although  the  molecular  mechanisms  of
photoaging and actinic damage have not
been  fully  elucidated,  skin-derived  cyto-
kines  are  likely  involved  in  this  process.
UV radiation exposure, which is thought
to  be  responsible  for  photoaging,  results
in inflammation, known as sunburn, and
increased  proinflammatory  cytokines  by
resident  skin  cells,  including  IL-1,  IL-6,
and  IL-8.  These  cytokines  cause  inflam-
mation, but also initiate activation of ker-
atinocytes,  macrophages,  and  other
immune cells that generate reactive oxy-
gen species, resulting in cellular damage.
In addition, these reactive oxygen species
initiate the production of activator protein
(AP)-1  and  the  formation  of  destructive
enzymes  such  as  collagenases  that  con-

UV  exposure  also  increases  the  pro-
duction  of  TGF-(cid:2) from  keratinocytes.24
In  addition,  UVB  irradiation  of  hairless
mice has been shown to elevate levels of
IL-1(cid:2),  and  TNF-(cid:2) mRNA  in  skin.25
Interestingly, UV-produced cytokines dis-
play  opposing  functions  with  regard  to
keratinocyte  proliferation.  UV  exposure
increases levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TGF-(cid:2),
which  are  known  to  augment  ker-
atinocyte  proliferation,  while  TNF-(cid:2) is
known to suppress keratinocyte growth.
Keratinocyte-  and  dermal-derived
cytokines that result from UV exposure
may also partially account for the dys-
pigmentation  seen  with  photoaging.
An  experimental  model  has  demon-
strated  that  UVA-induced  granulocyte
monocyte  colony  stimulating  factor
from  keratinocytes  may  play  a  role  in
melanocyte proliferation and thus result

in UVA-induced pigmentation in the epi-
dermis.26 Further  studies  are  needed  to
clarify the role of UV-induced cytokines
on melanocyte growth and function.

Toll-like Receptors

The  discovery  of  TLRs  has  created  a
new  paradigm  for  how  we  view  the
innate immune system. Moreover, TLRs
appear  to  play  important  roles  in  acne
and  other  inflammatory  skin  diseases.
Considering  the  partial  proinflamma-
tory  nature  of  UV-induced  photoaging,
it  is  possible  that  TLRs  factor  into  the
aging  process.  Because  TLRs  are  often
activated  early  in  the  innate  immune
response  resulting  in  cytokine  produc-
tion,  part  of  the  age-related  cytokine
aberration may be linked to changes in
TLR expression and function. The back-
ground of TLRs and their known roles in
skin disease and photoaging will be dis-
cussed  in  this  section.  In  addition,  the
effect  of  retinoids  on  TLR  expression
and function will be explored.

referred 

The  importance  of  innate  immunity
became clear with the discovery of TLRs
a decade ago. The toll receptor, initially
described in relation to drosophila, was
shown to be crucial in preventing fungal
infection  in  flies.  Subsequently,  it  was
demonstrated  that  TLRs  play  a  role  in
human  host  defense.27 To  date,  10
human  TLRs  have  been  described  and
their role in innate immunity has greatly
influenced our view on the immune sys-
tem. TLRs are PRRs capable of recogniz-
ing  a  variety  of  conserved  microbial
motifs  collectively 
to  as
pathogen-associated molecular patterns.
Each TLR recognizes a unique microbial
motif, such as bacterial cell wall compo-
nents,  fungal  elements,  viral  RNA,  and
bacterial  DNA.  Moreover,  individual
TLRs  can  form  dimers  in  order  to
increase specificity. A summary of TLRs
and their respective ligands can be found
in  Fig.  4-1.  Although  their  extracellular
domains  vary  in  specificity  for  their
respective  microbial  ligands,  the  intra-
cellular domains of TLRs are conserved
and converge onto a common pathway.
TLR  signaling  is  thought  to  occur  pri-
marily in a MyD88-dependent pathway
that ultimately leads to nuclear translo-
cation of the transcription factor NF-(cid:9)B.
This  in  turn  results  in  the  transcription
of immunomodulatory genes, including
those that encode for various cytokines
and  chemokines.28 In  addition  to  a
MyD88-dependent  pathway,  certain
TLR activation can lead to MyD88-inde-
in  an
pendent  signaling  resulting 
immune response.29

TLRs  are  expressed  by  various  cells 
of  the  innate  immune  system  such  as 
keratinocytes,  neutrophils,  monocytes,
macrophages,  dendritic  cells,  and  mast
cells. Moreover, as TLRs are key players
in the innate response to pathogens, the
expression and function of TLRs at sites
of  host-pathogen  interaction  are  critical
for  host  defense.  It  is  therefore  of  little
surprise  that  the  skin,  which  is  the  first
point  of  contact  with  cutaneous  patho-
gens,  exhibits  functionally  significant
TLR  expression.  It  is  now  known  that
keratinocytes  express  TLRs  1,  2,  and  5,
with  TLR2  and  5  showing  preferential
staining  in  the  basal  keratinocytes.30 In
addition,  other  studies  have  identified
expression  of  TLR4  in  cultured  human
keratinocytes.31 TLR9 has been shown to
be  preferentially  expressed 
in  ker-
atinocytes found in the granular layer.32 A
more  recent  study  has  found  that  cul-
tured 
constitutively
express  TLR1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  9,  and  10
mRNA, but not TLR7 or 8.33,34 It has also
been suggested that keratinocyte expres-
sion  of  TLR  can  be  influenced  by
cytokines  and  growth  factors,  such  as
TGF-(cid:2).32 Furthermore,  TLR  expression
within the epidermis may correlate with
keratinocyte maturation; as cells progress
from the basal layer to the surface of the
skin,  patterns  of  TLR  expression  may
change.  TLRs  are  also  expressed  on
fibroblasts.  TLR1–9  are  expressed  and
functionally  active  on  cultured  gingival
fibroblasts.35 TLR2  and  4  are  also
fibroblasts.36

Expression of TLRs on dermal fibroblasts

Significantly,  TLR  expression  and
function  have  been  demonstrated  to
change  with  aging.  Studies  evaluating
the levels of TLR expression in murine
macrophages in aged mice have shown
significantly  lower  levels  of  expression
of  TLR.  Moreover,  when  stimulated
with  known  ligands  to  TLR2/1,  2/6,  3,
4, 5, and 9, significantly lower levels of
IL-6 and TNF-(cid:2) were produced, indicat-
ing  a  decline  in  function.37 This  sup-
ports  the  observation  that  increased
susceptibility  to  pathogens  and  poor
adaptive  immunity  in  elderly  individu-
als may be caused by a decline in TLR
expression and function. A more recent
study characterized TLR2/1 function in
humans.  TNF-(cid:2) and  IL-6  production
from  peripheral  blood-derived  mono-
cytes  were  significantly  reduced  in
those  older  than  65  years  when  com-
pared to the cohort aged 21 to 30 years.
Moreover,  surface  expression  of  TLR1
was  decreased  but  TLR2  was
unchanged  as  a  function  of  aging.38
While  these  studies  have  shown
decreased  TLR  expression  in  mono-
cytes,  the  effects  of  aging  on  ker-
atinocyte TLR expression have not yet
been described.

What role, if any, TLR expression and
function  have  in  photoaging  and  accu-
mulation of actinic damage is uncertain.
However,  the  importance  of  TLRs  in
skin has been gleaned through the study
of  various  inflammatory  skin  diseases.
For example, TLR2 has been implicated
in  the  pathogenesis  of  acne  vulgaris.

the  pathogenesis  of  acne, 
induces 
the  production  of  proinflammatory
cytokines,  such  as  IL-6  and  IL-12,  by
binding  TLR2.39 Furthermore,  TLR2
plays  an  important  role  in  the  produc-
tion  of  key  host  defense  components,
such  as  antimicrobial  peptides,  which
have  been  demonstrated  to  increase  in
culture systems when keratinocytes are
stimulated  with  P.  acnes.40 Subtle  vari-
ability  in  the  expression  of  TLR1,  2,  5,
and  9  has  been  described  in  psoriatic
lesions when compared to normal skin,
although these variances in TLR expres-
sion have not been linked to the etiology
or  pathogenesis  of  the  disease.30,41
Nevertheless,  TLR2  is  thought  to  be 
a  key  factor  in  host  response  to
Mycobacteria  leprae,  the  organism  impli-
cated in leprosy. The expression of TLR2
and  TLR1  is  markedly  increased  in
tuberculoid  leprosy  (resistant  form  of
leprosy)  when  compared  to  leproma-
tous  leprosy  (susceptible  form  of  lep-
rosy), suggesting that TLR2/1 is impor-
tant 
cell-mediated
immunity.42 Since  TLR  expression  and
function  appear  to  play  a  role  in  the
pathogenesis  of  various  inflammatory
and infectious skin conditions, modula-
tion  of  the  expression  and  function  of
these  PRRs  with  pharmacologic  agents
appears  to  be  a  potential  novel  way  in
which  certain  dermatologic  conditions
can be treated.

mediating the expression of various me-
talloproteinases.  Matrix  metallopro-
teinases (MMPs) are a group of enzymes
responsible  for  the  breakdown  of  colla-
gen  and  can  be  classified  into  four
subfamilies:  (1)  Collagenases,  (2)  gelati-
nases,  (3)  stromelysins,  and  (4)  mem-
brane-type MMPs (Table 4-3 for a sum-
mary  of  the  functions  of  the  first  three
types).  Initial  breakdown  of  collagen
depends on members of the collagenase
family that are capable of cleaving native
triple  helical  collagen.  After  the  initial
cleavage  of  collagen,  the  resultant  frag-
ments  are  further  degraded  by  gelati-
nases and stromelysins.43 The expression
of MMPs is tightly regulated and regula-
tion of the extracellular matrix involves a
balance  between  synthesis  of  structural
components  and  MMPs.  MMPs  are
expressed  primarily  by  fibroblasts,  but
also  by  macrophages  and  keratinocytes
and  the  expression  of  MMPs  is  modu-
lated by cytokines. For example, MMP-1
production from fibroblasts is stimulated
by  IL-1,  IL-6,  TNF-(cid:2),  and  TGF-(cid:3).44–46
Moreover,  other  cytokines  such  as  IL-4
inhibit  MMP  expression  and  are
chemoattractant for fibroblasts, favoring
collagen  and  fibronectin  synthesis  and
matrix preservation.47

In addition to regulation at the tran-
is
scriptional 
regulated by tissue inhibitors of metal-

level,  MMP  activity 

loproteinase (TIMP). TIMPs, low mole-
cular weight glycoproteins, are synthe-
sized  mainly 
fibroblasts  and
in 
macrophages,48 and inhibit MMP activ-
ity by forming heat-stable 1:1 stoichio-
metric  complexes.  The  expression  of
TIMPs  is  also  regulated  by  cytokines
and  growth  factors.  For  example,
TIMP-1  is  induced  by  IL-1,  IL-6,  and
EGF.45,49 Although  both  MMPs  and
TIMPs can be induced by similar stim-
uli,  the  expression  can  be  regulated  in
both a coordinated and reciprocal man-
ner. The critical balance between MMP
and  TIMP  expression  determines  the
balance  between  matrix  degradation
and  matrix  preservation.  During  peri-
ods of extracellular matrix homeostasis,
the  expression  of  MMP  and  TIMP  is
tightly  coordinated  providing 
for
appropriate remodeling without exces-
sive tissue breakdown. However, if the
amount  of  MMP  expression 
is
increased  relative  to  TIMP  expression,
excessive matrix degradation is thought
to occur.

The role of MMPs in photoaging has
been  well  documented.  Both  UVA  and
UVB radiation induce AP-1, a transcrip-
tion factor important for the expression
of MMP-1, 3, and 9.50 It is then hypoth-
esized that these MMPs are involved in
collagen  breakdown,  and  subsequent
imperfect  repair  yields  molecular  scar-

ring.23 Cumulative UV exposure and the
additive effect of molecular remodeling
results  in  visible  photoaging,  character-
ized  by  wrinkles  and  decreased  skin
tone.  Histologically,  photoaged  skin
reveals  disorganized  dermal  collagen
fibrils and increased elastin.

In  addition  to  their  ability  to  induce
cytokines  and  chemokines,  TLRs  have
been  implicated  in  the  induction  of
MMPs. Several preliminary studies have
shown that microbial agents are capable
of inducing MMP expression through a
TLR-dependent  pathway.  For  example,
in  Lyme  disease  the  causative  agent
Borrelia burgdorferi is capable of inducing
MMP-9  through  a  TLR2-dependent
mechanism.51 Moreover,  mycobacterial
cell wall components are also thought to
increase  MMP-9  through  TLR2.52 More
recently, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, the
ligand  for  TLR9,  exhibited  the  capacity
in
induce  MMP-9  expression 
to 
macrophages  via  a  TLR9/NF-(cid:9)B-depen-
dent signaling pathway.53

Kligman  and  colleagues.  The  daily

imiquimod appears to have potential as
a novel therapy for reversal of photoag-
ing  as  well  as  the  prevention  of  cuta-
neous  neoplasms.  The  exact  role
imiquimod  exerts  in  regulating  the
expression of MMP in vivo has not been
determined and further studies are war-
ranted in this area.

Retinoids

Retinoids,  a  class  of  vitamin  A-derived
compounds that bind various members of
the  retinoic  acid  receptor  family,  have
long  been  used  for  the  treatment  of
numerous inflammatory and hyperprolif-
erative  skin  diseases.  Given  the  anti-
inflammatory nature of this class of com-
pounds,  retinoids  are  increasingly  being
used to counteract the effects of and pre-
vent  photoaging.  Among  the  numerous
mechanisms  of  action  characterizing
these  vitamin  A  derivatives,  it  was

recently  shown  that  the  retinoids  exert
their  anti-inflammatory  effect  through
downregulation of TLR2.56 Because TLR2
has been implicated in the expression of
MMPs,  it  is  tempting  to  speculate  that
part  of  the  mechanism  of  action  of
retinoids  in  photoaging  is  through  the
reduction  of  MMP  expression  via  the
downregulation  of  TLR2.  Moreover,  it
has been well documented that retinoids
directly  affect  MMP  expression  through
negatively  regulating  AP-1  promoter
activity,57 thereby  displaying  utility  in
reversing photoaging. Retinoids have also
been shown to increase TIMP expression,
thus further promoting a matrix-preserv-
ing phenotype.

Retinoids  are  a  common  therapeutic
agent for both the topical and systemic
treatment  of  acne.  In  addition  to  their
antiproliferative effects, recent evidence
has emerged to partially account for the
anti-inflammatory  effect.  The  retinoid
all-trans retinoic  acid  downregulates
TLR2 and its coreceptor CD14 in mono-
cytes. Also, the addition of retinoids to
culture media reduces proinflammatory
cytokine  production  stimulated  by 
P.  acnes.56 MMPs  have  recently  gained
attention for their role in the pathogene-
sis of acne. MMP-1, 3, and 9 have been
shown  to  be  markedly  increased  in
lesional skin when compared to donor-
matched  normal  skin.58,59 The  overex-
pression  of  these  MMPs  may  in  part
account  for  the  scarring  seen  in  acne. 
It  is  possible  that  retinoids  partially 
target  MMP  expression  as  part  of 
their  therapeutic  mechanism.  Clinical
evidence supports the role of retinoids
in  preventing  scar  formation  and  also
for  the  treatment  of  both  atrophic 
and  hypertrophic  scarring,  perhaps
indicating  that  retinoid  regulation  of
MMPs  may  have  important  implica-
tions  in  the  prevention  and  treatment
of scarring.60–62

SUMMARY 

We  are  beginning  to  see  evidence  that
the immune system plays a role in skin
appearance, factoring into the phenom-
ena of aging and photoaging. While var-
ious  hypotheses  for  aging  exist,  persis-
tent  inflammation  has  received  much
attention  as  one  of  the  critical  factors
influencing  aging  in  other  organs,  for
example, in neurologic and cardiovascu-
lar conditions. Immune cells within the
skin appear to respond to pathogens, UV
radiation, and other environmental tox-
ins to engender an immune response to
protect  the  host.  Yet  the  same  mecha-

nism  through  the  activation  of  various
receptors including the TLRs can lead to
cytokine  alterations  and  have  important
implications in cellular apoptosis, inflam-
mation,  and  tissue  injury.  For  example,
the  loss  of  TGF-(cid:3) or  decreased  respon-
siveness  to  EGF  leads  to  a  decrease  in
collagen  production,  as  well  as  the
increased  breakdown  of  collagen  and
hyaluronic acid, accounting for the der-
mal  alterations  characteristic  of  pho-
toaging.

A better understanding of the mecha-
nisms  of  skin  aging,  and  photoaging  in
particular, from an immunologic perspec-
tive  should  lead  to  the  development  of
improved novel therapies. Although cur-
rently  there  are  no  FDA-approved
cytokine and growth factor therapies for
photoaging,  numerous  cosmeceutical
treatments containing these factors have
been  developed.  It  is  important  to  note
that  for  those  who  practice  evidence-
based  medicine,  not  enough  data  are
available  to  know  if  these  products
reverse  or  prevent  photoaging  and  fur-
ther studies are warranted. With the dis-
covery of TLRs and their relationship to
cytokine production as well as their indi-
rect and direct links to collagen synthesis,
it may be possible that TLRs could prove
to be realistic targets for the prevention of
photoaging.  Furthermore,  therapeutics
that directly target downstream events of
TLR  activation  such  as  modulators  of
MMPs and TIMPs may be of use. More
research  into  the  role  of  local  immune
response  in  skin  aging  should  help  pro-
vide physicians with tools to better treat
and educate our patients.

Hormones and 
Aging Skin

Larissa Zaulyanov-Scanlan, MD

It is well known that estrogen and testos-
terone play vital roles in the development
of  secondary  sexual  characteristics  and
are important for reproduction. There are
also several ongoing investigations on the
effects  of  these  sex  hormones  in  cardio-
vascular  disease,  neurodegenerative  dis-
ease, mood, and cancer formation, as well
as  into  their  roles  in  adipogenesis  and
osteogenesis in women and men. With so
many  tissues  expressing  estrogen  and
androgen receptors, it is not surprising to
find  that  several  organ  systems  experi-
ence  dramatic  changes  as  sex  hormone
levels  decline  with  advancing  age.  The
first studies of sex hormone receptors in
human skin and skin appendages began in
the  mid-1970s  and  examined  estrogen
receptors  in  breast  cancer  tissue,1 and
testosterone  receptors  in  human  hair
follicles.2 Since  that  time  several  studies
have examined the roles of sex hormones
in  a  variety  of  dermatologic  and  other
disease  states.  While  it  has  long  been
known  that  the  skin  has  sex  hormone
receptors,  the  recent  discovery  of  a  sec-
ond  estrogen  receptor  (ER-(cid:3))  has  led  to
much interest in and new insights into the
effects of sex hormones on various tissues
including the skin. The aim of this chapter
is to review the actions of sex hormones
on  the  skin,  specifically  estrogen  and
testosterone, and to examine the roles of
these hormones in skin aging.

SYNTHESIS OF SEX 
HORMONES AND THEIR 
DECLINE DURING AGING

Sex hormones are mainly synthesized in
the  gonads  and  the  adrenal  glands  of
humans.  During  puberty,  both  the  male
and female gonads begin to secrete testos-
terone.  The  prostate,  a  male  secondary
sex  organ,  can  convert  testosterone  into
the  more  potent  dihydrotestosterone
(DHT),  which  has  an  affinity  5  times  as
strong for the androgen receptor. During
the  female  reproductive  years,  most  of
the testosterone produced by the ovaries
is converted into estradiol (17(cid:3)-estradiol),
the physiologically active and most abun-
dant  estrogen  during  this  time  period.

The other two types of physiologic estro-
gens are estrone and estriol. Estrone is the
predominant  estrogen  after  menopause,
and estriol is synthesized by the placenta
during  pregnancy  (Table  5-1).  In  the
adrenal  gland,  the  precursor  to  both
estrogens  and  androgens 
is  dehy-
droepiandrosterone  (DHEA),  a  derivative
of  cholesterol.  DHEA  is  converted  into
androstenedione  in  the  adrenal  gland.
Both androstenedione and DHEA, which
by  themselves  have  weak  androgenic
activity, can enter the systemic circulation
and  be  converted  into  testosterone  or
estrogen  by  peripheral  target  cells.  The
enzyme responsible for this conversion is
aromatase.  Both  men  and  women  have
the  ability  to  convert  testosterone  into
estradiol  via  this  enzyme.  Besides  the
gonads,  other  tissues  containing  aro-
matase,  and  hence  the  ability  to  make
estradiol or testosterone from DHEA, are
bone,  brain,  vascular  tissue,  fetal  liver,
placenta,  adipose  tissue,  and  the  skin3,4
(Table 5-2).

As both men and women age, the lev-
els of DHEA and DHEAS (its sulfate ester
that can be measured in serum) produced
by the adrenal glands begin to decline, so
that by 70 to 80 years of age peak concen-
trations  are  only  10%  to  20%  of  those
found  in  young  adults.5 This  steady
decline  in  DHEA  and  DHEAS  has  been
termed  “adrenopause,”  for  the  associated
decline  in  the  adrenal  secretion  of
DHEA/DHEAS,5 although  the  levels  of
glucocorticoids  and  mineralocorticoids
(other  adrenal  hormones)  stay  relatively
constant throughout life. Since many age-

related  disturbances  have  been  reported
to begin with the decline of this hormone,
there has been much interest in the use of
DHEA  (available  as  an  over-the-counter
supplement) as a replacement therapy in
aging.  In  one  randomized,  double-blind,
controlled  trial  examining  men  and
women  aged  60  to  88  years  with  low
serum DHEAS levels, DHEA replacement
therapy  for  1  year  improved  hip  bone
mineral  density;6 however,  most  other
studies  examining  the  effects  of  DHEA
administration  in  the  elderly  have  dis-
played  mixed  results.  Furthermore,  the
risks  of  DHEA  supplementation  and  its
specific mechanisms of action are unclear.
Adrenopause,  or  a  drop  in  DHEA  and
DHEAS, is independent from menopause.
Menopause  is  the  cessation  of  menses
that  occurs  as  ovarian  follicles  diminish
over  time,  with  a  subsequent  decline  in
serum estradiol levels. Men also have an
age-associated  decline  in  gonadal  secre-
tion of testosterone, termed “andropause”
for  decline  in  androgen  levels,  and  it  is
associated with various symptoms, such
as  sexual  dysfunction,  hypogonadism,
and  psychologic  changes.7 While  meno-
pause  is  a  rapid  decline  in  circulating
estradiol  and  a  subsequent  abrupt  onset
of  symptoms,  in  men  testosterone  begins
to decrease gradually at an average rate of
1% per year, starting from age 19.7 The rea-
son(s)  for  this  steady  androgen  decline  in
men  are  not  as  well  understood  as
menopause  in  women,  but  the  decline  is
attributed to decreased secretion of GnRH
(gonadotropin-releasing hormone, secreted
by the hypothalamus)8 (Table 5-3).

ESTROGEN AND ANDROGEN 
RECEPTORS IN THE SKIN

All  steroid  hormones,  such  as  estradiol
and  testosterone,  exert  their  biologic
action  by  binding  to  nuclear  receptors,
thereby initiating transcription and trans-
lation of proteins. While the classic estro-
gen receptor (ER-(cid:2)) was discovered in the
1970s, ER-(cid:3) was discovered and isolated
from human tissue in 1996.9 Since then,
studies have shown that ER-(cid:3) is the pre-
dominant  estrogen  receptor  in  human
skin and highly expressed in the epider-
mis,  blood  vessels,  dermal  fibroblasts,
and outer root sheath of the hair follicle
(the location of the bulge and stem cells).
ER-(cid:2) and  the  androgen  receptor  (which
can  bind  testosterone  or  DHT)  are
expressed only in dermal papilla cells of
the hair follicle.10,11 All three receptors are
also  found  in  sebaceous  glands.10,11 In
eccrine  sweat  glands,  ER-(cid:3) is  highly
expressed as are, to a lesser extent, andro-
gen and progesterone receptors.11 Recent
studies  of  human  adipose  tissue  found
that sex hormone receptors differ by site,
with ER-(cid:3) being highly expressed in sub-
cutaneous  tissue.12 With  all  these  recent
findings, it is clear that sex hormones are
involved in the proliferation, differentia-
tion,  and  function  of  the  skin,  adnexal
structures, as well as fat, and that this reg-
ulation  is  far  more  intricate  than  previ-
ously  thought.  In  addition,  the  recent
description  of  the  ER-(cid:3) receptor  (ER-
(cid:3)1–5)  isoforms  has  made  this  subject
more complex.12

SEX HORMONES AND ACNE

Both  estrogen  and  androgen  receptors
are  expressed  in  sebaceous  glands,10,11
and both hormones are known to have
an  effect  on  these  structures.  During
puberty,  the  increase  of  androgenetic
hormones  triggers  sebaceous  gland
growth with increased release of sebum.
This  sebum  is  a  source  of  nutrition  for
skin  bacteria  such  as  Propionibacterium
acnes. Proliferation of these bacteria leads
to  greater  production  of  inflammatory
factors,  causing  inflammation  and  pus-
tule  formation  clinically  seen  as  acne.
Estrogens,  however,  demonstrate  anti-
inflammatory  properties  by  decreasing
neutrophil  chemotaxis,13 thereby  coun-
teracting  the  inflammatory  effects  of
P. acnes.  In  contrast,  androgens  prolong
inflammation,14 and  therefore  com-
pound their negative effects, resulting in
worsened  acne.  This  may  help  to
explain  why  so  many  young  women
with  acne  benefit  from  the  particular

hormonal  combinations  found  in  oral
contraceptives.  These  agents  are  espe-
cially useful for patients with the triad of
acne, hirsutism, and abnormal menstrual
periods. In fact, some oral contraceptives
such as Ortho TriCyclen® and Yaz® have
received  FDA  approval  for  use  in  the
treatment of acne. These oral contracep-
tives  can  relieve  the  symptoms  of  acne
by  reducing  the  amount  of  circulating
androgens.  They  also  stimulate  the
production  of  sex  hormone-binding
globulin, thus reducing free and biologi-
cally  active  testosterone  derived  from
both  the  ovaries  and  adrenal  glands.  At
the same time, they suppress the ovarian
production  of  testosterone  by  direct
gonadotropin suppression.

Hormones  also  play  a  role  in  adult
female  acne.  As  women  approach
menopause  and  their  estrogen  levels
decrease,  the  actions  of  androgens  are
unmasked.  Testosterone  stimulates  the
sebaceous glands to produce sebum, as is
seen in puberty, leading to an increase in
acne. Many female patients are surprised
to  find  themselves  with  acne  well  into
adulthood. Current studies demonstrate
that  androgen  levels  in  patients  with
acne  are  higher  than  those  in  controls,
and  the  fact  that  people  with  androgen
insensitivity  syndrome  do  not  develop
acne  also  points  to  androgens  as  the
main  culprit  in  this  condition.15 Local
factors, other than androgen plasma lev-
els, contribute to androgen levels in the
skin and thus the development of acne.
Since the skin contains enzymes such as
aromatase, it can convert precursor hor-
mones into more potent androgens such
as  testosterone  and  DHT  at  the  cellular
level. For a more extensive discussion on
acne, (see Chapter 15).

SEX HORMONES AND 
HAIR GROWTH

The hair follicle cycle is characterized by a
period of growth (anagen), followed by a
period of regression and remodeling (cata-
gen), and a period of rest (telogen). During
pregnancy,  there  is  an  increase  in  the
amount of anagen hairs secondary to the
increase  in  estradiol.  After  giving  birth,
telogen effluvium is triggered by the rapid
drop  in  estrogen,  and  is  further  sup-
pressed 
in  women  who  breastfeed
because  of  the  inhibitory  effects  of  pro-
lactin, a peptide hormone associated with
lactation,  on  estrogen  production.
Postmenopausal women often experience
a similar decrease in hair density owing to
the  decline  in  estradiol  and  the  subse-
quent unmasking of androgen effects.

For  many  decades  androgens  have
dominated hair growth research. A com-
monly  prescribed  drug  for  hair  loss,
finasteride  (Propecia®),  blocks  the  con-
version  of  testosterone  to  DHT  by
inhibiting  the  enzyme  5-(cid:2)-reductase
type II. Regarding treatment of hair loss,
finasteride  is  a  pregnancy  category  X,
thus contraindicated for women in their
childbearing  years  who  intend  to  have
children.  It  is  indicated  for  men  with
male pattern hair loss, and may be effec-
tive  for  the  treatment  of  androgenetic
alopecia,  or  male  pattern  hair  loss,  in
postmenopausal  women.16 As  both
androgen  and  estrogen  receptors  are
found  in  the  hair  follicles,  theoretically
either  of  them  can  be  targeted  for 
the  treatment  of  patterned  hair  loss.
Furthermore,  as  the  aromatase  enzyme
is located in the hair follicle and the seba-
ceous  gland,  these  tissues  can  be  both
target and source for estrogen or testos-
terone. While ER-(cid:3) is found in the bulge
region, ER-(cid:2) and androgen receptors are
found  in  the  dermal  papilla.  The  hair
cycle  is  self-renewing  because  of  the
presence of stem cells in the bulge. It is
thought  that  cells  in  the  dermal  papilla
send  a  signal  to  the  stem  cells  in  the
bulge  to  differentiate  and  ultimately
restart  the  anagen  phase.  While  it  is
known that the dermal papillae regulate
hair  growth  and  have  receptors  for
androgens and ER-(cid:3), the sequence of sig-
nals  that  regulate  hair  growth  has  not
been  elucidated.  What  is  clear  is  that
estrogens  and  androgens  are  intimately
involved in this process.

Gender differences in hair exist as evi-
denced in the commonality of androge-
netic alopecia, which occurs but is much
less  common  in  women.  This  gender
difference  may  be  attributable  more  to
the inherent enzyme content within hair
follicles  than  to  serum  hormone  levels.
For instance, Sawaya and Price17 exam-
ined  the  levels  of  5-(cid:2)-reductase  types  I
and  II,  aromatase,  and  androgen  recep-
tors in hair follicles of women and men
with  androgenetic  alopecia  and  found
that  the  women  had  a  six-fold  greater
aromatase  level  in  frontal  hair  follicles
than the men, giving them the ability to
convert weaker sex hormone precursors
into  stronger  ones.  These  authors  also
determined  that  the  women  had  three-
and three-and-a-half-fold less 5-(cid:2)-reduc-
tase types I and II, respectively, in their
hair  follicles  than  the  men  did  in  their
frontal  hair  follicles,  thus  reducing  the
women’s ability to synthesize the more
potent  form  of  male  hormone,  DHT,
which  is  responsible  for  hair  miniatur-
ization and eventual loss.17 Sawaya and

Price17 concluded that these differences
in  androgen  receptor  and  steroid-con-
verting  enzymes  may  account  for  the
different  clinical  presentations  of
androgenetic  alopecia  in  women  and
men. A similar study examining andro-
gen  receptor  and  steroid-converting
enzymes  should  be  undertaken  in
women  and  men  with  normal  hair
growth as well as those with other hair
growth disorders.

SEX HORMONES AND 
AGING SKIN

While skin quality deteriorates because
of the synergistic effects of chronologic
time,  photoaging,  and  environmental
factors such as smoking and poor nutri-
tion,  the  results  of  hormonal  decline
with age on the quality of skin are also
significant and worthy of examination.
Young  skin  is  often  associated  with
acne,  oiliness,  and  thick  scar  or  keloid
formation, while the clinically apparent
changes  associated  with  aging  skin
include skin thinning (notably, not in all
layers)  and  atrophy,  loss  of  elasticity,
dryness, increased wrinkling, and poor
wound  healing  but  cosmetically  better
surgical  scars.  While  androgen  and
estrogen receptors are found in the epi-
dermis, sebaceous glands, and hair folli-
cles,  it  is  primarily  ER-(cid:3) that  is  local-
ized  in  the  fibroblasts  of  the  dermis,
and it is the fibroblasts that synthesize
collagen,  hyaluronic  acid,  elastin,  and
other  components  of  the  extracellular
matrix.10,11 Therefore,  of  the  sex  hor-
mones,  it  is  mainly  estrogen  that
controls  the  fibroblast.  Collagen  is
responsible  for  imparting  strength  and
structure to the skin; elastin confers its
elasticity;  and  hyaluronic  acid  content
directly  leads  to  an  increase  in  water-
holding  capacity.  Together,  these  con-
stituents provide the resilience and full-
ness to the skin that is associated with
youth,  while  the  lack  of  these  con-
stituents  leads  to  wrinkles,  the  feature
most emblematic of aged skin.

In the fourth and fifth decades of life,
many  women  begin  to  notice  changes
in  their  skin  that  are  associated  with
changes seen in menopause. Most post-
menopausal  women  complain  of  skin
thinning  and  dryness,  an  increase  in
wrinkles, and decreased elasticity of the
skin. In fact, studies have shown that as
much  as  30%  of  skin  collagen  (both
type  I,  which  confers  strength  to  the
skin, and type III, which contributes to
the elasticity of skin) is lost in the first 
5  years  after  menopause,18 and  total

collagen levels are estimated to decline
on  an  average  of  2%  per  post-
menopausal  year  over  a  period  of  15
years.19 In a study by Affinito et al. that
evaluated the effects of aging and post-
menopausal hypoestrogenism on type I
and type III collagen content in the skin
of premenopausal and postmenopausal
women, a decrease in skin collagen was
more  closely  related  to  years  of  post-
menopause  than  to  chronologic  age.18
While  collagen  content  seems 
to
quickly  diminish  with  increased  post-
menopausal  years,  several  studies
demonstrate 
that  postmenopausal
women  who  start  receiving  hormone
replacement therapy (HRT) with estro-
gen  have  an  increase  in  skin  collagen
content,19–22 with  as  much  as  a  6.5%
increase in skin collagen content after 6
months of estrogen replacement.21 In a
study by Brincat et al. examining differ-
ent  regimens  of  estrogen  replacement
therapy in postmenopausal women, the
authors  found  that  all  regimens  of
estrogen  therapy  under  consideration
increased skin collagen content and that
estrogen  replacement  therapy  is  pro-
phylactic  in  women  who  have  higher
skin collagen levels and both prophylac-
tic  and  therapeutic  in  women  with
lower skin collagen levels.19 Similarly, a
study by Castelo-Branco et al. examin-
ing  skin  collagen  changes  and  HRT  in
postmenopausal  women  at  0  and 
12  months  of  treatment  showed  that
various  forms  of  HRT  with  estrogen-
induced  increases  in  skin  collagen
content  in  postmenopausal  women,
whereas  the  postmenopausal  control

BOX 5-1

group  had  significant  decreases  when
assessed  at  the  same  time  points22
(Box 5-1). In another study by Brincat et
al.23 examining skin collagen changes in
postmenopausal women receiving topi-
cal  estradiol  applied  to  the  abdomen
and  thigh,  the  authors  noted  a  strong
correlation between the change in skin
collagen  content  and  the  original  skin
collagen  content,  indicating  that  the
change in response to estrogen therapy
is  dependent  on  the  original  collagen
level,  and  that  there  is  no  further
increase in collagen production once an
“optimum”  skin  collagen 
is
reached. This study is particularly note-
worthy insofar as it suggests that there
is a therapeutic window in which estro-
gen  exerts  its  maximal  effect  in  stimu-
lating collagen production.

level 

Estrogen can also combat skin dryness
by decreasing transepidermal water loss.
In  a  study  by  Piérard-Franchimont  et  al.
that examined transepidermal water loss
in menopausal women, the authors found
that  women  receiving  transdermal  hor-
mone  replacement  with  estrogen  exhib-
ited a significantly increased water-hold-
ing  capacity  of  the  stratum  corneum  as
compared  with  menopausal  women  not
receiving  hormone  replacement.24
In
addition, in a study examining changes in
transepidermal water loss and cutaneous
blood  flow  during  the  menstrual  cycle,
Harvell  et  al.  found  that  transepidermal
water loss was higher on the day of mini-
mal  estrogen/progesterone  secretion  as
compared with the day of maximal estro-
gen  secretion  on  both  back  (p (cid:10) 0.037)
and  forearm  (p (cid:10) 0.021)  skin  in  normal

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), already in widespread use primarily to reduce the risk of osteo-
porosis, gained much attention, and some notoriety, when one of the studies in the Women’s Health
Initiative (WHI) was halted in 2002. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute (NHLBI) halted the Prempro phase (HRT phase) of the WHI during the summer of 2002
because of a higher than expected rise in breast cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots in the
legs among this cohort as well as the failure of the expected beneﬁts to materialize. The two studies
consisted of an HRT phase, estrogen plus progestin in women with a uterus, and the estrogen
replacement therapy (ERT) phase in women without a uterus. HRT is sometimes recommended for
women who have undergone natural menopause; ERT is more appropriate for women whose
menopause is surgically-induced. The ERT phase of the WHI ended in 2006. Follow-up of the women in
both studies is scheduled to conclude in 2010. Over 16,000 women were randomized in the HRT
phase to estrogen + progestin or placebo and approximately 10,000 women in the ERT phase were
likewise randomized to estrogen or placebo. Few of the participants were taking HRT (13% in the HRT
cohort and 6% in the ERT cohort), though the numbers that had ever used HRT were three-fold higher.
It has been suggested that the results of these studies are not generalizable to premenopausal/peri-
menopausal women, who are more likely to be experiencing menopausal symptoms, because many of
the women in the study may not have been experiencing menopausal symptoms any longer.

Women should decide on the appropriateness of HRT or ERT therapy in medical consultation

based on the individual’s speciﬁc risk factors and medical proﬁle. See the NIH Web site
(http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/women/pht_facts.pdf) for more information.

women.25 The use of topical estrogen has
been shown to increase epidermal thick-
ness  in  postmenopausal  women.26,27
However,  whether  the  beneficial  effects
of  estrogen  on  skin  dryness  are  attribut-
able to its influence on the fibroblast and
an  increase  in  hyaluronic  acid  content,
with  the  concomitant  increase  in  water-
retaining  capacity  of  the  dermis,  or  a
direct effect of estrogen on the epidermis
remains unclear.

While  the  number  of  sebaceous
glands  remains  the  same  during  life,  as
androgen  levels  decline  with  advanced
age,  sebum  levels  tend  to  decrease.28
Although the level of surface lipids falls
with age owing to decreased sebaceous
gland  function,  paradoxically  the  seba-
ceous glands become larger, rather than
smaller, as a result of decreased cellular
turnover.28

Subcutaneous  fat  is  also  important
when  it  comes  to  maintaining  the
appearance  of  youth,  and  fat  distribu-
tion is another area where sex hormones
play  a  vital  role.  In  postmenopausal
women,  the  decrease  in  estrogen  and
the  unmasking  effects  of  systemic
androgens lead to central fat accumula-
tion.  In  a  study  by  Dieudonne  et  al.
examining androgen receptors in mature
human  adipocytes,  androgen  binding
sites  were  found  to  differ  by  location,
with  twice  as  many  androgen  binding
sites in intra-abdominal fat than in sub-
cutaneous  fat.29 This  finding  was  the
same  for  fat  deposits  in  men  and
women.29 Another study by Dieudonne
et al. investigating the location of estro-
gen 
in  mature  human
adipocytes  of  both  men  and  women
found  that  the  predominant  estrogen
receptor  was  ER-(cid:2) and  that  its  level  of
expression  was  the  same  regardless  of
origin (intra-abdominal or subcutaneous
fat).30 These  results  suggest  that  the
deposition of subcutaneous fat is mainly
influenced by estrogen, while the deposi-
tion of abdominal fat is more androgen-
dependent.

SEX HORMONES AND 
WOUND HEALING

Sex  hormones  also  influence  wound
healing.  It  has  recently  been  demon-
strated  that  the  mechanism  by  which
estrogen can regulate the production of
connective  tissue  molecules,  namely
collagen  and  hyaluronic  acid,  is  by
increasing the production of TGF-(cid:3),31 a
key modulator of wound healing. In a
randomized,  double-blind  study  by
Ashcroft  et  al.  that  examined  the

effects  of  topical  estrogen  on  cuta-
neous  wound  healing 
in  healthy
elderly men and women after receiving
punch  biopsies  and  related  these
effects  to  the  inflammatory  response
and local elastase levels (a matrix met-
alloproteinase  known  to  be  upregu-
lated in chronic wounds); it was found
that  compared  to  placebo  treatment,
estrogen 
the
extent  of  wound  healing  in  both
elderly  males  and  females.13 These
authors  further  determined  that  estro-
gen  treatment  was  associated  with  a
decrease  in  wound  elastase  levels  sec-
ondary to reduced neutrophil numbers
and decreased fibronectin degradation.
Similarly,  an  observational  study
showed 
that  HRT  recipients  are
approximately 30% to 40% less likely
to develop a venous leg ulcer or a pres-
sure  ulcer  than  nonrecipients.32
In
contrast,  androgens  appear  to  prolong
inflammation and inhibit wound heal-
ing.14,33,34 Estrogen  also  promotes
wound  healing  by  increasing  tissue
expression  of  vascular  endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), an effect that is
antagonized  by  androgens;  therefore,
estrogen  can  promote  neovasculariza-
tion  that  is  necessary  for  wound
healing while androgens inhibit it.14

As  estrogen  has  a  direct  stimulatory
role on dermal fibroblasts, it also affects
scarring. Aged skin is associated with a
reduced rate of cutaneous wound heal-
ing  and  improved  quality  of  scarring,
while young skin heals quickly but often
with  thick,  visible  scars.  Keloids  and
hypertrophic  scars  are  generally  condi-
tions of youth, owing to an increase in
TGF-(cid:3) production by dermal fibroblasts,
while scarless wound healing is a char-
acteristic  of  fetal  skin  that,  like  aged
skin,  has  lower  levels  of  TGF-(cid:3).35 As
estrogen  is  known  to  increase  TGF-(cid:3),
and  is  therefore  profibrotic,  antiestro-
gens  such  as  tamoxifen  have  been
shown to decrease TGF-(cid:3) levels,36,37 and
are antifibrotic. Therefore, tamoxifen or
other estrogen receptor modulators may
be useful in improving scar cosmesis.

HORMONE REPLACEMENT 
THERAPY

The therapeutic benefits of HRT on eas-
ing  postmenopausal  symptoms  or
improving  bone  density  have  been
known  for  many  years.  However,  the
benefits  of  HRT  on  skin  aging  and
wound healing are just beginning to be
explored.  While  many  postmenopausal
women  would  derive  great  cutaneous

benefits from estrogen therapy, as estro-
gens  are  known  to  affect  several  organ
systems,  this  subject  is  best  addressed
on a case-by-case basis and as part of a
team approach with other physicians so
that  all  risks  and  benefits  are  weighed.
The primary risks associated with HRT
are  related  to  breast  cancer  and  cardio-
vascular  health;  the  primary  benefits
include relief of menopausal symptoms
(such  as  vasomotor  instability,  sexual
dysfunction, mood fluctuation, and skin
atrophy) and a decrease in fracture risk.
Current  recommendations  specify  that
HRT should only be used short term, for
moderate  to  severe  vasomotor  symp-
toms, and primarily in younger women
who  are  close  to  menopause  (early
menopause  or  first  5  years  after
menopause). It is important to note that
estrogen-containing  creams  are  con-
traindicated for women who have been
diagnosed  with  estrogen-responsive
cancers.  Regarding  the  use  of  topical
versus  oral  estrogens,  topical  estrogens
are easily absorbed (hence the popular-
ity  of  estrogen  replacement  in  patch  or
gel  form),  but  the  cutaneous  route
avoids  hepatic  first-pass  metabolism
and  high  plasma  levels  of  estrogen
metabolites  are  associated  with  oral
administration.

SUMMARY

For  centuries,  women  have  noted  skin
changes following menopause. Multiple
studies  show  that  women  experience
decreased skin thickness with a related
reduction in the amount of skin collagen
that occurs most rapidly in the first five
postmenopausal  years.  Skin  dryness
may  be  related  to  decreased  levels  of
hyaluronic  acid  as  well  as  epidermal
thinning. For these reasons, oral or topi-
cal HRT may be useful to prevent such
changes  in  postmenopausal  women.
While men do not experience the same
abrupt  decline  in  sex  hormones  as
women do with menopause, their char-
acteristic  hormonal  composition  also
undergoes  a  decline  with  age,  as  wit-
nessed  by  changes  in  their  skin  and
other organ systems. Whether the skin
of  elderly  men  would  benefit  from
hormone  replacement,  and  in  what
combination,  is  another  vast  subject
worthy  of  exploration.  While  estrogen
promotes  wound  healing  and  testos-
terone seems to inhibit it, treating men
with  estrogens  long  term  would  cer-
tainly have a feminizing effect. Perhaps
future  research  into  sex  hormones  and
aging  skin  should  focus  on  hormone

 
 
 
receptor  or  tissue  enzyme  modulators.
Currently,  most  of  these  agents  are
being developed and utilized in the field
of oncology.

Hormonal  influences  on  the  health
and  function  of  skin  are  an  important
topic  in  dermatology  that  warrant  due
consideration  by  the  cosmetic  practi-
tioner  in  assessing  health  or  prescreen-
ing  patients’  skin  prior  to  performing
corrective  procedures.  The  beneficial
effect  of  estrogen  on  collagen  produc-
tion  and  in  the  promotion  of  wound
healing  is  clear.  Future  investigations
into the effects of sex hormones on the
skin  and  adnexa  are  likely  to  indicate
that sex hormones constitute a promis-
ing target for therapeutic intervention in
both cosmetic and medical dermatology.

scientific  knowledge 

As  life  expectancy  has  increased  and
“baby  boomers”  have  begun  to  enter
middle  age,  interest  has  increased  in
slowing the aging process. Implied in this
escalating interest is the confidence that
greater 
and
advancements  in  technology  may  allow
us to control the physical manifestations
of  aging.  In  the  meantime,  more  and
more people are becoming aware of the
external  factors  implicated  in  premature
aging. Although dermatologists have dis-
cussed, since the end of the 19th century,1
the  notion  that  sunlight  contributes  to
premature  aging,  there  remains  a  great
need for education to convince people of
the hazards posed by sun exposure.

The  consequences  to  the  skin  of
chronic sun exposure are readily appar-

ent  when  one  compares  the  exposed
skin  of  the  face,  hands,  or  neck  to  the
unexposed  skin  of  the  buttocks,  inner
thigh,  or  inner  arm  (Fig.  6-1).  This  sun
damage  can  be  highlighted  by  using  a
Wood’s lamp, blue light, or an ultravio-
let camera system, rendering the epider-
mal  pigment  component  more  notice-
able  (Figs.  6-2,  6-3,  and  6-4).  Showing
such results to sun-seeking patients can
prove  useful  in  convincing  them  of  the
havoc that the sun has wreaked on their
skin.

The  sun  is  not  the  sole  source  or
cause of skin aging. It is the major exter-
nal  cause  among  several  components,
both  endogenous  and  exogenous.  This
chapter will concentrate, though, on the
role  of  the  sun  on  the  extrinsic  aging
process of the skin, also known as pho-
toaging.

aging,  intrinsic  and  extrinsic.  Intrinsic

aging reflects the genetic background of
an  individual  and  results  from  the
passage of time. It is inevitable and, thus,
beyond  voluntary  control.  Extrinsic
aging  is  engendered  by  external  factors
such  as  smoking,  excessive  use  of  alco-
hol,  poor  nutrition,  and  sun  exposure,
which  in  many  cases  can  be  reduced
with  effort.  This  process,  then,  is  not
inevitable  and,  by  definition,  refers  to
premature skin aging. It is believed that
as  much  as  80%  of  facial  aging  can  be
ascribed to sun exposure.2

INTRINSIC VERSUS 
EXTRINSIC AGING

Intrinsically  aged  skin  is  smooth  and
unblemished, with exaggerated expres-
sion  lines  but  preservation  of  the  nor-
mal  geometric  patterns  of  the  skin.
Under  the  microscope,  such  skin
demonstrates  epidermal  atrophy,  flat-
tening of the epidermal rete ridges, and
dermal atrophy.3 Collagen fibrils are not
thickened  but  are  elevated  in  number
with  an  increase  in  the  collagen  III  to
collagen I ratio.4

Extrinsically  aged  skin  appears  pre-
dominantly in exposed areas such as the
face, chest, and extensor surfaces of the
arms. It is a result of the total effects of a
lifetime  of  exposure  to  ultraviolet
radiation  (UVR).  Clinical  findings  of
photoaged  skin  include  wrinkles  and
pigmented  lesions  such  as  freckles,
lentigines,  and  patchy  hyperpigmenta-
tion,  and  depigmented  lesions  such  as
guttate  hypomelanosis 
(Fig.  6-5).
Interestingly, a study in the Journal of the
American  Medical  Association reported
that  children  with  the  tendency  to
freckle  developed  30%  to  40%  fewer
freckles  when  treated  with  an  SPF  30
sunscreen daily as compared to children
not  treated  with  a  sunscreen.5 This
study  illustrates  the  importance  of  sun
protection  in  the  prevention  of  these
pigmented  lesions  that  not  only  make
the  skin  appear  older,  but  also  are
known  to  be  associated  with  an
increased risk of melanoma. Other signs
of skin aging include a loss of tone and
elasticity,  increased  skin  fragility,  areas
of  purpura  owing  to  blood  vessel
weakness,  and  benign  lesions  such  as
keratoses,  telangiectasias,  and  skin  tags
(Fig. 6-6). Glogau developed a photoag-
ing  scale  that  is  used  to  classify  the
extent  of  clinical  photodamage  (Table
6-1).  Patients  with  a  significant  history

 
 
 
of  sun  exposure  may  score  higher  on
this  scale  than  expected  for  their  age,
just  as  patients  with  a  history  of  mini-
mal  sun  exposure  may  achieve  a  score
lower than expected for their age.

The  histopathologic  alterations  in
photoaged skin are easily distinguished
and characterized by elastosis (Fig. 6-7).
Photoaged  skin  is  also  marked  by  epi-
dermal atrophy and discrete changes in
collagen  and  elastic  fibers.  In  severely
photoaged  skin,  the  collagen  fibers  are
fragmented, 
thickened,  and  more
soluble.6 Elastic  fibers  also  appear  frag-
mented  and  may  exhibit  progressive
cross-linkage  and  calcification.7 These
alterations in collagen and elastic fibers
have been demonstrated to worsen with
continued UV exposure.

CHARACTERISTICS OF 
AGED SKIN

Regardless of the etiology of skin aging,
there  are  important  characteristics  of
aged  skin  that  must  be  considered.
These  changes  occur  throughout  the
epidermis,  dermis,  and  subcutaneous
tissue  and  can  result  in  wide-ranging
alterations  in  the  topography  of  the
skin.

Epidermis

Although  age-related  changes  in  the
dermis are more pronounced than those
in  the  epidermis,  the  epidermis  does
exhibit  such  alterations.  Some  studies
suggest that aged skin displays a thinner
epidermis,6,8 but  other  studies  do  not
bear such findings out.9,10 Most studies
are  in  agreement,  though,  that  the
thickness of the stratum corneum is un-
changed with aging. One study demon-
strated that the spinous layer of a wrin-
kle is thinner in the bottom or valley of
the wrinkle than the spinous layer at the
wrinkle’s  flanks.11 This  study  also
showed  that  fewer  keratohyaline  gran-
ules are present in the base of a wrinkle
as compared to its flanks (Fig. 6-8).

Unlike  the  stratum  corneum,  the
junction of the epidermis and dermis is
altered  in  aged  skin.  Aged  epidermis
exhibits  a  flattening  of  the  dermal–
epidermal  junction  (DEJ)  with  a  corre-
spondingly  smaller  connecting  surface
area.  One  study  of  abdominal  skin
showed that the surface area of the DEJ
decreased  from  2.64  mm2 in  subjects
aged 21 to 40 years to 1.90 mm2 in sub-
jects aged 61 to 80 years.12 This loss of
DEJ  surface  area  may  lead  to  the
increased  fragility  of  the  skin  and  may

also  result  in  less  nutrient  transfer
between the dermis and epidermis.

DECREASED  CELL  TURNOVER The  epider-
mal  turnover  rate  slows  from  30%  to
50%  between  the  third  and  eighth
decades  of  life.7 Kligman  demonstrated
that  stratum  corneum  transit  time  was
20 days in young adults and 30 or more
days in older adults.13 This lengthening
of  the  cell  cycle  corresponds  to  a  pro-
longed  stratum  corneum  replacement
rate  and  decelerated  wound  healing.  In
fact,  it  has  been  shown  that  older
patients take twice as long to re-epithe-
lialize  after  dermabrasion  resurfacing
procedures  when  compared  with
younger patients.14 The slow cell cycle is
combined with less effective desquama-
tion  in  many  elderly  individuals.  The
result  is  the  development  of  heaps  of
corneocytes that render the skin surface
dull  and  rough  in  appearance.  Con-
sequently,  many  cosmetic  dermatolo-
gists  employ  products  such  as  hydroxy
acids or retinoids to “speed up” the cell
cycle  with  the  belief  that  a  faster
turnover  rate  will  ameliorate  skin
appearance and accelerate wound heal-
ing after cosmetic procedures.

Dermis

Elderly  individuals  exhibit  a  loss  of
approximately 20% of dermal thickness.14
Examination of the structure of the aged
dermis reveals that it is relatively acellu-
lar and avascular.3 Aged dermis is further
characterized  by  changes  in  collagen
production and the development of frag-
mented  elastic  fibers.  The  dermis  that
has been exposed to ultraviolet light also
manifests  disorganized  collagen  fibrils
and  the  accumulation  of  abnormal
elastin-containing  material  15 (Fig  6-7).
The  three  components  of  the  dermis
that have received the most attention in
antiaging  research  are  collagen,  elastin,
and glycosaminoglycans.

COLLAGEN Awareness  of  the  importance
of collagen in the aging process has led to
the  manufacture  of  many  collagen-
containing  topical  products  as  well  as
injectable  materials  such  as  Zyderm,
Zyplast,  CosmoDerm,  CosmoPlast,  and
Evolence.  Other  components  in  targeted
topical  products,  such  as  vitamin  C  and
glycolic acid, owe some of their popularity
to the claims that these agents can increase
collagen  synthesis.  These  products  are
usually  labeled  as  “antiwrinkle  creams.”
Although wrinkles are common, it is inter-
esting  that  little  is  really  known  about
their pathogenesis.16 This may be due to

Anchoring  fibrils,  made  of  collagen
VII,  are  important  because  they  attach
the  basement  membrane  zone  to  the
underlying  papillary  dermis.  Patients
with chronically sun-exposed skin have
been  characterized  as  having  a  signifi-
cantly lower number of anchoring fibrils
when compared to normal controls. The
investigators  who  made  this  observa-
tion  postulated  that  a  weakened  bond
between  the  dermis  and  epidermis
owing  to  loss  of  anchoring  fibrils  leads
to  wrinkle  formation.21 Interestingly,  a
more  recent  study  demonstrated  that
this  loss  of  collagen  VII  was  more  pro-
nounced at the base of the wrinkle (sim-
ilar to that seen with collagen IV in the
same study)11 (Fig. 6-8).

The mechanism of action of how UVR
induces  collagen  damage  has  been  well
characterized in the last decade. It is now
known  that  UVR  exposure  dramatically
upregulates  the  production  of  several
types  of  collagen-degrading  enzymes
known  as  matrix  metalloproteinases
(MMP).  This  occurs  by  the  following
mechanism:  UV  exposure  causes  an
increase  in  the  amount  of  the  transcrip-
tion factor c-jun (c-fos is abundant with-
out  UV  exposure).  These  two  transcrip-
tion factors, c-jun and c-fos, combine to
(AP-1),
produce  activator  protein-1 
which activates the MMP genes resulting
in  production  of  collagenase,  gelatinase,
and  stromelysin.  It  has  been  demon-
strated  in  humans  that  MMPs,  specifi-
cally  collagenase  and  gelatinase,  are
induced within hours of UVB exposure.22
Fisher et al. showed that multiple expo-
sures to UVB yield a sustained induction
of MMPs.15 Because collagenase degrades
collagen, long-term elevations in collage-
nase and other MMPs likely result in the
disorganized and clumped collagen seen
in  photoaged  skin.  These  MMPs  may
represent the mechanism through which
collagen  I  levels  are  reduced  following
UV exposure.

Mitogen-Activated  Protein  Kinases  and
Aging Mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs)  are  serine–threonine  protein
kinases, meaning they phosphorylate the
OH  side  chain  of  serine  and  threonine.
Significantly,  they  are  involved  in  signal
transduction pathways for cell prolifera-
tion, differentiation, and apoptosis. Thus
far,  four  groups  of  MAPKs  have  been
identified:  extracellular  signal-regulated
kinases  (ERKs),  c-Jun  amino-terminal
kinases (JNKs), also known as stress-acti-
vated  protein  kinases  (SAPKs),  p38
kinase, and ERK5. ERKs are activated via
growth factors and play a role in cell pro-
liferation  and  differentiation.  JNKs,  on

the fact that neither an animal model nor
an  in  vitro  model  of  wrinkling  has  been
established.  It  is  well  established,  how-
ever,  that  alterations  in  collagen  seem  to
be important in the aging process, which
accounts for the popularity of “antiaging,”
collagen-containing products.

Collagen constitutes 70% of dry skin
mass.17 The collagen in aged skin is char-
acterized  by  thickened  fibrils  organized
in rope-like bundles, which are in disar-
ray as compared to the organized pattern
seen  in  younger  skin.3 Type  I  collagen
comprises  80%  and  type  III  collagen
comprises  approximately  15%  of  the
total  skin  collagen  of  young  skin.
However,  as  the  skin  ages,  the  ratio  of
type  III  to  type  I  collagen  has  been
shown to increase (meaning that there is
less  type  I  collagen  with  aging).18
Collagen  type  I  levels  were  shown  to
decrease by 59% in irradiated skin;15 this

reduction  was  found  to  correlate  with
the extent of photodamage.19 It is known
that the overall collagen content per unit
area  of  skin  surface  decreases  approxi-
mately  1%  per  year.20 Although  type  I
collagen  is  the  most  abundant  in  the
skin,  the  other  types  of  collagen  in  the
dermis may also be affected by aging.

Collagen IV, a key component in the
DEJ,  provides  a  framework  for  other
molecules  and  is  important  in  the
maintenance  of  mechanical  stability.
Although  studies  have  shown  no
difference  in  collagen  IV  levels  in  sun-
exposed  skin  in  comparison  to  nonex-
posed  skin,  a  significant  diminution  of
collagen IV was found in the bottom of
wrinkles  when  compared  to  the  flanks
of wrinkles (Fig. 6-8). This loss of colla-
gen IV may affect the mechanical stabil-
ity of the DEJ and contribute to wrinkle
formation.11

and coiling of elastic fibers in the papil-
lary  dermis  distinguish  the  alterations
induced by UV exposure. Continued UV
exposure leads to these same changes in
the  reticular  dermis.29 Electron  micro-
scopy  examination  of  the  elastic  fibers
reveals an increase in the complexity of
the shape and arrangement of the fibers,
a decrease in the number of microfibrils,
a higher number of electron-dense inclu-
sions,  and  more  interfibrillar  areas.30
Elastin extracted from the skin of elderly
patients has been shown to contain small
amounts of sugar and lipids and an abnor-
mally  high  level  of  polar  amino  acids.3
The  mechanism  of  these  changes  is  not 
as  well  understood  as  it  is  in  collagen;
however,  MMPs  likely  play  a  role
because  MMP-2  has  been  shown  to
degrade elastin.31

It is known that the initial response of
elastic  fibers  to  photodamage  is  hyper-
plastic,  resulting  in  increased  elastic
tissue.  The  magnitude  of  this  response
depends on the degree of sun exposure.
The  second  phase  of  response,  seen  in
aged  elastic  fibers,  is  degenerative,
in  reduced  elasticity  and
resulting 
resiliency of the skin.32,33 Aged skin that
has  suffered  this  degenerative  response
manifests  an  alteration  in  the  normal
pattern of immature elastic fibers, called
oxytalan, which are found in the papil-
lary  dermis.  In  young  skin,  these  fibers
form a network that ascends perpendic-
ularly  from  the  uppermost  portion  of
the  papillary  dermis  to  just  below  the
basement  membrane 
in 
Chapter  2).  As  skin  ages,  this  network
gradually disappears.34 In fact, a loss of
skin elasticity has been shown to incre-
mentally  increase  with  age.35 This  loss
of  elasticity  may  account  for  much  of
the  sagging  often  seen  in  the  skin  of
elderly individuals.

(Fig.  2-5 

GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS Glycosamino-
glycans (GAGs)  are  important  mole-
cules  because  they  can  bind  water  up
to 1000 times their volume. The GAG
family  includes  hyaluronic  acid  (HA),
chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sul-
fate,  among  many  other  constituents.
Numerous  studies  report  that  GAGs,
in
especially  HA,  are  decreased 
amount in photoaged skin.36 However,
some  conflicting  studies  report  no
change in the amount of GAGs in aged
skin.37

A study by Uitto demonstrated that
photoaged skin exhibits a reduction in
HA  and  an  increase  in  chondroitin
sulfate  proteoglycans,38 which,  inter-
estingly, is a pattern also seen in scars.
In  young  skin,  the  HA  is  found  at  the

the other hand, respond to stressful stim-
uli  such  as  UV  light,  osmotic  shock,  or
cytokines,23 and  are  involved  in  cellular
apoptosis.24 In  addition,  p38  kinase  is
activated via stress-induced stimuli. It has
been  demonstrated  that  a  synchronized
inhibition  of  ERKs  and  activation  of
JNK/p38  must  be  present  for  cellular
apoptosis,  suggesting  that  a  “balance”
among  these  groups  influences  cell  sur-
vival  versus  death.25 The  MAPKs  have
been  implicated  in  both  intrinsic  and
extrinsic  aging  of  skin.  Chung  et  al.
demonstrated that JNK activity is higher
and  ERK  activity  lower  in  intrinsically
aged  skin.26 As  previously  mentioned,
the  combination  of  UV-induced  c-jun

(through the JNK pathway), and naturally
expressed  c-fos  produces  AP-1,  which
promotes the  degrading of collagen and
the  extracellular  matrix  by  increasing
MMPs.27 AP-1  has  an  additional  impact
in  collagen  loss  by  decreasing  collagen  I
gene expression.28 Therefore, some colla-
gen reduction in photoaged skin may be
explained  by  the  role  of  AP-1  in  both
increasing MMPs and decreasing collagen
synthesis.

ELASTIN Changes in elastic fibers are so
characteristic  in  photoaged  skin  that
“elastosis,”  an  accumulation  of  amor-
phous  elastin  material,  is  considered  a
hallmark of photoaged skin. Thickening

periphery of collagen and elastin fibers
and  at  the  interface  of  these  types  of
fibers.  Such  connections  with  HA  are
absent in aged skin.36 Decreases in the
amount  of  HA,  leading  to  its  lack  of
association  with  collagen  and  elastin
and  decreased  water  binding,  may 
play a role in the changes seen in aged
skin  including  decreased  turgidity,

to 

MELANOCYTES The  number  of  melano-
cytes  decreases  from  8%  to  20%  per
decade.  This  is  displayed  clinically 
by  a  reduction  in  the  number  of
melanocytic  nevi  in  older  individuals.3
Because  melanin  absorbs  carcinogenic
UV light, the skin of older patients is less
able  to  protect  itself  from  the  sun  and,
consequently, is at greater risk for devel-
oping sun-induced cancers. It is for this
reason  that  sun  protection  is  important
even for patients who feel it is “too late”
to begin adding a sunscreen to their skin
care regimens.

Vasculature

Many  studies  have  shown  that  aged
skin is relatively avascular. One particu-
lar study demonstrated a 35% reduction
in  the  venous  cross-sectional  area  in
aged skin as compared to young skin.39
This  reduction  in  the  vascular  network
is  particularly  obvious  in  the  papillary
dermis with loss of the vertical capillary
loops.  Such  a  reduction  of  vascularity
results  in  decreased  blood  flow,  dimin-
ished nutrient exchange, impaired ther-
moregulation,  lower  skin  surface  tem-
perature, and skin pallor.

Subcutaneous Tissue

Elderly  skin  displays  both  a  loss  and  a
gain  of  subcutaneous  tissue  that  is  site
specific.  Subcutaneous  fat  is  decreased
in the face, as well as the dorsal aspects
of the hands and the shins. Other areas,
however,  such  as  the  waist  in  women
and  the  abdomen  in  men,  accumulate
fat with aging3 (see Chapter 3).

UV IRRADIATION AND 
UROCANIC ACID ISOMERS

The cutaneous barrier is the initial line
of defense, protecting other organs from
external antigens, bacteria, and viruses,
as  well  as  UV  light.  Ultraviolet  irradia-
tion  is  a  well-known  contributor  to
decreased immunity of the skin, leading
to less recognition of abnormal cells and

in 

the 

eventually development of skin cancers.
Trans-urocanic  acid 
(trans-UCA),  a
metabolite  of  histidine,  is  commonly
present in the epidermal skin layers. As
discussed  in  Chapter  11,  histidine  is
mostly derived from filaggrin in the epi-
dermis  and  gets  converted  to  trans-
UCA,  which  plays  an  integral  role  in
epidermal  hydration.  Following  UV
exposure,  trans-UCA  is  photoisomer-
ized  into  cis-urocanic  acid  (cis-UCA),  a
known  photoreceptor  for  UV  light 
(Fig.  6-9).  cis-UCA  is  a  well-recognized
skin.
immunosuppressant 
Impaired  delayed  hypersensitivity
reaction  and  decreased  function  of
epidermal  antigen-presenting 
cells
(Langerhans  cells)  occur  following
exposure  to  cis-UCA  through  TNF-(cid:2)
release.40,41 Interestingly,  the  effect  of
cis-UCA  is  dose  dependent.42 In  addi-
tion  to  UV  irradiation  dose,  skin  pig-
mentation  is  an  important  factor.  Fair-
skinned  subjects  have  been  shown  to
produce  more  cis-UCA  with  lower
doses  of  UV  light  when  compared  to
darker-skinned individuals.43 It has been
suggested  that  cis-UCA  decreases  the
ability of APCs to present the abnormal
cells and antigens to the immune system,
thereby contributing to UV carcinogene-
sis.44 However, the exact role of cis-UCA
in  skin  cancers  is  not  well  understood
and  the  few  studies  performed  on  this
subject have not revealed a direct asso-
ciation  between  the  total  UCA  levels
and  skin  cancer.  In  a  study  by  De  Fine
Olivarius  et  al.  of  the  total  UCA  and

and  sun-protected  areas  of  skin  in
patients with a history of basal cell car-
cinoma (BCC), patients with malignant
melanoma,  and  healthy  subjects,  the
total  UCA  and  cis-UCA  levels  did  not
differ  among  the  three  groups,  while
the  percentage  of  cis-UCA  was  found 
to  be  higher  in  patients  with  a  history 
of  basal  cell  carcinoma  (BCC)  and
melanoma as compared to healthy indi-
viduals.45 Another  study  conducted  by
Snellman  et  al.  also  failed  to  demon-
strate  a  statistically  significant  increase
of  UCA  with  UV  exposure  in  subjects
with a history of BCC and melanoma.46

THE ROLE OF FREE 
RADICALS IN PHOTOAGING

Free  radicals,  also  known  as  reactive
oxygen species, are composed of oxygen
with an unpaired electron and are created
by UV exposure, pollution, stress, smok-
ing,  and  normal  metabolic  processes.
They are suspected to be the cause, or at
least  a  major  contributor,  to  the  aging
process.  There  is  evidence  to  suggest
that free radicals induce changes in gene
expression  pathways  that  lead  to  the
degradation  of  collagen  and  accumula-
tion  of  elastin  characteristic  of  pho-
toaged  skin.31 Antioxidants  neutralize
these reactive oxygen species by provid-
ing  another  electron,  which  gives  the
oxygen  ion  an  electron  pair  thereby
stabilizing it (see Chapter 35).

It has been demonstrated that follow-
ing a single dose of UV irradiation there 
is  an  initial  decrease  in  expression  and
activity  of  antioxidant  enzymes  in  the
cultured  fibroblasts  of  skin.47 In  this
study, the antioxidant enzymes increased
even  to  higher  than  pre-exposure  levels
in  a  few  days,  probably  as  a  defense
mechanism  in  preparation  for  more
potential UV exposure.

TANNING AND ITS EFFECTS 
ON THE SKIN

UV  light  stimulates  the  production  of
melanin  by  causing  (cid:2)-melanocyte-
stimulating  hormone  ((cid:2)-MSH)  to  be
secreted  by  keratinocytes.  Redheads
have a defect in the proopiomelanocortin
(POMC) gene that prevents this tanning
response  from  occurring.  Data  recently
published in Cell showed that the tumor
suppressor protein p53, when “stressed”
by UV, activates the POMC gene, which
leads to both tanning and an increase in
(cid:3)-endorphin.48 This  may  explain  why
some  people  state  that  they  feel  good

nies are looking at ways to safely stimu-
late  p53  to  create  a  “protective”  tan  but
much more research is necessary.

CHANGES IN SKIN 
APPEARANCE

Dry Skin

function 

Elderly  people  often  display  dry  scaled
skin.  This  is  due  in  part  to  the  loss  of
barrier 
that  occurs  with
increasing  age  (see  Chapter  11).  Aged
skin  exhibits  increased  transepidermal
water loss; therefore, it is susceptible to
becoming dry in low-humidity environ-
ments. The recovery of damaged barrier
function has been shown to be slower in
aged skin leading to an increased suscep-
tibility  to  dryness.  This  is  caused  by  a
combination  of  factors  including  lower
lipid  levels  in  lamellar  bodies49 and  a
reduction  in  epidermal  filaggrin  (see
Chapter  11).50 Roughness,  wrinkling,
skin  pallor,  and  the  appearance  of  dark
and  light  spots  also  affect  the  appear-
ance  and  texture  of  aged  skin.  In  addi-
tion, aged skin is typically characterized
by  laxity,  fragility,  easy  bruising,  and
benign neoplasms. 

Benign Neoplasms in Aging Skin

The  surface  texture  and  appearance  of
skin  can  change  dramatically  through
age with the emergence of acrochordons
(skin tags), cherry angiomas, seborrheic
keratoses, lentigos (sun spots), and seba-
ceous hyperplasias. It is not uncommon
for cosmetic patients to request removal
of  these  benign  neoplasms.  There  are
several  different  destructive  treatment
modalities  available,  such  as  hyfreca-
tion, curettage, and laser.

TREATMENT 

Many  different  topical  agents  and  in-
office procedures are used to treat pho-
toaged  skin.  Most  of  these  remedies
function by “resurfacing” the epidermis.
The goal is to remove the damaged epi-
dermis  and,  in  some  instances,  dermis,
and  allow  them  to  be  replaced  with
remodeled  skin  layers.  There  is  some
evidence that resurfacing procedures can
induce  the  formation  of  new  collagen
with  a  normal  staining  pattern  in  con-
trast to the basophilic elastotic masses of
collagen  present  in  photoaged  skin.51
Although  there  are  several  treatments
available for aged skin, prevention is still
paramount  and  should  be  emphasized
to all patients.

PREVENTION

It is well established that sun avoidance
and  sunscreen  use  are  important  adju-
vants  to  antiaging  regimens.  Obviously,
sun avoidance is not always possible and
hardly  a  popular  behavioral  adjustment
for  many  patients.  However,  patients
should be discouraged from engaging in
unnecessary  sun  exposure,  particularly
between 10 AM and 4 PM, and any expo-
sure  to  tanning  beds.  Sunscreen  should
be recommended for use on a daily basis,
even when the patient remains indoors.
Patients  should  be  reminded  that  UVA
rays  have  the  capacity  to  pass  through
glass, thus individuals are at risk of solar
exposure even in their cars and homes as
well  as  at  work.  UVA  shields  can  be
placed on windows, providing some pro-
tection. Sun protective clothing, such as
a  broad-brimmed  hat  and  SPF  45  cloth-
ing,  should  be  encouraged  for  patients
planning any protracted exposure to the
sun. Many patients believe that their sun
exposure  is  minimal  and  does  not  war-
rant  daily  use  of  sunscreen.  Use  of  a
Wood’s or a UV light to reveal solar dam-
age is a helpful way to convince patients
of the necessity of sun avoidance. Such a
demonstration  will  also  make  them
more  likely  to  employ  preventive  mea-
sures,  such  as  sunscreens,  antioxidants,
and retinoids, when sun avoidance is im-
practical.  Sunscreens,  antioxidants,  and
retinoids  are  discussed  in  upcoming
chapters.

SUMMARY 

Rough,  dry  skin,  mottled  pigmentation,
and  wrinkling  epitomize  the  clinical
appearance  of  photoaging.  Extensive  or
severe photodamage can also be a precur-
sor  to  skin  cancer.  Despite  increasing
awareness  of  the  risks  of  prolonged  sun
exposure,  too  many  people  remain
unaware that the proverbial “healthy tan”
is, in fact, evidence of photodamage and
indicative of premature aging. It is incum-
bent  upon  the  dermatologist  to  educate
patients  on  the  ravages  of  the  sun,  the
importance  of  sun  avoidance  and  sun-
protective behavior, and, as always, tailor
treatments to individual patient needs.

Cigarettes and 
Aging Skin

Leslie Baumann, MD

While there remains a good deal to learn
about the mechanisms and factors related
to  intrinsic  skin  aging,  scientists  have  a
stronger grasp of the numerous exogenous
factors  implicated  in  the  aging  of  skin,
among  them  sun  exposure  and  lifestyle
choices  such  as  smoking,  drinking,  and
poor  nutrition.  Of  course,  the  internal
ramifications of smoking are much better
known  than  are  the  external  results,  but
more than two decades of epidemiologic
research  findings  indicate  that  smokers
indeed  manifest  greater  facial  aging  and
skin  wrinkling  than  nonsmokers.1 This
chapter  reviews  the  literature  and  dis-
cusses what is known about the effects on
skin of chronic cigarette smoking.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

A  relationship  between  smoking  and
skin wrinkling was observed as long ago
as  1856.1–3 Despite  this  relatively  early
recognition,  scant  research  has  focused
on  the  effects  of  smoking  on  the  skin
and  skin  disease.  Therefore,  the  effects
of smoking on skin are not nearly as well
understood  as  the  strong  correlation
between  smoking  and  lung  cancer,
emphysema,  chronic  bronchitis,  heart
disease, and other serious systemic con-
ditions.3,4 Recent  studies  have  suc-
ceeded,  though,  in  filling  in  significant
gaps in knowledge regarding the typical
cutaneous  manifestations  of  the  sys-
temic  alterations  wrought  by  smoking,
and  the  potential  mechanisms  behind
such changes.

SYMPTOMS

The characteristics typically cited as evi-
dence  of  “smoker’s  face”  (Fig.  7-1) or
“cigarette  skin”  include  increased  facial
wrinkling;  a  slightly  red/orange  com-
plexion;  an  ashen,  pale,  or  gray  overall
skin  appearance;  puffiness;  and  gaunt-
ness.2,3 A prematurely older appearance
is  also  a  typical  symptom  of  chronic
smoking.  Boyd  et  al.  reported  that  yel-
low,  irregularly  thickened  skin  forms
from the breakdown of the skin’s elastic

fibers  as  a  result  of  smoking.2 In  1999,
Demierre  et  al.  noted  that  case–control
studies  and  other  reports  suggest  a
higher  prevalence  of  facial  wrinkling
among smokers and that smokers, more
often  than  nonsmokers,  appear  older
than their stated age.1 A significant asso-
ciation between smoking and gray hair
was also observed in a different study.1
A German literature review article from
the mid-1990s concluded that smoking is
at least culpable for promoting, if not actu-
ally  causing,  various  skin  changes.5 This
report  noted  the  strong  association
between cigarette smoking and yellowed
fingers  as  well  as  increased  facial  wrin-
kling, particularly in women. An elevated
incidence  of  precancerous  lesions  and
squamous cell carcinomas on lips and oral
mucosa, as well as vasospasms and deteri-
oration in large arteries and microvascula-
ture were also linked to cigarette smoking
in  this  report.  In  addition,  smoking  has
recently been shown in an observational
study  to  have  a  strong  correlation  with
androgenetic alopecia by dint of a multi-
factorial array of mechanisms.6

HIGHLIGHTS OF SOME OF 
THE MAJOR STUDIES

Results  of  a  1998  study  suggest  that
smokers do indeed incur a greater risk of
facial wrinkling and that this risk is not
mitigated  by  the  introduction  of  hor-
mone  replacement  therapy  (HRT).7 In
this study, researchers set out to exam-

ine the combined effects on the skin of a
protective  factor  (HRT)  and  a  deleteri-
ous factor (smoking) by evaluating three
different  groups  of  postmenopausal
women  differentiated  by  smoking  sta-
tus: lifelong nonsmokers, current smok-
ers,  and  former  smokers.  Results  from
direct questioning (on smoking and HRT
status)  and  standardized  visual  assess-
ment  revealed  a  relative  risk  of  moder-
ate  to  severe  wrinkling  for  current
smokers  to  be  over  twice  that  for  life-
long nonsmokers. Further, lifelong non-
smokers on HRT exhibited lower facial
wrinkle scores than lifelong nonsmokers
who had never received HRT, but HRT
had  little  general  effect  on  the  facial
wrinkle scores of current smokers.

Boyd  et  al.  echoed  these  results  in
reporting  that  women  seem  to  be  more
affected  than  men,  and  light  skin  more
than  dark  skin.  They  also  found  that
while sun exposure, age, weight change,
and social status do not appear to play a
role in cutaneous manifestations of smok-
ing, the duration and amount of smoking
are significant factors in wrinkle develop-
ment. Further, in a study by Daniel, it was
found  that  people  who  had  smoked  for
less  than  15  years  and  those  who  had
smoked less than half a pack daily were
just slightly more likely to exhibit salient
wrinkling. These individuals were far less
likely to be wrinkled than smokers of the
same  age  and  sex  who  had  smoked  a
greater amount or over a longer period of
time.8 Daniel  hypothesized  that  genetic
predisposition  may  also  play  a  role  in

 
 
 
increasing the likelihood that some smok-
ers  will  develop  facial  wrinkling.  He
stated  that  the  cutaneous  vasculature  of
those  who  develop  more  wrinkles  may
be more susceptible to damage from the
chemicals  in  tobacco  products.2 This,
however has not yet been proven.

In a 1995 cross-sectional study of 299
subjects  who  never  smoked,  551  former
smokers,  and  286  then-current  smokers,
aged 30 to 69 years, a positive association
was  observed  between  pack-years  and
facial  wrinkling  in  women  and  men
between the ages of 40 and 69 years. This
finding buttressed previous evidence that
facial  wrinkling 
is  more  prominent
among  smokers  than  people  who  have
never  smoked.9 In  1971,  Daniel  noted
much  greater  facial  wrinkling  among
smokers than nonsmokers across several
demographic  scales  (age,  sex,  and  sun-
exposure  groups),  and  concluded  that
smoking,  more  than  sun  exposure,  was
responsible  for  the  subjects’  facial  wrin-
kling.8 In a more recent study to evaluate
the  risk  of  premature  facial  wrinkling
caused  by  cigarette  smoking,  investiga-
tors considered the cigarette smoking sta-
tus, weight changes, average recreational
and  occupational  sun  exposure  in  1
month, as well as past medical and facial
cosmetic  surgery  as  identified  in  self-
questionnaires  answered  by  123  non-
smokers,  160  current  smokers,  and  67
past smokers, aged 20 to 69 years. In line
with what has emerged as the prevailing
sentiment regarding the cutaneous seque-
lae of smoking, current smokers exhibited
a  greater  degree  of  facial  wrinkling  and
average  skin  roughness  as  compared  to
nonsmokers  and  past  smokers,  even
those  past  smokers  who  had  smoked
heavily at a younger age. Notably, micro-
scopic superficial wrinkling was observed
in the facial skin of young current smok-
ers aged 20 to 39 years.10

In 1991, Kadunce et al. reported on a
study  of  132  adult  smokers  and  non-
smokers. The researchers controlled for
age,  sex,  skin  pigmentation,  and  sun
exposure and determined that sun expo-
sure  and  pack-years  of  smoking  were
independently  related  to  the  observed
prevalence  of  premature  wrinkling,
which  increased  with  increased  pack-
years  of  smoking.11 Those  individuals
considered heavy smokers (greater than
50  pack-years)  were  4.7  times  more
likely to be wrinkled as compared with
nonsmokers. The risk of excessive wrin-
kling  was  elevated  over  three-fold  for
those  subjects  with  more  than  50,000
lifetime hours of sun exposure. Kadunce
et al., unlike Daniel, identified sun expo-
sure as the greater risk factor for prema-

ture  wrinkling,  but  also  noted  a  multi-
plicative effect in subjects who smoked
and absorbed significant sun exposure.11
In  a  1999  study  of  82  smokers  who
smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day
and  118  nonsmokers  who  had  smoked
fewer  than  100  lifetime  cigarettes,
O’Hare  et  al.  found  that  smoking
accounted for only 6% of the explained
variance  after  controlling  for  solar  risk
behavior.  The  researchers  concluded
that  if  smoking  is  implicated  in  wrin-
kling,  its  role  is  minor  and  that  other
studies were unblinded or failed to con-
sider  potential  confounding  variables.12
Conversely, Smith and Fenske had pre-
viously found that the weight of the evi-
dence  suggests  that  cigarette  smoking
causes premature aging and wrinkling.3
In a British study, investigators evalu-
ated a random sample of 792 individuals
aged 60 years or older (71 was the mean
age of participants) registered with gen-
eral practitioners in Wales, UK, to ascer-
tain  the  key  etiologic  factors  in  skin
wrinkling  and  assess  the  viability  of
using  skin  wrinkling  as  an  objective
measure  of  cumulative  sun  exposure.
Researchers  gathered  data  between
1988 and 1991 during home visit inter-
views, in which subjects were asked to
estimate  their  average  outdoor  time
during  three  periods  of  life,  and  via
examination of the face, neck, and dor-
sal  hand  by  an  experienced  dermatolo-
gist. Multiple logistic regression models
revealed that chronologic age and daily
cigarette smoking were the only factors
significantly linked to visible cutaneous
aging.  In  addition,  the  effects  of  smok-
ing 20 cigarettes daily were deemed by
the investigators to equate roughly to a
decade of natural intrinsic aging.13

In a study of the effects of smoking on
wrinkling  and  aging  in  males  living  in
Northern Finland, where there is a low,
cumulative sun exposure, eight panelists
estimated  the  smoking  status,  age,  and
facial  wrinkling  of  41  smokers  and 
48 nonsmokers. Although clinical assess-
ment  and  computerized  image  analysis
revealed no significant differences in skin
wrinkling, smokers appeared older than
their age (an average of 2.1 years older)
to the panelists, who were able to iden-
tify most of the smokers based solely on
their facial features.14

In  another  study,  investigators  con-
ducting  a  literature  review  on  Medline
covering articles published from 1966 to
2004  that  pertained  to  the  cutaneous
effects of smoking found strong correla-
tions between smoking and a wide array
of  dermatologic  conditions,  including
wrinkling  and  premature  skin  aging,  as

well as poor wound healing, squamous
cell  carcinoma,  psoriasis,  hidradenitis
suppurativa, hair loss, and oral cancers.15
The same review also found that smok-
ing  affects  the  skin  lesions  associated
with AIDS, diabetes, and lupus. 

In a recent study, 82 subjects aged 22 to
91 years were assessed for the effects of
smoking  on  photoprotected  skin  of  the
inner arm. Forty-one subjects (50%) had a
history  of  previous  or  current  smoking.
Subjects were followed for 1 year and the
evaluation was based on a 9-point scale in
which 0 and 8 represented “no fine wrin-
kling” and “severe fine wrinkling,” respec-
tively. Results were studied by a multiple
regression  model  in  order  to  determine
skin aging with controlling variables such
as  chronologic  aging  and  hormone  ther-
apy.  Packs  of  cigarettes  smoked  daily
were  found  to  be  associated  with  wrin-
kling  and  to  be  a  predictive  variable  of
aging in photoprotected skin.16

SPECULATION ON ASPECTS OF 
MECHANISM OF ACTION 

Several  bodily  tissues  endure  wide-
ranging  pharmacologic  effects  from  the
over  1500 
ingredients  of  cigarette
smoke.  Although  the  clinical  trials  dis-
cussed above differed over the extent of
the impact of smoking on skin, it is cer-
tain  that  smoking  alters  skin  function
and immune-mediated skin disease.4 For
example, lower stratum corneum water
content has been reported in smokers,17
likely  because  of  the  diuretic  effect  of
nicotine.

Although  little  is  known  about  the
mechanism  through  which  cigarette
smoking manifests in facial wrinkling, the
is  probably  multifactorial.3
dynamic 
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) likely
play  a  significant  role  in  the  premature
aging  induced  by  cigarette  smoking  via
the  same  mechanism  that  MMPs  cause
aging  in  patients  with  significant  sun
exposure (see Chapter 6). A recent study
demonstrated that MMP-1 mRNA levels
are  significantly  increased  in  the  skin  of
smokers as compared to the skin of non-
smokers.18 Because MMPs are known to
degrade  collagen,  this  finding  may  help
explain the mechanism by which smok-
ing causes premature aging. Other MMPs
are  known  to  affect  elastic  fibers;  there-
fore, these MMPs likely play a role as well
because  the  elastic  fibers  in  the  skin  of
non-sun-exposed smokers appear thicker
and  more  fragmented  than  the  elastic
fibers  in  the  skin  of  nonsmoking  age-
matched  controls.  These  histopathologic
findings are similar to those seen in sun-

damaged  skin,  though  the  smoking-
induced  alterations  occur  deeper  in  the
reticular  dermis  as  opposed  to  the  solar
damage to the papillary dermis. In addi-
tion  to  the  observed  increased  levels  of
MMPs noted in the skin of smokers, there
are several other systemic and metabolic
alterations induced by smoking.

Smoking appears to reduce facial stra-
tum  corneum  moisture  as  well  as  vita-
min  A  levels,  the  latter  of  which  is
important in fending off or neutralizing
the free radicals thought to contribute to
the  etiologic  pathway  of  aging.  Of
course, genetic factors also play a role in
facial wrinkling because not all smokers
exhibit the typical “smoker’s face.”

Many  studies  discussing  the  changes
seen in the cutaneous microvasculature of
smokers  show  that  chronic  smoking
diminishes  capillary  and  arterial  blood
flow,  leading  to  local  dermal  ischemia.18
This  compromised  blood  flow  leads  to
fewer  nutrients  and  oxygen  in  the  skin
with  a  concomitant  build-up  of  toxic
waste products that can damage the skin.
In  fact,  it  is  well  known  that  smoking
slows  wound  healing  and  that  patients
are strongly advised to stop smoking prior
to any elective cosmetic surgery.19 This is
especially  important  in  face-lifts,  laser
resurfacing, and dermabrasion procedures
because a good blood supply to the skin is
vital for a good surgical outcome.

Another confounding factor in the pro-
duction of facial wrinkling is infrared radi-
ation (IR). IR comprises 40% of the solar
radiation  that  reaches  the  earth  and  has
been associated with increasing the num-
ber  and  thickness  of  elastic  fibers  in
exposed skin. The effects of IR are felt as
heat, though the cutaneous results of such
exposure  are  similar  to  the  elastosis
induced by UV exposure. This, along with
the  fact  that  several  studies  have  sug-
gested a link between exacerbated elasto-
sis  and  chronic  exposure  to  heat  in  the
workplace,  led  investigators  to  conclude
that the presence of a continuous source
of  heat  such  as  a  lit  cigarette  may  have
contributed to an increase in the elastosis
observed in their patients who smoke.19

Facial Wrinkles and Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 

Smoking is also the major risk factor for
the development of chronic obstructive
pulmonary  disease  (COPD).  Not  all
cigarette  smokers  develop  COPD;
therefore, it is believed that individuals
who develop COPD have a genetic sus-
ceptibility  to  the  effects  of  cigarette
smoke.20,21 In  2006,  researchers  found

that  smokers  with  significant  facial
wrinkles  were  more  likely  to  have
COPD.22 Collagen and elastin levels are
affected  in  both  facial  wrinkling  and
COPD, so it is possible that these condi-
tions  share  common  mechanistic  or
genetic pathways. It has been suggested
that  smokers  with  significant  facial
wrinkles should be evaluated for COPD.

TREATMENT OF SKIN AGING 
INDUCED BY SMOKING

Of course, cessation of smoking should be
the  primary  goal.  There  are  many  prod-
ucts available to help patients stop smok-
ing,  including  nicotine  patches  and  gum,
as  well  as  oral  antidepressants  such  as
ZybanTM. All patients should stop smok-
ing  at least 1 month prior to any elective
surgery  to  enhance  wound  healing.  All
cosmetic  patients  should  be  advised  that
sun  exposure  and  smoking  undermine
efforts  to  look  younger.  However,  if
patients insist on smoking, the addition of
an  oral  antioxidant  vitamin  formula  (see
Chapter  34)  and  a  topical  retinoid  (see
Chapter  30)  may  help  prevent  some  of
the  deleterious  effects  of  smoking,
although  this  has  not  been  studied  or
proven. The “smoker’s wrinkles” around
the  mouth can  be  treated  with  dermal
fillers such as CosmoPlastTM, JuvédermTM,
or RestylaneTM (see Chapter 23), or with a
very small amount of botulinum toxin (see
Chapter 22). A more permanent improve-
ment  option  for  these  patients  is  der-
mabrasion or laser resurfacing. However,
perioral  lines  will  rapidly  reappear  if  the
patient continues or resumes smoking.

SUMMARY

The preponderance of evidence suggests
that cigarette smoking contributes to the
exogenous aging of skin. Dermatologists
are  in  a  unique  position  to  appeal  to
patients’  vanity  and  to  nudge  them
toward  cessation  of  a  habit  that  poses
numerous  risks  and  likely  deleterious
effects on their health. The cosmetic der-
matologist may even have more leverage
in suggesting to patients who smoke that
continuation  or  resumption  of  smoking
can  seriously  compromise  the  efficacy 
of  any  facial  rejuvenation  procedure.
Although  there  are  many  treatments
available for aging skin, there is no treat-
ment as effective as prevention itself!

Nutrition and 
the Skin

Leslie Baumann, MD

Food is the only medicine that the aver-
age  healthy  individual  requires  on  a
daily  basis.  Indeed,  more  than  2000
years  ago,  Hippocrates  is  said  to  have
offered: “Let food be your medicine, and
let  medicine  be  your  food.”1 It  is  from
such a perspective—that good nutrition
is a fundamental building block of good
general  health  and  healthy  skin—that
this  discussion  proceeds.  Specifically,
this  chapter  will  focus  on  some  of  the
key  chemical  components  of  a  healthy
diet  that  have  been  shown  to  confer
benefits to the skin. In the process, cuta-
neous  effects  will  be  discussed  in  the
context of vegetarianism, as well as the
skin types of the Baumann Skin Typing
System.  Attention  will  first  be  focused
on the effects of diet on acne, the most
common  dermatologic  condition,  and,
finally, on oral supplementation.

There  is  copious  research  underway
now on the direct effects on health from
the consumption or supplementation of
various  nutrients.  A  significant  propor-
tion  of  such  work  focuses  specifically
on  the  potential  benefits  conferred  to
the  skin  through  the  intake  of  certain
foods  or  supplements.  For  instance,  in
2003,  a  cross-sectional  study  of  302
healthy  men  and women collected data
on  serum  concentrations  of  nutrients,
dietary  consumption  of  nutrients,  as
well as various cutaneous measurements
(including hydration, sebum content, and
surface pH), revealing statistically signifi-
cant relationships between serum vitamin
A and cutaneous sebum content as well as
surface pH as well as between skin hydra-
tion and dietary consumption of total fat,
saturated fat, and monosaturated fat. The
investigators concluded that such findings
are evidence that the condition of the skin
can be influenced by alterations in base-
line nutritional status.2

DIET AND ACNE

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common
conditions that prompt visits to a derma-
tologist.  In  1998,  it  was  believed  that
acne affected as many as 40 to 50 million
people in the United States alone.3 More

(i.e., 

recently,  estimates  of  acne  prevalence
and  incidence  in  Western  populations,
while remaining high, have come closer
to 17 million in the United States4,5 (see
Chapter  15).  Interestingly,  recent  epi-
demiologic  studies  in  non-Westernized
populations 
Inuit,  Okinawan
Islanders,  Ache  hunter-gatherers,  and
Kitavan Islanders) in which acne is rare,
indicate  that  dietary  factors,  including
glycemic  load,  may  play  a  role  in  the
development  of  this  condition,  particu-
larly since incidence of acne has risen in
these  communities  in  association  with
the adoption of Western lifestyles.6–9

Accordingly, Cordain, has argued per-
suasively for abandoning the traditional
belief  espoused  in  the  dermatology
community  since  the  early  1970s  that
diet  does  not  contribute  to  the  patho-
physiology  of  acne.  In  particular,  he
asserts that the dogma claiming that diet
and  acne  are  unrelated  has  been  based
on  two  fundamentally  flawed  studies
from 1969 by Fulton et al. and 1971 by
Anderson  that  lacked  control  groups,
statistical  data  treatment,  as  well  as
blinding and/or placebos and were char-
acterized  by  inadequate  sample  sizes
and  insufficient  or  absent  baseline  diet
data,  among  other  deficiencies.6,10,11
Furthermore,  Cordain  contends  that
substantial  evidence  has  been  amassed
since  these  two  influential  studies
revealing  that  alterations  in  hormonal
and  cytokine  homeostasis  engendered
by diet have emerged as the leading can-
didates  for  exogenous  influences  on
acne development. Among such data is a
study  suggesting  that  the  regular,  long-
term  consumption  of  high  glycemic
meals,  which  raise  insulin  concentra-
tions,  may  induce  chronic  hyperinsu-
linemia and insulin resistance, increasing
levels  of  insulin-like  growth  factor  1
(IGF-1) and decreasing levels of insulin-
like  growth  factor  binding  protein  3
(IGFBP-3),  fostering  keratinocyte  prolif-
eration  and  corneocyte  apoptosis.6,12,13
Other proximate causes of acne, such as
androgen-mediated  sebum  production
levels  as  well  as  inflammation,  are  also
affected  by  diet.  Cordain  notes  that
insulin and IGF-1 incite the synthesis of
androgens as well as sebum and inhibit
the hepatic production of sex hormone-
binding globulin, resulting in higher lev-
els of circulating androgens.6

In 2007, Smith et al. investigated the
effects  of  a  low-glycemic-load  diet  on
acne lesion counts in 43 males between
the ages of 15 and 25 years. The experi-

mental  diet,  over  the  12-week,  parallel
design  study  with  investigator-blinded
skin  evaluations,  included  25%  energy
from  protein  and  45%  from  low-
glycemic-index  carbohydrates  and  the
control  group  diet  focused  on  carbohy-
drate-rich  foods  without  regard  to  the
glycemic  index.  The  low-glycemic-load
participants  experienced  larger  reduc-
tions  in  the  number  of  acne  lesions,
weight,  and  body  mass  index  and  a
greater improvement in insulin sensitiv-
ity than the subjects consuming the con-
trol  diet.14
In  the  same  cohort  of
patients, Smith et al. also compared the
impacts  from  an  experimental  low-
glycemic-load  diet  with  those  from  a
conventional high-glycemic-load diet on
acne.  Subjects  following  the  interven-
tion diet, which included recommenda-
tions  to  eat  more  fish,  exhibited  lower
lesion  counts  than  the  high-glycemic
control group after 12 weeks, and expe-
rienced greater reductions in weight and
free  androgen  index  in  addition  to
elevated insulin-like growth factor bind-
ing  protein-1  as  compared  to  controls.
While  calling  for  additional  research, 
the  investigators  concluded  that  these
findings reflect an active role in acne eti-
ology  of  nutritional  choices.15 While
accepting this overarching argument by
Smith  and  colleagues,  Logan  suggested
in  response  that  aspects  other  than  a
low-glycemic index in the experimental
diet,  particularly  its  status  as  being
lower in saturated fats as well as much
higher in polyunsaturated fats and fiber,
may  account  for  hormonal  alterations
and inflammation that affect acne.16 He
added that greater consumption of fish,
which 
anti-inflammatory
omega-3 fatty acids, may have rendered
the  intervention  diet  higher  in  polyun-
saturated fats and had a mitigating effect
on acne. To further this work by Smith
et  al.,  Logan  recommended  research
using  high-fiber,  high-omega-3  fatty
acid, and low saturated-fat diets.

contains 

Such  concerns  were  at  least  partially
answered  by  a  more  recent  report  by
Smith et al.  An investigation using data
on the same patients revealed a correla-
tion  between  an  elevated  ratio  of  satu-
rated to monounsaturated fatty acids of
skin surface triglycerides and decreased
acne lesion counts in the low-glycemic-
load diet group as compared to controls
after 12 weeks. An increase in monoun-
saturated  fatty  acids  in  sebum  was  also
associated with greater sebum secretions.
The  authors  concluded  that  desaturase

enzymes  may 
influence  sebaceous
lipogenesis  and  the  emergence  of  acne,
but suggest that more research is neces-
sary  on  the  interplay  of  sebum  gland
physiology and diet.17 While additional
research,  particularly  well  controlled
dietary  intervention  trials,  is  warranted
and  may  prove  revelatory  in  clarifying
the  contributory  roles  of  specific  foods
in  the  etiologic  pathway  of  acne,
Cordain  identifies  increased  consump-
tion  of  foods  high  in  omega-3  polyun-
saturated  fatty  acids  (PUFAs),  thus
reducing the ratio of omega-6 to omega-
3  fatty  acids,  as  important  in  attacking
the inflammatory aspect of acne.6

Acne and Milk

The possibility of an association between
dietary  consumption  of  dairy  products
and  acne  has  been  long  considered,
though it has largely been overwhelmed
by  the  dogma  of  the  last  few  decades
denying a connection between diet and
acne eruptions.

In  an  assessment  of  Nurses  Health
Study  II  data  of  47,355  women  who
completed  questionnaires  on  high
school  diet  in  1998  and  teenage  acne
diagnosed  by  a  physician  as  severe  in
1989,  Adebamowo  et  al.  identified  a
positive relation between acne and con-
sumption  of  total  milk  and  skim  milk,
which  they  speculated  might  be  attrib-
uted  to  the  hormones  and  bioactive
molecules present in milk.18 In a critical
response  to  this  article,  Bershad  ques-
tioned  the  retrospective  nature  of  the
study, namely the accuracy of distantly
recalled  dietary  habits.  In  addition,  she
suggested that the authors failed to con-
trol  for  the  subjects’  heredity,  national-
ity, and socioeconomic status, and erred
in  ascribing  a  correlation  to  causation.
Finally,  she  concluded  that  the  most
notable result of this study was not the
purported  link  between  milk  consump-
tion and acne, but the finding that acne
is not caused by pizza, French fries, and
sweets.19 In  a  rebuttal,  Adebamowo
countered that the study population was
similar socioeconomically by dint of job
similarity. Furthermore, the study popu-
lation comprised nurses of which 91.6%
were non-Hispanic white women resid-
ing in the 14 most populous US states in
1989.  While  stipulating  that  socioeco-
nomic  status  is  a  risk  factor  for  acne
development,7 he noted that accounting
for race and socioeconomic status in the
study models did not significantly alter
the  study  results.  Adebamowo  added
that the methods of his team were well
validated,20 and  that  their  findings  of  a

positive relationship between milk con-
sumption  and  acne  and  no  observed
association  between  certain  foods  and
acne warrant further investigation.19

In  2006,  Adebamowo  et  al.  reported
results  of  a  prospective  cohort  study
demonstrating  a  link  between  milk
intake  and  acne  in  6094  girls.  The  sub-
jects were 9 to 15 years old in 1996, when
they  reported  milk  consumption  on  as
many as three food frequency question-
naires from 1996 to 1998. In 1999, ques-
tionnaires were used to evaluate the pres-
ence  and  severity  of  acne.  Again,  they
discerned a positive relationship between
milk  consumption  and  acne  develop-
ment, ascribing such cutaneous results to
the metabolic effects of milk.21

More recently, Adebamowo et al., fol-
lowing  a  prospective  cohort  study  of
4273 boys who also responded to dietary
intake questionnaires from 1996 to 1998
and  a  teenaged  acne  questionnaire  in
1999,  reported  a  positive  association
between the consumption of skim milk
and  acne.  The  authors  attributed  these
findings  to  hormonal  components  in
skim milk, or factors that affect endoge-
nous hormones.22 Danby, a coauthor of
Adebamowo  on  these  studies,  while
acknowledging  the  unnatural  aspect  of
humans,  particularly  in  postweaned
years,  consuming  copious  amounts  of
another species’ milk, has suggested that
qualitative  and  quantitative  research  is
necessary  to  ascertain  the  influence  on
acne  pathogenesis  of  steroid  hormones
in all dairy products.23 He also noted that
Perricone’s  acne  prescription  diet  is
nearly devoid of dairy products,23 and, in
fact,  focuses  heavily  on  anti-inflamma-
tory food ingredients and maintaining a
low-glycemic  load.24 This  may  explain
the  success  of  Perricone’s  diet  for  the
skin.

Acne and Iodine

In 1961, Hitch and Greenburg disproved
the  notion  of  a  direct  causal  connection
between  acne  and  iodine  intake  as  the
largest  quantities  of  fish  and  other
seafood  were  consumed  by  adolescents
who  exhibited  the  lowest  acne  rates  in
their study.25 However, in 1967, Hitch did
establish  that  iodine  consumption  can
aggravate  acne.26 In  response  to  the
Adebamowo  et  al.  study  on  an  associa-
tion  between  dairy  intake  during  high
school  and  teenaged  acne  cited  above,
Arbesman indicated that the iodine con-
tent of milk may have also contributed to
acne development in addition to the hor-
monal  explanation  proffered  by  the 
investigators.27 He added that significant

levels  of  iodine  have  been  identified  in
milk  in  Denmark,  Italy,  Norway,  the
United  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States,
because of the use of iodine and iodophor
at  various  stages  of  the  production
process, with variable levels of iodine in
milk based on geography and season.28–34
In a reply to Arbesman, Danby coun-
ters  that  iodine  deficiency  poses  a
greater health risk than overdosage, and
that  iodine  levels  in  milk  appear  to  be
comparable  to  those  found  in  human
mother’s milk. Furthermore, he suggests
that  there  are  no  data  to  uphold  the
notion that comedonal acne is caused by
the  ingestion  of  iodides.35 The  author
has  not  observed  an  association
between acne and iodine, either causally
or  as  an  exacerbating  factor,  but  notes
that Fulton, primary author of the 1969
study criticized by Cordain, argues that
in  individuals  prone  to  acne,  iodine
excreted  through  the  sebaceous  glands
may in the process irritate the piloseba-
ceous unit and contribute to a flare-up.

Acne and Chocolate
While  Cordain  and  others1 have
exposed the flaws in the methodologies
of  the  studies  that  denied  a  significant
link between nutrition and acne, partic-
ularly  the  study  by  Fulton  et  al.  that
refuted a connection between chocolate
and  acne,  such  debunking  has  not
undermined  the  basic  truth  happened
upon more than 30 years ago regarding
acne and chocolate. Cordain pointed out
that the actual treatment variable in the
Fulton  study  was  an  ingredient  of  the
tested  bittersweet  chocolate  candy  bar,
cacao solids, which were replaced with
partially  hydrogenated  vegetable  fat  in
the  control  bar.  While  suggesting  that
the only logical conclusion of this study
was  that  cacao  solids  may  not  con-
tribute to the causal pathway of acne, he
also noted, among other criticisms, that
because  subjects  also  consumed  their
normal diets in addition to the 112-g test
or control bar daily for 4 weeks with no
baseline  measurements,  there  was  no
way  of  determining  the  quantity  of
cacao  solids  consumed  in  either  arm  of
the study.6 Indeed, it is likely that it is the
sugar that is added to various chocolate
delicacies  that  engenders  multiple  dele-
terious  health  effects  if  consumed  with
regularity and over time, not the cacao or
chocolate  ingredient.  Evidence  suggests
that sugar and sugar products may pro-
mote such cutaneous effects through the
glycosylation of proteins in the skin,36,37
ultimately leading to skin wrinkling and
photoaging  (see  Chapters. 2  and  19).

Interestingly,  rather  than  serving  as  a
culprit  in  acne  pathogenesis,  chocolate
has  a  history  dating  back  at  least  since
the 1500s as a component in the medical
practices of the Olmec, Maya, and Aztec
peoples.38

Not  only  does  chocolate  per  se  not
directly cause acne (though a steady diet
of  highly-sugared  chocolate  products
can certainly contribute to it), the Borba
product  line  now  includes  a  Clarifying
Chocolate  Bar  made  with  Swiss  dark
chocolate that is touted for its patented
formula that is said to have the opposite
effect on skin—actually clearing skin or
preventing  breakouts.  Of  course,  a
healthy dose of skepticism regarding the
potential contributory effects of a partic-
ular  food  toward  acne  is  just  as  appro-
priate toward the notion of consuming a
supposedly  healthier  item  to  exert  the
opposite  effect.  A  consistent  pattern  of
good  nutrition  is  likely  the  optimal
choice for overall health, total cutaneous
health, and reducing the risk of develop-
ing acne. It has long been known that a
diet rich in fruits and vegetables is ideal.
in  recent
Much  has  been 
decades, though, regarding the chemical
constituents in such foods that may play
direct  roles  in  health,  including  the
health of the skin. The beneficial activi-
ties exhibited by certain chemical ingre-
dients in foods have, in turn, been har-
nessed  in  various  medications  to  exert
more  direct  effects.  For 
instance,
retinoids are a form of vitamin A, which
has  long  been  known  to  play  a  role  in
acne.  Notably,  carotenoids  are  one  of
the best dietary sources of vitamin A.

CAROTENOIDS

Certain  plant  constituents  have  been
established  as  exerting  photoprotective
effects as antioxidants, including carote-
noids,  flavonoids  and  other  polyphe-
nols,  tocopherols,  and  vitamin  C.  In  a
recent  study,  Stahl  et  al.  demonstrated
that consumption of lycopene, which is
the primary carotenoid in tomatoes and
is also present in apricots, papaya, pink
grapefruit, guava, and watermelon, was
effective 
in  preventing  or  curbing
sensitivity  to  ultraviolet  (UV)-induced
erythema  formation  in  volunteers  con-
suming  lycopene-rich  products  over  10
to 12 weeks.39

Stahl  et  al.  previously  investigated
whether the use of dietary tomato paste,
a rich source of lycopene, could deliver a
protective  effect  against  UV-induced
erythema  in  humans.  A  solar  simulator
was  used  to  induce  erythema  in  the
scapular area at the outset of the study

and after weeks 4 and 10. For a period of
10 weeks, 9 volunteers ingested 40 g of
tomato paste with 10 g of olive oil while
10  controls  ingested  olive  oil  only.
levels  were  equivalent
Carotenoid 
between  the  two  groups  at  the  begin-
ning of the study and there were no sig-
nificant differences between the groups
at week 4. There was neither change in
serum  carotenoids  in  the  control  group
by week 10 nor in other carotenoids but
lycopene in the experimental group, but
those  consuming  tomato  paste  exhib-
ited  higher  serum  levels  of  lycopene

In

(16  mg/d)  for  10  weeks,  Stahl  and  Sies
demonstrated  similar  results,  with
increases  measured  in  serum  levels  of
lycopene  and  total  carotenoids  in  skin
and  significantly  less  erythema  forma-
tion  after  10  weeks.  They  also  deter-
mined  that  there  is  an  optimal  level  of

In  a  placebo-controlled,  parallel  study
involving some of the same investigators,
the protective effects against erythema of
beta-carotene  (24  mg/d)  were  compared
to those of the same dose of a carotenoid
combination of beta-carotene, lutein, and
lycopene  (8  mg/d  each)  or  placebo  for 
12 weeks. Erythema intensity before and
24 hours after irradiation with a solar light
simulator  was  recorded  at  baseline  and
following 6 and 12 weeks of supplemen-
tation.  Researchers  noted  diminished
intensity in erythema 24 hours after expo-
sure (at weeks 6 and 12) in both experi-
mental  groups,  with  substantially  less
erythema  formation  after  12  weeks  in
comparison to baseline. While there were
no observed changes in the control group,
serum carotenoid levels increased signifi-
cantly also, three- to four-fold in the beta-
carotene group and one- to three-fold in
the mixed carotenoid group.42 In a more

recent study by several of the same inves-
tigators,  the  photoprotective  effects  of
synthetic lycopene were compared to the
effects  of  a  tomato  extract  (Lyc-o-Mato)
and  a  beverage  containing  solubilized
Lyc-o-Mato (Lyc-o-Guard-Drink) after 12
weeks  of  supplementation.  Significant
increases  were  observed  in  all  groups  in
terms  of  serum  levels  of  lycopene  and
total  skin  carotenoids  and  a  protective
effect  against  erythema  formation  was
seen  in  all  groups  as  well,  but  it  was
substantially  larger  in  the  Lyco-o-Mato
and Lyc-o-Guard groups. The researchers
speculated  that  the  carotenoid  phyto-
fluene and carotenoid precursor phytoene
may have assisted in providing this addi-
tional photoprotection.43

Finally, lutein and zeaxanthin, found in
leafy  green  vegetables,  were  supple-
mented for 2 weeks in the diets of female
hairless  Skh-1  mice  to  determine  the
cutaneous response to UVB. Investigators
observed  significant  reductions  in  the
edematous cutaneous response as well as
decreases  in  the  UVB-induced  elevation
in hyperproliferative markers.44

POLYPHENOLS

Comprising  a  broad  range  of  more 
than  8000  naturally-occurring  com-
pounds, polyphenols are secondary plant
metabolites that exert varying degrees of
antioxidant activity. All of these diverse
substances  share  a  definitive  structural
component, a phenol or an aromatic ring
with  at  least  one  hydroxyl  group.
Polyphenols  are  an  exceedingly  impor-
tant  part  of,  and  the  most  copious
antioxidants  in,  the  human  diet,  and
found  in  a  vast  spectrum  of  vegetables,
fruits,  herbs,  grains,  tea,  coffee  beans,
propolis,  and  red  wine45,46 (Table  8-1).
Flavonoids  are  the  most  abundant
polyphenols in the human diet as well as
the  most  studied  polyphenols,  and  can
be  further  divided  into  several  cate-
gories. These subclasses include flavones

(e.g., resveratrol, found in red wine), lig-

and  flaxseed  oil),  tannins  (e.g.,  ellagic

strawberries,  cranberries,  and  walnuts),
hydroxycinnamic  acids,  and  phenolic
acids,  among  which  caffeic  and  ferulic
acids  are  frequently  found  in  foods.  A
survey  of  the  research  associated  with
many  of  these  compounds  and  their
sources is beyond the scope of this chap-
ter,  as  such  a  discussion  could  fill  vol-
umes. Some of the most widely dissemi-
nated  results  involving  polyphenols
pertain to the identified efficacy of vari-
ous topical applications of green tea cat-
echins, ferulic acid, resveratrol, and other
ingredients,  which  are  discussed  else-
where in this textbook.

ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS AND
VEGETARIAN/VEGAN DIETS

researchers 

identified  a 

Nearly 25 years ago, investigators mea-
sured  the  omega-6  and  omega-3  fatty
acids  (also  known  as  n-6  and  n-3  fatty
acids, respectively) in the plasma phos-
pholipids  of  41  adults  with  atopic
eczema  and  50  normal  controls  and
found the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) to
be  significantly  elevated,  with  all  of  its
metabolites  likewise  reduced,  and  the
omega-3  (cid:2)-linolenic  acid  (ALA)  ele-
vated,  but  not  significantly,  with  all  of
its  metabolites  substantially  decreased.
The 
link
between  atopic  eczema  and  abnormal
metabolism.  Oral  evening  primrose  oil
(EPO)  treatment  partly  rectified  the
abnormal  metabolism  of  omega-6,  but
levels.50
did  not 
alter  omega-3 
Subsequently,  Galland  noted  data  indi-
cating  an  association  between  poor
desaturation  of  linoleic  and  linolenic
acids  by  delta-6  dehydrogenase  and
atopic eczema and other allergic condi-
tions, as well as the alleviation of atopic
eczema symptoms through dietary sup-
plementation  with  essential 
fatty
acids.51 Twenty years ago, investigators
conducting  a  12-week,  double-blind
study  of  the  effects  of  dietary  supple-
mentation  with  n-3  fatty  acids  in
patients  with  atopic  dermatitis  found
that  the  experimental  group  taking
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) experienced
overall less subjective severity and pruri-
tus  than  the  control  group  taking  a
placebo.52 It  appears  that  supplementa-
tion with n-3 fatty acids may ameliorate
symptoms of eczema in the short term.
Notably,  levels  of  n-3  fatty  acids  are
depressed  in  vegetarians  and  vegans.

Not all physicians embrace the utility of
dietary  modifications  in  the  treatment
of  eczema.  Of  course,  patient  recom-
mendations  should  include  advice  on
bathing  and  skin  moisturization  (see
Chapters  11  and  32)  as  well  as  dietary
recommendations.

The  dietary  research  in  the  1980s
helped  form  the  theoretical  framework
that  undergirds  current  studies  of  suit-
able  sources  for  adjunct  or  alternative
therapies  for  atopic  eczema,  such  as
hemp seed oil (which is rich in omega-6
and  omega-3  fatty  acids),53 EPO,54 and
borage  oil,55 as  well  as  the  significance
of varying levels of essential fatty acids
for individuals with vegetarian or vegan
diets as compared to omnivores.

An examination over a decade ago of
lipid metabolism in 81 healthy lacto- and
lacto-ovovegetarians and 62 nonvegetar-
ians  buttressed  previous  studies  that
revealed higher total serum polyunsatu-
rated  acid  concentrations,  particularly
linoleic and linolenic acids, in vegetarians
compared to nonvegetarians. Significant-
ly  higher  plasma  levels  of  vitamin  C,
beta-carotene,  and  selenium  as  well  as
vitamin  E-to-cholesterol  and  vitamin  E-
to-triacylglycerol  ratios  (indicators  of
LDL  and  fatty  acid  protection,  respec-
tively)  were  observed.56 (See  Table  8-3
for  a  summary  of  potential  nutritional
deficits according to diet style.)

and 

In  an  interesting  matched-pair  study
two  decades  ago,  Melchert  et  al.  com-
pared  serum  fatty  acid  content  in  108
vegetarians  (62  females,  40  males)  and
108  nonvegetarians  (70  females,  38
males).  Palmitoleic  (omega-7),  vaccenic
(omega-7), 
docosahexaenoic
(omega-3) acids were higher in nonvege-
tarians, and very low in vegetarians, and
vegetarians  exhibited  higher  levels  of
LA.57 More  supportive  evidence  was
established  in  a  study  of  essential  fatty
acids  and  lipoprotein  lipids  in  female
Australian  vegetarians  and  omnivores,
as investigators found that the vegetari-
ans had significantly lower levels of n-6
and n-3 PUFAs and a lower ratio of n-3
to  n-6  PUFAs.58 It  is  also  important  to

note,  PUFAs  are  known  to  inhibit  the
synthesis  of  eicosanoids  derived  from
arachidonic  acid,  and  are  thus  effective
against allergic diseases.59

More  recently,  Davis  and  Kris-
Etherton have indicated that vegetarian,
particularly  vegan,  diets  have  been
shown  to  deliver  lower  levels  of  ALA
than LA, and especially low, if any, levels
of  EPA  and  docosahexaenoic  acid
(DHA), resulting in lower tissue levels of
long-chain  n-3  fatty  acids.  Given  such
low EPA and DHA levels as well as the
inefficient  conversion  of  ALA  to  the
more  active  longer-chain  metabolites
EPA and DHA, they suggest that vegetar-
ians  may  exhibit  a  greater  dependence
on  ALA  conversion  to  its  metabolites
and a corresponding greater need for n-3
acids  than  nonvegetarians.60 In  2005,
investigators conducted a cross-sectional
study  of  196  omnivore,  231  vegetarian,
and  232  vegan  men  in  the  United
Kingdom  to  compare  plasma  fatty  acid
concentrations in order to ascertain if the
proportions  of  EPA,  docosapentaenoic
acid  (DPA),  and  DHA  relied  on  strict
dietary  adherence  (data  on  which  was
obtained  through  a  questionnaire)  or  to
the  proportions  of  LA  and  ALA  in
plasma.  While  only  minor  differences
were observed in DPA levels, investiga-
tors noted reduced EPA and DHA levels
in  vegetarians  and  vegans,  whose  DHA
levels  were  inversely  correlated  with
plasma LA. Interestingly, they found that
duration  of  adherence  to  dietary  regi-
mens  was  not  significantly  related  to
plasma  n-3  levels.  The  researchers  sug-
gested that the endogenous synthesis of
EPA and DHA is low but yields stable n-
3  plasma  levels  in  individuals  whose
diets exclude animal foods.61 Such find-
ings  support  the  notion  of  vegetarian/
vegan diets providing sufficient n-3 fatty
acid concentration for survival. To opti-
mize  cutaneous  health  and  appearance,
though,  vegetarians  and  vegans  may

benefit  from  adding  supplemental  EPA
and  DHA.  It  is  worth  noting  that  topi-
cally applied EPA has also been found to
exert  photoprotective  and  antiaging
effects to the skin.62

Vegetarians Versus Nonvegetarians

As stated previously, vegetarians exhibit
lower levels of serum cholesterol, ALA,
EPA,  and  DHA  and  higher  levels  of
antioxidants  than  nonvegetarians.  (For
example,  a  study  of  vegetarians  esti-
mated lipid parameters in four different
groups of vegetarians, and noted higher
levels  of  vitamin  C  in  the  blood  of  all
four groups.63) Furthermore, individuals
on  a  vegan  diet  for  an  extended  period
may have little to no serum cholesterol.
Vegans also tend to have drier skin than
vegetarians.

The main dietary fat should be derived
from foods and oils rich in monounsatu-
rated  fat.  When  monounsaturated  fats
predominate,  saturated  fats,  trans-fatty
acids, and n-6 fatty acids are counterbal-
anced,  and  the  ratio  of  n-6  to  n-3  fatty
acids  improves  as  the  proportion  of
omega-3 acids increases. Nuts (except for
walnuts  and  butternuts),  peanuts  (a
legume),  olive  oil,  olives,  avocados,
canola  oil,  high-oleic  sunflower  oil,  and
high-oleic safflower oil all contain appre-
ciable  levels  of  monounsaturated  fats.
(See  Table  8-4 for  a  summary  of  foods
that may have an impact in ameliorating
dry skin.) Monounsaturated fats are bet-
ter  to  consume  through  whole  foods  as
compared  to  oils,  or  supplements,
because  whole  foods  deliver  several
other nutrients to the diet. Certain seeds,
nuts,  and  legumes  (flaxseed,  hempseed,
canola, walnuts, and soy) as well as the
green  leaves  of  plants,  including  phyto-
plankton  and  algae,  are  the  primary
sources of dietary ALA. As stated above,
fish,  fish  oil,  and  seafood  are  the  best
sources  of  dietary  EPA  and  DHA.  For

lacto-ovovegetarians,  eggs  provide  an
adequate amount of DHA ((cid:11)50 mg/egg)
but  minimal  EPA.  Microalgae  and  sea-
weed are the only plant sources of long-
chain n-3 fatty acids.

Although  vegetarian  diets  are  gener-
ally lower in total fat, saturated fat, and
cholesterol  compared  to  nonvegetarian
diets,  they  deliver  comparable  levels  of
essential  fatty  acids.  Clinical  studies
have  shown  that  tissue  levels  of  long-
chain  n-3  fatty  acids  are  typically
depressed in vegetarians, particularly so
in  vegans.  However,  vegetarians  con-
sume approximately one-third less satu-
rated  fat  (vegans  approximately  one-
half)  and  approximately  one-half  as
much  cholesterol  (vegans  consume
none) as omnivores.60

EPA/DHA, Immunoresponse 
and Psoriasis

DHA has been shown to inhibit inflam-
mation  and  immunoresponses  in  the
contact hypersensitivity reaction in mice.
Investigators fed dietary DHA as well as
EPA to mice sensitized with 2,4-dinitro-
1-fluorobenzene.  They  found  that  24
hours  after  the  contact  hypersensitivity
challenge,  ear  swelling  was  reduced  by
DHA ethyl ester, but not EPA ethyl ester.
DHA  also  diminished  the  infiltration  of
CD4+ T  lymphocytes  into  the  ears,  and
minimized  the  expression  of  interferon-
gamma,  interleukin  (IL)-6,  IL-1beta,  and
IL-2  mRNA  in  the  ears.  The  researchers
concluded  that  the  immunosuppressive
activity associated with fish oil should be
ascribed  primarily  to  DHA  and  not  its
fellow  n-3  PUFA.64 However,  in  clinical
trials,  EPA  and  DHA  in  fish  oils  have,
combined with medication, been shown

to ameliorate the skin lesions, reduce the
hyperlipidemia  caused  by  etretinates
(which were removed from the Canadian
market  in  1996  and  the  US  market  in
1998  because  of  elevated  risks  of  birth
defects),  and  lower  cyclosporin  toxicity
in patients with psoriasis.65 Furthermore,
in  a  14-day  double-blind,  randomized,
parallel group multicenter study in which
83  patients  hospitalized  for  chronic
plaque-type  psoriasis  (with  a  Psoriasis
Area and Severity Index [PASI] score of at
least  15)  were  randomized  to  receive
daily intravenous administration of either
an  omega-3  fatty  acid-based  lipid  emul-
sion or an omega-6 emulsion, investiga-
tors  observed  greater  improvements  in
the  omega-3  group  in  terms  of  dimin-
ished  psoriasis  severity,  which  was
echoed  by  patient  self-assessment.  The
researchers  concluded 
that  chronic
plaque-type psoriasis could be effectively
treated  with  intravenous  omega-3  fatty
acids.66

MATCHING DIETARY NEEDS 
WITH SKIN TYPE

The  Baumann  Skin  Typing  System
(BSTS),  introduced  in  The  Skin  Type
Solution (Bantam  2005),  is  a  novel
approach  to  classifying  skin  type  (see
Chapter  9).  The  BSTS  score,  derived
from  a  self-administered  questionnaire,
is based on the understanding that skin
can be assessed according to four major
parameters: oily versus dry (O/D), sensi-
tive  versus  resistant  (S/R),  pigmented
versus  nonpigmented  (P/N),  and  wrin-
kled  versus  tight  (W/T).  Sixteen  differ-
ent skin type permutations are possible.
The  discussion  of  dietary  needs  based
on  skin  type  proceeds  according  to  the
four major parameters. The center of the
spectrum is ideal for both the O/D and
S/R  parameters.  Dietary  interventions
appear to be possible to render skin less
oily or dry, as well as less sensitive, but
not less resistant. Sensitive skin will be
discussed  briefly  in  “the  OSNW  Skin
Type”  section  below,  but  primarily  in
the context of comparing vegetarian and
nonvegetarian  diets  and  nutritional
approaches  to  curbing  inflammation,
which is a fundamental presentation of
all  sensitive  skin  subtypes.  Regarding
the P/N and W/T parameters, the N and
T  poles  are  the  ideals.  While  various
photoprotective  behaviors  are  recom-
mended  to  achieve  these  ends,  particu-
larly regarding the W/T spectrum, there
appear  to  be  dietary  interventions  that
will  promote  or  support  these  skin
types.

Dry Skin

Fifteen  years  ago,  investigators  studied
79 vegetarians (51 females, 28 males) and
79 age- and sex-matched nonvegetarians
to assess the relative antioxidant/athero-
genic risks. Plasma alpha-tocopherol and
corresponding  cholesterol  values  were
found  to  be  significantly  lower  in  the
vegetarians as was their risk for athero-
sclerosis, but their tocopherol-to-choles-
terol  molar  ratio  was  significantly
increased.67 Such  results  explain  the
higher incidence of dry skin in vegetari-
ans.  Cholesterol  is  an  important  sub-
stance  in  maintaining  a  balance  in  the
oily–dry continuum. With more vitamin
E  and  less  cholesterol,  vegetarians  are
more  likely  to  experience  dry  skin  (see
Chapters 11 and 32).

In a 6-week study of the mechanisms
and  efficacy  of  n-3  PUFA  for  the  treat-
ment of atopic dermatitis (AD), investi-
gators administered various formulas of
ALA  in  NC/Nga  mice  with  AD,  and
found  that  concentrations  of  n-3  fatty
acids  increased  and  n-6  fatty  acids
decreased  in  the  red  blood  cell  mem-
branes,  prostaglandin  E(2)  production
was decreased, and skin blood flow was
altered,  increasing  in  the  ear  of  mice
treated  with  the  highest  dose  of  ALA.
The  researchers,  noted,  however,  that
AD development was not prevented.59

Oily Skin Types

In the adjusted models of the cross-sec-
tional  study  of  302  healthy  men  and
women  cited  above,  serum  vitamin  A
acted  as  a  predictor  of  sebum  content
and  surface  pH,  with  a  higher  level  of
vitamin  A  associated  with  a  lower
sebum level.2 Such findings suggest that
individuals with oily skin would benefit
from  eating  foods  rich  in  vitamin  A.
Indeed,  dietary  consumption  of  plants
and fish oil, high in PUFAs, is thought to
be  useful  in  treating  inflammatory  skin
conditions because PUFAs are known to
inhibit  lipid  inflammatory  mediators68
(see Chapter 10).

The OSNW Skin Type

Each  of  the  Baumann  Skin  Types  has
specific  dietary  needs.  Because  of
space constraints, each of the diets for
the 16 Baumann Skin Types cannot be
discussed here. However, as an exam-
ple  of  the  utility  in  knowing  the
patient’s Baumann Skin Type, the oily,
sensitive,  nonpigmented,  wrinkled
(OSNW)  skin  type  will  be  briefly  dis-
cussed. Individuals with OSNW skin are
at  an  increased  risk  of  developing  non-

melanoma  skin  cancer  (basal  cell  or
squamous  cell  carcinoma).  The  dietary
guidelines  that  the  author  suggests  for
such patients to help them reduce cuta-
neous inflammation as well as the pro-
clivity to wrinkle may also help decrease
their  risk  for  skin  cancer,  though.69
Generally,  the  diet  for  individuals  with
OSNW skin should be focused on inhibit-
ing  oil  secretion,  decreasing  inflamma-
tion,  and  preventing  photodamage  and
skin cancer.

Dietary  vitamin  A  has  been  demon-
strated  to  exhibit  an  association  with
reduced oil gland secretion.2 Therefore, a
diet rich in foods that contain vitamin A,
such  as  cantaloupe,  carrots,  dried  apri-
cots, egg yolks, liver, mangoes, spinach,
and  sweet  potatoes,  is  recommended.
Several foods have also long been forti-
fied  with  vitamin  A,  including  milk,
some  margarine,  instant  oats,  breakfast
cereals,  and  meal  replacement  bars.  In
addition, carotenoids, which can be con-
verted into vitamin A, have been demon-
strated  to  exhibit  inhibitory  activity
against  skin  cancer.70 Two  of  the  most
protective  carotenoids  are  lycopene,
found  abundantly  in  tomatoes,  and
lutein, found especially in spinach, kale,
and  broccoli.71,72 A  diet  rich  in  other
antioxidants, in addition to carotenoids,
is  also  recommended,  including  a  wide
variety  of  fruits,  vegetables,  and  green
tea.  Antioxidants  have  been  demon-
strated to help reduce the production of
free  radicals  and  destructive  enzymes
that  promote  skin  aging.  In  addition,
olive oil has been shown to exhibit pro-
tective  properties,  especially  imported
extra virgin olive oil.73

A diet rich in fish and fish oils is also
recommended  for  OSNWs,  due  to  the
high level of omega-3 fatty acids found
in  such  food  sources.  As  stated  previ-
ously,  omega-3  fatty  acids  appear  to
confer  some  anticancer  and  anti-
inflammatory  effects.64,69 Because  vege-
tarians,  particularly  vegans,  have  been
shown  to  manifest  low  levels  of  serum
omega-3 fatty acids,60 vegetarian or vegan
OSNWs should try to add seaweed, one
of the best plant sources of omega-3 fatty
acids, to their diet. (As stated previously,
though, vegetarians and, particularly veg-
ans,  are  more  likely  to  tend  toward  dry
skin.) Individuals with OSNW skin who
suffer  from  rosacea,  particularly  facial
flushing, are advised to abstain from alco-
hol, hot (in temperature) foods, and spicy
food. In addition, such patients should be
counseled  to  keep  a  record  or  diary  of
foods that exacerbate their condition, so
that  they  have  a  clear  idea  of  specific
dietary triggers to avoid.

Pigmented Versus Nonpigmented
Skin Types

One  focus  of  altering  one’s  suscepti-
bility  to  develop  pigmentary  changes
(melasma, solar lentigos) is the study of
endogenous agents that have the poten-
tial  to  impart  whitening  or  lightening
activity. For example, vitamins C and E
have  been  reported  to  suppress  the
spread  of  UV-induced  hyperpigmenta-
tion  in  the  skin  of  hairless  mice.74 (See
Chapter  33  for  more  information  on
these agents.)

In  a  recent  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  trial,  investigators  examined
the various effects of dietary ellagic acid-
rich  pomegranate  extract  on  skin  pig-
mentation  after  UV  irradiation  in  13
women  in  their  20s  to  40s.  Volunteers
were randomly assigned to one of three
groups  (high  dose  [200  mg/d  ellagic
acid],  low  dose  [100  mg/d]  or  placebo 
[0 mg/d]) for the 4-week study. Subjects
completed questionnaires regarding the
condition of their skin prior to and after
completing  the  dietary  intervention.
Based  on  the  minimum  erythema  dose
(MED) value recorded the previous day,
a 1.5 MED dose of UV was administered
to  each  participant  on  the  inner  right
upper arm. Based on baseline recordings
and assessments at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4,
investigators  found  that  in  the  high
ellagic acid dose group and the low-dose
group  in  comparison  to  the  control
group  declining  luminance  rates  were
inhibited by 1.73% and 1.35%, respec-
tively.  Questionnaire  results  indicated
that  the  subjects  observed  improve-
ments  such  as  greater  brightness  and
diminished  pigmentation.  The  investi-
gators concluded that the oral consump-
tion  of  ellagic  acid-rich  pomegranate
extract exerts inhibitory activity against
moderate  pigmentation  engendered  by
UV exposure.75 Previously, several of the
same  investigators  reported  that  an
ellagic  acid-rich  pomegranate  extract
displayed  inhibitory  properties  against
mushroom tyrosinase in vitro, compara-
ble  to  the  known  skin-whitening  agent
arbutin. In addition, they demonstrated
that  oral  administration  of  the  pome-
granate  extract  inhibited  UV-induced
skin  pigmentation  in  brownish  guinea
pigs,  comparable  in  skin-whitening
effect  to  the  use  of  L-ascorbic  acid,
although the number of DOPA-positive
epidermal melanocytes was reduced by
the ellagic-rich pomegranate extract but
not by vitamin C. The investigators con-
cluded  that  oral  pomegranate  extract
may be a suitable skin-whitening agent,
likely by dint of suppressing melanocyte

proliferation and melanin production by
tyrosinase in melanocytes.76

To  determine  the  lightening  activity
of  orally  administered  grape  seed
extract, which is laden with the potent
polyphenolic  antioxidant  proantho-
cyanidin, Yamakoshi et al. fed diets con-
taining 1% grape seed extract or 1% vit-
amin C for 8 weeks to guinea pigs with
UV-induced  pigmentation.  No  changes
were  seen  in  the  vitamin  C  or  control
groups, but a lightening effect was man-
ifested  in  the  pigmented  skin  of  the
guinea  pigs  in  the  grape  seed  extract
group,  with  a  reduction  in  the  number
of  DOPA-positive  melanocytes,  among
other key parameters. In addition, grape
seed  extract  was  reported  to  have  dis-
rupted  mushroom  tyrosinase  activity
and melanogenesis without suppressing
cultured  B16  mouse  melanoma  cell
growth. The researchers concluded that
orally  administered  grape  seed  extract
has the capacity to lighten pigmentation
in  guinea  pig  skin  engendered  by  UV
exposure,  possibly  through  the  inhibi-
tion  of  melanin  production  by  tyrosi-
nase in melanocytes as well as free radi-
cal-fueled  melanocyte  proliferation.74
More  recently,  in  a  1-year  open  design
study,  Yamakoshi  et  al.  evaluated  the
effectiveness  of  proanthocyanidin  for
the  treatment  of  melasma.  Between
August  2001  and  January  2002,  proan-
thocyanidin-rich grape seed extract was
orally  administered  to  12  Japanese
female  melasma  patients  and  to  11  of
these  12  subjects  between  March  and
July  2002. 
the
melasma  of  10  of  the  12  women  were
noted during the first period of the study
and  in  6  of  the  11  patients  during  the
second  period,  with  lightening  values
increasing and the melanin index signifi-
cantly  decreasing.  The  investigators
concluded  that  the  polyphenolic  grape
seed  extract  is  effective  in  diminishing
the  hyperpigmentation  associated  with
melasma, with optimal results seen after
6  months  of  oral  administration  and
additional  supplementation  perhaps
helping  to  prevent  exacerbation  of  the
condition  during  the  summer.77 As  is
often  the  case,  more  research  is  neces-
sary, but these preliminary animal study
results support the notion of pomegran-
ate and grape seed consumption or sup-
plementation  for  combating  the  pig-
mentation tendency.

Improvements 

in 

Pycnogenol  is  a  standardized  pine
bark extract containing strong polyphe-
nolic  constituents  with  established
antioxidant  activity.  Research  has  sug-
gested  that  this  patented  botanical
extract formulation is more potent than

vitamins C and E and has the capacity to
recycle vitamin C, regenerate vitamin E
(as  does  vitamin  C),  and  promote  the
activity  of  endogenous  antioxidant
enzymes.78 The  efficacy  of  Pycnogenol
in  protecting  against  UV  radiation
inspired  a  30-day  clinical  trial  of 
30  women  with  melasma  in  which
patients  took  one  25  mg  tablet  of
Pycnogenol  at  each  meal,  3  times  daily.
Researchers noted that the average surface
area  of  melasma  significantly  decreased,
suggesting that Pycnogenol is an effective
and safe treatment for this condition.78

Wrinkled Skin Types

More  than  a  decade  ago,  investigators
estimated the levels of certain vitamins
(i.e.,  A,  C,  E,  and  beta-carotene)  and
trace  elements  (i.e.,  copper,  selenium,
and  zinc)  in  the  blood  of  67  vegetarian
nonsmokers  and  75  nonvegetarians  (all
between the ages of 34 and 60 years) liv-
ing in the same geographical region. The
average  length  of  vegetarianism  (lacto-
or 
lacto-ovovegetarianism)  was  6.2
years. The investigators found that veg-
etarians  had  higher  plasma  levels  of  all
the  tested  vitamins  and  minerals,  all  of
which  play  important  roles  as  antioxi-
in  activating  antioxidant
dants  or 
enzymes.79 In turn, such compounds are
associated  with  various  salubrious
effects,  including  a  photoprotective
effect  against  aging,  exemplified  most
frequently by wrinkles.

In  a  recent  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  trial  assessing  the  effects  of
soy isoflavone aglycone on the skin, par-
ticularly  the  extent  of  linear  and  fine
wrinkles at the lateral angle of the eyes,
of 26 women in their late 30s and early
40s,  the  volunteers  were  randomly
assigned  to  incorporate  into  their  daily
diets for 12 weeks either the experimen-
tal food containing soy (40 mg daily) or a
placebo.  Investigators  observed  statisti-
cally  significant  improvements  of  malar
skin elasticity at week 8 and fine wrinkles
at week 12 in the soy group, as compared
to the control group, and concluded that
the daily dietary consumption of 40 mg
of  soy  isoflavone  aglycones  contributes
to the amelioration of cutaneous signs of
aging in middle-aged women.80

In  a  fascinating  study  of  a  possible
association  between  dietary  intake  and
skin  wrinkling  in  sun-exposed  areas,
Purba  et  al.  used  questionnaires  and
cutaneous  microtopographic  measure-
ments  to  evaluate  diet  and  skin  wrin-
kling  in  177  Greek-born  individuals
living in Melbourne, Australia, 69 Greek
subjects  residing  in  rural  Greece,  48

Anglo-Celtic  Australian  elderly  individ-
uals living in Melbourne, Australia, and
159  Swedish  elderly  participants  living
in  Sweden.  Investigators  identified  the
Swedish  elderly  as  exhibiting  the  least
wrinkling  in  sun-exposed  areas,  fol-
lowed by the Greek-born in Melbourne,
rural  Greek  elderly,  and  then  Anglo-
Celtic  Australians.  Correlation  and
regression  analyses  revealed  significant
data  that  led  the  investigators  to  con-
clude that diet may very well influence
skin  wrinkling.  Generally,  they  found
that  individuals  that  consumed  more
vegetables  (especially  green  leafy  veg-
etables,  spinach  specifically,  as  well  as
asparagus,  celery,  eggplant,  garlic,  and
onions/leeks),  olive  oil,  monounsatu-
rated fat, and legumes and lower levels
of milk and milk products, butter, mar-
garine,  and  sugar  products  manifested
fewer  wrinkles  in  sun-exposed  skin
(Table  8-5).  Significantly,  the  authors
suggested that diets high in monounsat-
urated acids may raise the monounsatu-
rated  fatty  acid  levels  in  the  epidermis,
which resist oxidative damage, whereas
the  PUFAs  are  more  susceptible  to  oxi-
dation. They speculated that this might
explain  the  correlation  of  monounsatu-
rated olive oil and less wrinkling as well
as  the  higher  level  of  wrinkling  associ-
ated  with  the  consumption  of  polyun-
saturated  margarine.  Specifically,  the
investigators identified positive associa-
tions between photodamage and dietary
intake of full-fat milk (but not skim milk,
cheese,  or  yogurt),  red  meat,  potatoes,
soft  drinks/cordials,  and  cakes/pastries.
Conversely,  less  actinic  damage  was
associated with vegetables and legumes,
as  mentioned  above,  as  well  as  apples/
pears,  cherries,  dried  fuits/prunes,  jam,
eggs,  melon,  multigrain  bread,  nuts,
olives,  tea,  water,  and  yogurt.  Finally,
they  noted  that  less  photodamage  was
correlated  with  a  higher  intake  of  the

LIMITS TO ENDOGENOUS PHOTOPROTECTION
It is worth noting that in a review of the
literature  regarding  the  relationship  of
nutrient  intake  and  the  skin,  particularly
the  photoprotective  effects  of  nutrients,
the  influences  of  nutrients  on  cutaneous
immune  responses,  and  therapeutic
actions  of  nutrients  in  skin  disorders,
investigators found that supplementation
with the nutrients of focus (i.e., vitamins,
carotenoids, and PUFAs) rendered protec-
tion against UV light, but not as much as
topical  sunscreens.68 Oral  supplements
should  be  combined  with  sunscreen  use
(Chapter 29) and sun avoidance.

ORAL SUPPLEMENTS AND THE 
SKIN: FROM A TO Z

The following is a brief guide to some of
the  most  common  nutritional  supple-
ments currently used or under study in
the  beauty  and  skin  care  realm.  The
focus  here  is  on  the  effects  that  such
products  confer  on  the  skin.  Several  of
these  compounds  provide  broad  sys-
temic effects. Of course, it is incumbent
upon  practitioners  to  remind  patients
that they should always discuss the use
of  new  supplements  with  their  physi-
cian, particularly when pregnant, breast-
feeding,  or  undergoing  treatment  for
any medical conditions.

Alpha Lipoic Acid

Small  amounts  of  alpha  lipoic  acid  are
produced naturally by the human body,
but when present in excess (as a result of
a supplement, for example), it may help
prevent various diseases. Among these,
alpha lipoic acid is said to help smooth
skin and combat the cutaneous signs of
aging.  Significantly,  perhaps,  alpha
lipoic  acid  was  once  considered  an
antioxidant,  but  a  recent  report  has
called  such  a  designation  into  ques-
tion.82 While alpha lipoic acid seems to
exert  a  positive  impact  on  energy,  and
on several health conditions, the author
does  not  recommend  it  for  skin-related
concerns.  More  research  is  required  to
better understand the protective role of
alpha lipoic acid and its potential appli-
cations for the skin.

Antioxidants

Several  of  the  supplements  in  this  list
qualify as antioxidants (see Chapter 34).

This  particular  entry,  though,  refers  to
products that contain a blend or combi-
nation  of  antioxidants.  For  example,
Imedeen Time Perfection tablets include
antioxidants  such  as  vitamin  C  and
grape seed extract. Antioxidants are sub-
stances that protect cells from oxidative
damage  caused  by  exogenous  factors
such  as  UV  light,  air  pollution,  ozone,
cigarette smoke, and even oxygen itself.
In  addition,  antioxidants  protect  cells
from endogenously generated oxidative
stress,  a  natural  by-product  of  cellular
energy  production.  Oxidative  stress,
whether its origin is external or internal,
contributes  to  inflammatory  pathways
mediated by the formation of free radi-
cals,  which  are  molecules  with  an
uneven number of electrons and are thus
highly  reactive.  Left  unchecked,  free
radicals can cause damage to cell mem-
branes,  lipids,  proteins,  and  DNA,  thus
contributing to skin aging, among a cas-
cade  of  other  deleterious  effects  on
health. Indeed, the cumulative effects of
free radicals over time form the basis of
“The  Damage  Accumulation  Theory  of
Aging.”83 Antioxidants  scavenge  and
eliminate free radicals and are crucial to
the success of a skin care regimen. The
convenience  of  antioxidant  products
also renders them easy to use on a regu-
lar  basis.  Good  dietary  sources  of
antioxidants 
larger
fruits;  vegetables;  beans;  roots  and
tubers;  cereals;  as  well  as  nuts,  seeds,
and dried fruits.84 (See Table 8-6 for spe-
cific foods high in antioxidants.)

include  berries; 

Recently,  investigators  conducted  a
prospective  study  among  1001  ran-
domly chosen Australian adults to eval-
uate the relationship between consump-
tion of antioxidants and risk of basal cell
carcinomas  (BCCs)  and  squamous  cell
carcinomas  (SCCs).  Histologically  veri-
fied cases of skin cancer were recorded
between  1996  and  2004  after  antioxi-
dant  intake  was  estimated  in  1996.  In
individuals  with  a  baseline  skin  cancer
history,  dietary  consumption  of  the
carotenoids  lutein  and  zeaxanthin  was
correlated  with  a  lower  incidence  of
SCC.  However,  a  positive  association
was seen with various antioxidants and
BCC  development  in  those  with  and
without a history of skin cancer, includ-
ing individuals with a specific history of
BCC.  The  researchers  concluded  that
their  findings  supported  prior  evidence
of  divergent  etiologic  pathways  for
these types of skin cancer.85 It is impor-
tant  to  note  that  such  results  do  not
undermine the efficacy of antioxidants;
rather,  these  findings  reinforce  the
notion  that  evidence  trumps  hype.

Antioxidants  are  not  panaceas  for  all
health  problems.  They  offer  significant
benefits,  but  much  additional  research 
is required to grasp the full range of their
capacities.  While  several  antioxidants
impart  wide-ranging 
ameliorative
effects, it appears likely that greater ben-
efits  are  bestowed  by  the  synergistic
activity of several antioxidants. For exam-
ple,  the  oral  supplement  DermaVite™
consists of a combination of, in descend-
ing  order  of  concentration  of  a  marine
protein complex, alpha lipoic acid, vita-
min C, red clover extract, tomato extract,
pine bark extract, vitamins E and B3, soya
extract, zinc, vitamin B5, and copper, that
has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the
treatment of cutaneous aging symptoms
(e.g.,  fine  and  coarse  wrinkles,  rough-
ness,  and  telangiectasia)  in  a  random-
ized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled
study.86

Arnica

The use of the Arnica montana plant has
been promoted by homeopathic practi-
tioners for hundreds of years. Arnica is
used  as  a  supplement  for  its  anti-
inflammatory  properties,  which  have
its  constituent
been  attributed  to 
sequiterpene lactones.87 Its primary skin
care application is in the treatment and
prevention  of  bruises  (see  Chapter  21).
While taking arnica regularly offers little
benefit to the skin, the author suggests it
to  patients  before  cosmetic  procedures
such  as  soft  tissue  augmentation.  Four
homeopathic  arnica  pills  labeled  with
30x dilution taken 4 to 6 hours before a
cosmetic procedure is recommended. In
a  recent  double-blind  study  of  29
patients  given  perioperative  homeo-
pathic A. montana or placebo after under-
going  rhytidectomy,  smaller  areas  of
ecchymosis  were  measured  on  the  4

postprocedural  observation  days,  with
statistically significant reductions identi-
fied on 2 of the 4 days.88 It is important
to  caution  patients  that  high  doses  of
oral arnica can be harmful, so this dose
and potency should not be exceeded. If a
mild rash develops, the patient is likely
sensitive  to  the  compound  helenalin,  a
key  constituent  found  in  arnica.  In  this
case, arnica use should be halted. While
not  falling  into  the  category  of  nutri-
tional supplements, topical creams with

pace of bruise healing.

Beta-Carotene

Beta-carotene  is  a  member  of  the
carotenoid  family,  highly  pigmented
(red,  orange,  yellow),  lipid-soluble  sub-
stances  naturally  present  in  several
fruits,  grains,  oils,  and  vegetables  (such
as  apricots,  carrots,  green  peppers,
spinach,  squash,  and  sweet  potatoes).
Notably, in a systematic study of antiox-
idants  in  dietary  plants,  carrots  were
found  to  have  the  lowest  content  of
antioxidants  of  the  array  of  roots  and
tubers screened.84 Because it can be con-
verted  into  active  vitamin  A  (retinol),
beta-carotene  is  a  provitamin,  as  are
alpha-  and  gamma-carotene.  Beta-
carotene has received substantially more
attention  than  the  other  carotenoid
compounds because it has been shown
to  contribute  much  more  to  human
nutrition as compared to its related sub-
stances.68

In 2006, Stahl and Krutmann reported
that the systemic use of beta-carotene in
dosages  of  15  to  30  mg/d  for  10  to 
12 weeks had been shown to impart pro-
tection against UV-induced erythema, but
was  insufficient  in  terms  of  offering  full

protection against UVR.89 More recently,
investigators reviewed the literature up to
June 2007 in PubMed, ISI Web of Science,
and  the  epidermolysis  bullosa  acquisita
Cochrane  Library  in  conducting  a  meta-
analysis  of  supplementation  studies  of
dietary  beta-carotene  as  protection
against  sunburn.  Meta-analysis  of  the
seven  studies  identified  revealed  that
beta-carotene 
supplementation  did
indeed confer protection against sunburn
in a time-dependent fashion, with a mini-
mum  of  10  weeks  of  supplementation
necessary.90 Indeed,  in  September  2007,
Stahl  and  Sies  clarified  that  dietary
carotenoids  such  as  beta-carotene  and
lycopene,  as  well  as  flavonoids,  con-
tribute  to  the  prevention  of  UV-induced
erythema  formation  after  ingestion  and
dispersal to light-exposed areas, including
the  skin  and  eyes.  Specifically,  these
micronutrients reduced sensitivity to UV-
induced  erythema  in  volunteers  after  10
to  12  weeks  of  dietary  intervention.91
Clearly, there are limits to the protection
afforded by beta-carotene. In a large-scale
randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  12-year  primary-prevention
trial  of  beta-carotene  supplementation
with  follow-up,  investigators  found  that
supplementing  with  50  mg  of  beta-
carotene  on  alternate  days  in  apparently
healthy  male  physicians  from  40  to  84
years of age in 1982 (n (cid:10) 22,071) did not
influence the development of a first basal
cell  or  squamous  cell  carcinoma.92 It  is
worth  noting  that  beta-carotene  supple-
mentation has been demonstrated to con-
tribute to elevating the risk of developing
lung cancer in smokers and those exposed
to asbestos.93

There  are  minor  risks 

inherent 
in  taking  too  much  beta-carotene 
and  other  provitamin  A  compounds.
Superficially, the tint of one’s skin can be
rendered  more  yellow  by  consuming

excess carotenoids. Because of the inef-
ficiency  in  the  conversion  of  beta-
carotene  into  retinol,  there  is  less  risk
posed by beta-carotene supplementation
in comparison to vitamin A supplemen-
tation. The author prefers to see patients
derive the benefits of beta-carotene pri-
marily  from  diet,  but  it  can  be  a  useful
supplement for those living in warm cli-
mates  where  frequent  sun  exposure  is
more  likely  and  whose  diets  do  not
include enough of this carotenoid.

Biotin

Also  known  as  vitamin  B7,  biotin  has
been  shown  to  increase  nail  thickness
by  up  to  25%  in  patients  with  brittle
nails while minimizing nail breakage or
flaking.94 Nail  strength  can  also  be
augmented  through  supplementation
with biotin.95 The author recommends a 
2.5-mg  daily  dose  of  biotin  to  all
patients  whose  nails  are  especially  sus-
ceptible to breaking or splitting with lit-
tle provocation. Indeed, brittle nail syn-
drome  has  been  demonstrated  to
improve with this dosage.96

Borage Seed Oil

Borage seed oil is an omega-6 fatty acid
rich  in  gamma-linolenic  acid  (GLA),
which cannot be synthesized by human
skin  from  the  precursor  LA.  GLA  is
thought to assist in hydrating the skin. As
an  oral  supplement,  borage  seed  oil  is
thought to be effective for soothing skin
inflammation  and  redness.  It  is  also
touted  as  an  ingredient  for  moisturizing
and  strengthening  the  skin  barrier.  In  a
study of the effects of dietary supplemen-
tation  with  borage  seed  oil,  29  healthy
elderly  people,  with  an  average  age  of
nearly 69, were given daily doses of 360
or  720  mg  for  2  months.  A  statistically
significant  improvement  in  the  barrier
function of the skin was observed, with
reductions  in  transepidermal  water  loss
and  dry  skin  complaints.  Investigators
also  noted  decreases  in  saturated  and
monounsaturated  fats,  and  concluded
that  fatty  acid  metabolism  alterations
and  skin  function  amelioration  resulted
from borage seed oil consumption.97

Bromelain

The stem of the pineapple plant, Ananas
comosus,  is  the  source  of  bromelain,  a
term  used  to  designate  its  constituent
family  of  sulfhydryl-containing  prote-
olytic enzymes.98 It is indicated for cuta-
neous  purposes  because  of  its  anti-
inflammatory  properties,  although  it  is
usually administered orally to aid diges-

tion.  In  one  study,  patients  with  long
bone  fractures  who  received  systemic
bromelain  manifested 
significantly 
less  postoperative  edema  than  the
placebo group.99 In addition to its use as
a digestive aid, bromelain is commonly
employed to treat inflammation and soft
tissue injuries. The proteolytic enzymes
of  bromelain  have  imparted  various
wound-healing  benefits,  such  as  allevi-
ating  bruising,  edema,  and  pain.100 In
fact,  the  presurgical  administration  of
bromelain is associated with accelerated
healing  after  surgical  procedures  and
other trauma,101 especially given its abil-
ity to potentiate antibiotics.102 However,
anecdotal  reports  suggest  that  using
bromelain  prior  to  a  procedure  will
increase  bruising.  For  this  reason,  the
author  recommends  500  mg  of  brome-
lain twice daily for 3 days to all patients
after procedures such as dermal filling, to
minimize  bruising  (see  Chapter  21).  In
addition,  it  is  worth  suggesting  the  use
of bromelain to patients that bruise eas-
ily.  Bromelain  is  contraindicated  in
patients using anticoagulant agents such
as  warfarin.  Other  contraindications
include  children,  individuals  with  aller-
gies to pineapple or bee stings, and peo-
ple with a history of heart palpitations.

Caffeine

The  best-known  ingredient  of  coffee,
caffeine is found naturally in the leaves,
seeds,  or  fruits  in  several  plants,  and  is
present  in  tea,  chocolate,  soda,  and
other  products.  Consumed  in  popular
beverages  such  as  coffee  and  tea,  caf-
feine  or  its  metabolites  are  thought  to
confer  significant  anticarcinogenic  and
antioxidant  properties.103–106 For  exam-
ple, a 23-week period of oral administra-
tion of green tea or black tea to SKH-1
mice  at  high  risk  of  developing  skin
cancer  because  of  twice  weekly  expo-
sure to UVB (30 mJ/cm2) yielded a lower 
incidence  of  tumors/mouse,  decreased
parametrial  fat  pad  size,  and  decreased
thickness  of  the  dermal  fat 
layer 
away  from  and  directly  under  tumors.
Decaffeinated teas exhibited little or no
effect,  but  the  restoration  of  caffeine
inhibitory  effects.107
restored 
Significant anticarcinogenic activity has
also been displayed through the topical
application of caffeine to SKH-1 hairless,
tumor-free  mice  pretreated  with  UVB
twice weekly for 20 weeks.108 In topical
products (e.g., La Roche-Posay Rosaliac
and Replenix Cream CF), caffeine is an
effective  anti-inflammatory  and  con-
stricts  veins  to  reduce  facial  flushing.
The anti-inflammatory and anticarcino-

the 

genic benefits of orally administered caf-
feine  are  compelling.  Caffeine  is  also
dehydrating and should be enjoyed with
moderation,  ideally  along  with  water
but without unhealthy condiments such
as  cream  and  sugar.  The  dehydrating
effects  of  caffeine  make  it  a  popular
additive  in  cellulite  creams,  where  its
effects  can  last  around  24  hours.109
Patients  that  are  predisposed  to  facial
flushing  should  be  advised  to  consider
iced beverages, as hot ones may exacer-
bate facial redness.

Coenzyme Q10

levels  also 

Ubiquinone, more familiarly referred to
as coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), is a potent
antioxidant found in all human cells that
assists  with  energy  production.  Good
dietary  sources  of  CoQ10  include  fish,
shellfish,  spinach,  and  nuts.  CoQ10,
which  is  a  fat-soluble  compound,  is
thought  to  prevent  oxidative  stress-
induced  apoptosis  by  inhibiting  lipid
peroxidation  in  plasma  membranes,
thereby  suppressing  free  radical  devel-
opment.  In  the  mitochondria  of  each 
cell of the body, CoQ10 plays a signifi-
cant role in the energy-producing adeno-
sine  triphosphate  pathways.  Energy 
production  is  an  important  aspect  of 
cellular  metabolism,  the  efficiency  of
which  is  thought  to  decrease  with  age.
CoQ10 
coincidentally 
decline  with  age.110 Supplementation
with ubiquinone is believed to deceler-
ate  the  reduction  in  energy  production
associated  with  senescence  and  illness.
Recently,  Ashida  et  al.  found  that
CoQ10 intake augmented the epidermal
CoQ10  level  in  43-week-old  hairless
male  mice,  which,  coupled  with  their
previous  finding  that  extended  CoQ10
supplementation in humans lowered the
wrinkle  area  rate  and  wrinkle  volume
per  unit  area  around  the  corner  of  the
eye,  led  them  to  conclude  that  CoQ10
supplementation may have the potential
to reduce wrinkles and confer additional
cutaneous  benefits.111 It  is  also  worth
noting  that  topical  CoQ10  has  been
demonstrated  to  penetrate  the  viable
layers of the epidermis and decrease the
level  of  oxidation  measured  by  weak
photon  emission,  and  reduce  wrinkle
depth. In the same study, CoQ10 inhib-
ited  collagenase  expression  in  human
fibroblasts  after  UVA  irradiation.  The
investigators  concluded  that  topical
CoQ10  may  be  effective  in  preventing
the  deleterious  effects  of  UV  radiation
exposure.112 CoQ10 supplements impart
stimulatory  effect.

use  in  the  morning,  typically  200  mg.
Individuals  taking  cholesterol-lowering
statin drugs should be counseled to con-
sider  this  supplement,  as  statins  reduce
natural  CoQ10  levels.  Low  CoQ10
levels  are  associated  with  fatigue  and
muscle  cramping.  Those  on  cholesterol
lowering  drugs  should  consider  taking
400 mg every morning.

Evening Primrose Oil

Derived from the seeds of evening prim-
rose  (Oenothera  biennis),  a  hardy  biennial
member of the Onagraceae family noted
for its fragrant flowers that open at dusk
during  the  summer,  EPO  is  an  omega-6
fatty  acid  that  contains  both  LA  and
GLA). In fact, it is one of the best sources
of  GLA,  a  polyunsaturated  essential 
cis-fatty acid important in the production
of prostaglandins, which play a role in the
functioning of most bodily systems. LA is
used by the body to synthesize GLA. In
addition,  LA  imparts  significant  benefits
to the skin, maintaining stratum corneum
cohesion  and  reducing  transepidermal
water  loss113 (see  Chapter  11).  Overall,
though,  the  health  benefits  of  EPO  are
attributed to GLA. In a double-blind trial
assessing the effects of oral EPO on atopic
eczema,  researchers  found  a  statistically
significant improvement among the EPO
patients in overall severity of symptoms,
including  reductions  in  percentage  of
body surface involvement, inflammation,
xerosis,  and  pruritus.  While  patients
receiving placebo experienced less inflam-
mation,  EPO  patients  demonstrated  a 
significantly  greater  reduction  and  a  sig-
nificant increase in plasma levels of diho-
acid.114 Conse-
mogammalinolenic 
quently,  some  authors  have  speculated
that supplementing with products high in
GLA,  such  as  EPO,  may  be  effective  for
patients  with  atopic  eczema.115 EPO
taken  as  an  oral  supplement  is  judged  a
valuable source of essential fatty acids. It
is approved in Germany for eczema and
PMS and other uses. In 2004, it was found
in a survey of more than 21,000 adults to
be the most commonly used oral supple-
ment.116 In addition, EPO combined with
zinc  has  been  used  to  soothe  dry  eyes,
ameliorate brittle nails, and to treat acne
and  sunburn.  Overall,  this  supplement
may be effective in helping to hydrate the
skin, as well as easing inflammation and
irritation. The author particularly recom-
mends  EPO  to  patients  who  experience
frequent skin irritation.

Glucosamine

Typically  derived  from  the  shells  of
shellfish  (although  synthetic  versions

that 

are  also  available),  glucosamine  and  its
derivative  N-acetyl  glucosamine  are
amino-monosaccharides 
serve
several significant biological roles, partic-
ularly in the production of cartilage. Both
act as substrate precursors for hyaluronic
acid (HA) as well as proteoglycans syn-
thesis. Given its role in HA production, it
is  not  surprising  that  glucosamine  has
been  demonstrated  to  confer  various
cutaneous  benefits,  such  as  enhancing
hydration, reducing wrinkles, and accel-
erating wound healing.117 In addition to
anti-inflammatory and  chondroprotec-
tive  properties,  glucosamine  has  been
shown to be effective in treating hyper-
pigmentation  because  it  inhibits  tyrosi-
nase  activation  thereby  suppressing
melanin  synthesis.117 In  a  randomized,
controlled,  single-blind  5-week  study
with  53  female  volunteers  who  were
given  an  oral  supplement  containing
glucosamine, amino acids, minerals, and
various antioxidant compounds, investi-
gators  found  a  statistically  significant
reduction (34%) in the number of visible
wrinkles  and  a  reduction  (34%)  in  the
number  of  fine  lines  in  the  treatment
group  as  compared  to  the  12-person
control  group.118 Oral  glucosamine
supplementation  has  also  been  demon-
strated  to  ameliorate  symptoms  and
decelerate  the  development  of  osteo-
arthritis in animals as well as in clinical
trials  in  humans,  and  its  list  of  indica-
tions  is  expanding.117 In  a  retrospective
survey  of  the  nonvitamin,  nonmineral
dietary  supplements  used  among  an
elderly  cohort  between  1994  and  1999,
glucosamine  emerged  as  the  most  fre-
quently used supplement.119 The author
recommends  1500  mg/d,  particularly 
to  patients  older 
than  35  years.
Glucosamine  supplements  have  been
demonstrated to assist in rebuilding car-
tilage,  in  which  HA  is  an  important
component.  Evidence  suggests  that  the
effects of glucosamine supplementation,
namely,  increased  skin  fullness  and
decreased wrinkles, can be seen in as lit-
tle as 4 to 6 weeks.

Horse Chestnut Seed Extract

Of  the  various  species  of  horse  chest-
nuts,  trees  as  well  as  bushes,  the
European  horse  chestnut  (Aesculus  hip-
pocastanum)  is  the  one  used  most  often
for medicinal purposes. In its oral form,
horse chestnut seed extract (HCSE) has
been  shown  to  effectively  enhance  cir-
culatory problems such as varicose veins
and  leg  cramping.  Indeed,  researchers
conducting a thorough literature review
of  double-blind,  randomized  controlled

trials  of  oral  HCSE  for  patients  with
chronic venous insufficiency in Medline,
EMBASE,  BIOSIS,  CISCOM,  and  the
Cochrane Library (until December 1996)
found  that  HCSE  was  superior  to
placebo in all cases.120 In addition, they
noted  reductions  in  lower-leg  volume,
leg circumference at the calf and ankle,
and  improvement  in  symptoms  includ-
ing  leg  pain,  pruritus,  fatigue,  and  ten-
sion,  with  only  rare  mild  adverse  reac-
tions.  The  same  investigators,  along
with a third, subsequently conducted a
broad  database  search  of  Medline,
EMBASE,  the  Cochrane  Library,  CIS-
COM, and AMED (until October 2000)
on complementary and alternative med-
icine  and  found  additional  cogent  evi-
dence for the effectiveness of oral HCSE
for  the  treatment  of  chronic  venous
insufficiency.121 HCSE  has  been  proven
to  improve  inflammation  and  circula-
tory discomfort in its oral form. Patients
taking  anticoagulant  drugs  should  be
advised not to supplement with HCSE.

Hyaluronic Acid

One of the three primary constituents of
the dermis, HA, also known as hyaluro-
nan, is the most abundant glycosamino-
glycan in the human dermis. HA, which
has  the  capacity  to  bind  water  up  to
1000 times its volume, plays an impor-
tant  role  in  cell  growth,  membrane
receptor function and adhesion. Its main
biologic  function  in  the  intercellular
matrix  is  to  stabilize  intercellular  struc-
tures  and  form  the  elastoviscous  fluid
matrix  in  which  collagen  and  elastin
fibers  are  firmly  enveloped.122,123 HA
holds onto moisture, as well, and helps
provide  fullness  and  radiance  to  the
skin. While HA is the main component
of  several  effective  and  popular  dermal
filling agents, and has also demonstrated
efficacy  as  an  intra-articular  injection
agent for knee osteoarthritis,124 oral HA
supplements  are  also  available.  These
products  are  touted  for  combating  the
decline  of  HA,  which  occurs  with  age.
However,  HA  is  metabolized  in  the
stomach; therefore, the author does not
believe  there  is  any  evidence  demon-
strating  the  effectiveness  of  these  sup-
plements.

Iron

Found in every cell of the body, iron is
an  important  mineral  for  all-around
good  health  and  is  essential  in  the
production  of  hemoglobin,  the  blood
component  that  distributes  oxygen
throughout  the  body.  Low  iron  levels
have  been  associated  with  hair  loss.

Supplementation  could  help  control  or
resolve  this  condition.  Iron  deficiency
may also manifest in the fingernails, as
white spots or vertical ridges. Physicians
should  check  a  patient’s  ferritin  levels
prior  to  recommending  an  iron  supple-
ment. Excess iron can generate free radi-
cals,  which  attack  vital  skin  con-
stituents,  such  as  collagen  and  elastin,
and  accelerate  cutaneous  aging.  Iron
supplements should be recommended to
patients only if it is determined that they
have  low  iron  levels.  Good  dietary
sources  of  iron  include  dried  beans,
dried  fruits,  egg  yolks,  salmon,  tuna,
whole grains, and other foods.

Lycopene

Naturally  present  in  human  blood  and
tissues, lycopene is a non-provitamin A
carotenoid  best  known  as  the  pigment
mainly responsible for the characteristic
red  color  of  tomatoes.  During  the  last
decade,  lycopene  has  garnered  much
attention  for  its  potent  antioxidant
activity.125,126 Lycopene may play a role
in reducing oxidative damage to tissues,
as  suggested  by  a  placebo-controlled
study  that  examined  the  effects  on
plasma and skin concentrations of beta-
carotene and lycopene from ingesting a
single  120-mg  dose  of  beta-carotene.
The  effects  from  UV  light  exposure
were also examined. Lycopene levels in
plasma and skin, which are comparable
or  greater  than  those  of  beta-carotene,
were unaffected by beta-carotene inges-
tion, but beta-carotene levels increased.
Furthermore,  a  single  intense  exposure
(3  times  the  MED)  of  solar-simulated
light  on  a  small  area  of  the  volar  arm
resulted  in  a  31%  to  46%  decrease  in
skin lycopene concentration, but no sig-
nificant  changes  in  skin  beta-carotene,
which led the investigators to conclude
that lycopene may contribute to absorb-
ing or mitigating the effects of UV radia-
tion  and  other  forms  of  oxidative
insult.127 Recently,  protection  against
erythema  development  after  UV  expo-
sure  has  been  demonstrated  as  a  result
of  increasing  lycopene  intake  by  daily
consumption  of  tomato  paste  for  a 
10-week  period.125 Consequently,  Sies
and  Stahl,  who  conducted  the  study,
have deemed lycopene an effective oral
sun  protectant  that  can  play  an  impor-
tant role in maintaining the health of the
skin.  In  work  published  by  these  and
additional  investigators  in  the  same
year,  supplementation  for  12  weeks
with  24  mg/d  of  a  carotenoid  formula-
tion including beta-carotene, lutein, and
lycopene  was  found  in  a  placebo-

controlled, parallel study design to exert
a  comparable  improvement  in  mitigat-
ing UV-induced erythema in humans as
24  mg  of  beta-carotene  alone.42 More
recent work by some of the same inves-
tigators  has  further  buttressed  the  evi-
dence  showing  the  photoprotective
effects  of  lycopene  supplementation,
with  significant  increases  measured  in
lycopene  serum  levels  and  total  skin
carotenoids; erythema was also demon-
strably prevented after UV irradiation.43
More 
is  necessary,  but
lycopene, through oral supplementation
or topical administration, is also consid-
ered a potential chemopreventive agent
of nonmelanoma skin cancer.126

Niacin

Also  known  as  vitamin  B3 or  nicotinic
acid,  niacin  has  long  been  known 
to be essential for the healthy function-
ing  of  the  skin  and  nervous  system.
Niacinamide  (also  called  nicotinamide)
is  the  amide  form  of  niacin.  The  terms
nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are used
less  frequently  because  they  sound 
similar,  though  unrelated,  to  nicotine.
Neither niacin nor niacinamide are syn-
thesized in the human body; therefore,
they must be supplied through the diet,
topical application or oral supplementa-
tion.  Peanuts,  brewer’s  yeast,  fish,  and
meat  are  the  best  dietary  sources  of
niacin.  The  deficiency  of  niacin  and
niacinamide appears to play a role in the
development of several types of cancer,
including  skin  cancer,  and  niacin  defi-
ciency is also associated with pellagra, a
disease  characterized  by  diarrhea,  der-
matitis,  and  dementia.  Mice  given  oral
niacin or topical niacinamide exhibited a
70%  decrease  in  UV-induced  skin  can-
cers  and  near-complete  prevention  of
photoimmunosuppression.128

For  several  years,  niacinamide  has
been  used  both  topically  and  orally  to
treat  inflammatory  diseases.  For  exam-
ple, Berk et al. described the use of oral
niacinamide  plus  tetracycline  for  the
treatment  of  bullous  pemphigoid.129
Rosacea  is  also  among  the  indica-tions
for niacinamide treatment.130 The use of
oral  or  intravenous  niacin  has  been
described 
treatment  of
the 
migraines  and  tension-type  headaches,
though randomized controlled trials are
lacking.131 Indeed, niacin is well known
for  exhibiting  vasodilatory  activity.131
Patients who take oral niacin for a long-
term  to  control  hypertension  tend  to
develop  bothersome  flushing.  Because
of  this,  topical  products  may  be  more
desirable,  though  the  recently  intro-

for 

duced  extended-release  1000  mg  niacin
ER tablet has been shown to reduce the
frequency,  duration,  and  intensity  of
niacin-induced  flushing.132 Although
niacin  supplements  may  be  prescribed
for various conditions, there is no skin-
related  reason  to  take  more  than  what
would be derived from a typical multivi-
tamin. Niacinamide, in contrast, imparts
no  cutaneous  side  effects  and  is  a  very
effective  ingredient  in  topical  formula-
tions for treating photodamage, inflam-
mation,  hyperpigmentation,  and  dry
skin.  Niacinamide  is  found  in  the  Olay
brand  products  such  as  Total  Effects,
Regenerist,  and  Definity.  The  brand
Nia24 contains an ingredient very simi-
lar to niacinamide.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Although they are not synthesized natu-
rally in the body, omega-3 fatty acids are
a  family  of  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids
(also referred to as n-3 PUFAs or PUFAs)
that are crucial components of cell mem-
branes  and  key  constituents  in  the  skin
barrier. ALA, EPA, and DHA are the pri-
mary essential omega-3 fatty acids. The
anti-inflammatory  activities  of  these
compounds  are  well  established,  as
several  studies  have  demonstrated  their
efficacy in combating erythema and irri-
tation associated with cutaneous condi-
tions  such  as  psoriasis  and  rosacea.
Significant  anti-inflammatory  activity
displayed  by  EPA  and  DHA,  from  oily
extracts  of  three  Mediterranean  fish
species,  against  UVB-induced  erythema
has  been  demonstrated  recently  in  vivo
in  human  volunteers.133 The  hydrating
qualities  of  omega-3  fatty  acids  also
serve  to  add  volume  to  the  skin,  mini-
mizing  the  appearance  of  fine  lines.
Good  dietary  sources  of  the  omega-3
fatty  acid  ALA  include  canola  oil,  wal-
nuts, and “omega-3 eggs” (which provide
much  more  than  the  typical  level  of
omega-3 as a result of the special diet fed
to the hens); for the omega-3 fatty acids
EPA and DHA, fish and other seafood, as
well as “omega-3 eggs” are good dietary
sources.134 The  fish  that  contain  signifi-
cant  levels  of  omega-3  fatty  acids  are
fatty  predatory  fish,  including  albacore
tuna,  lake  trout,  mackerel,  menhaden,
and salmon68 (Table 8-7). It is important
to note that such fish do not synthesize
these  acids  but  accumulate 
them
through  their  diet,  which  may  also
include toxic substances. For this reason,
particularly in the case of mercury toxic-
ity  in  albacore  tuna,  the  FDA  recom-
mends limiting consumption of selected
predatory  fish  species.  Supplementing

with fish oil has become an increasingly
popular alterative. Cod liver oil and other
fish  oils  are  also  good  sources  of  n-3
PUFAs.68 While  noting  the  natural
dietary sources of such nutrients, partic-
ularly  fish,  it  is  important  to  make
dietary choices with environmental sen-
sitivity.  In  particular,  fish  should  be
selected  with  this  in  mind,  as  several
species may be endangered (e.g., cod) or
approaching such status.

Sies  and  Stahl  contend  that  omega-3
fatty  acids  are  among  the  various
micronutrients  that  exhibit  the  capacity
to  deliver  systemic  photoprotection
against  UV-induced  damage.135 In  addi-
tion, Black and Rhodes suggest that there
is a wide array of experimental and clini-
cal  studies  indicating  an  important  role
for  omega-3  fatty  acids  in  preventing
nonmelanoma skin cancer, as manifested
in  evidence  of  increasing  tumor  latency
periods,  decreasing  tumor  number,
increasing  the  UV  radiation-mediated
erythema threshold in humans, and sig-
nificantly reducing proinflammatory and
immunosuppressive  prostaglandin  E
synthase type 2 [PGE(2)] levels in human
skin exposed to UVB.136

In a recent report in the Journal of the
American  Medical  Association,  MacLean 
et al. conducted a literature review, and
consulted  experts  in  the  neutraceutical
field  regarding  unpublished  studies,  to
sift through mixed results on the capac-
ity  of  omega-3  fatty  acids  to  lower  the
risk  of  developing  cancer.  Thirty-eight
articles  were  ultimately  considered  in
their evaluation, yielding the conclusion
that  dietary  supplementation  with
omega-3 fatty acids does not likely pre-
vent  cancer.137 However,  Chen  et  al.
countered  that  none  of  the  38  studies
reviewed  took  into  account  the  mea-
surement  of  fatty  acid  composition  in
patients.  In  addition,  they  suggested
that  in  reviewing  dietary  data,  it  is

important to note that some fish (partic-
ularly  farm-raised  fish)  are  inadequate
sources  of  omega-3  fatty  acids.  Chen 
et  al.  suggested  that  it  remains  uncer-
tain,  but  is  not  unlikely,  as  to  whether
omega-3 fatty acids confer a preventive
effect  against  cancer.138 While  more
research is clearly needed regarding the
diverse effects of dietary omega-3 fatty
acids,  several  benefits  have  been
patently established. The author recom-
mends  incorporating  as  many  sources 
of  omega-3  fatty  acids  into  one’s  diet 
as  desired  and  supplementing  with 
1000 mg/d.

Polypodium Leucotomos

Derived from the fern family, the extract
of Polypodium leucotomos has been used to
treat 
inflammatory  conditions  and
shown,  in  vitro  and  in  vivo,  to  display
inmunomodulating  activity.139 It  is  also
thought  to  exhibit  potent  antioxidant
activity  and  is  considered  a  viable  oral
photoprotectant.140,141

In  2004,  Middelkamp-Hup  et  al.
assessed whether oral Polypodium leucoto-
mos extract  (PLE)  could  diminish  the
clinical  and  histologic  phototoxic  dam-
age  to  human  skin  caused  by  psoralen
with  ultraviolet  A  (PUVA)  treatment.
Ten  healthy  patients  with  skin  types  II
to III were exposed to PUVA alone and
PUVA accompanied by 7.5 mg/kg of oral
PLE. After 48 to 72 hours, clinical results
revealed consistently lower phototoxic-
ity  in  PLE-treated  skin,  with  pigmenta-
tion  reduced  4  months  after  treatment.
Histologic examination indicated signif-
icantly  fewer  sunburn  cells,  and  reduc-
tions in vasodilatation and the tryptase-
positive mast cell infiltration, in addition
to  preservation  of  Langerhans  cells  in
PLE-treated skin. The authors found that
PLE  effectively  protected  the  skin
against the known deleterious effects of
PUVA.142 Although  this  was  a  small
study,  the  results  spurred  the  team  to
additional  study  of  PLE.  In  research
reported  later  in  2004  by  the  same
group,  nine  healthy  individuals,  with
skin types II to III were exposed to vari-
ous  doses  of  artificial  UVR  radiation
without or following oral administration
of 7.5 mg/kg PLE. Investigators assessed
erythematous 
reactions  24  hours 
after  exposure  and  obtained  paired
biopsy specimens from PLE-treated skin
and  untreated  skin.  Significantly  less
erythema  was  noted 
in  the  PLE-
treated  skin.  In  the  biopsy  specimens,
researchers  recorded  fewer  sunburn
cells,  cyclobutane  pyrimidine  dimers,
and proliferating epidermal cells as well

as less mast cell infiltration. Preservation
of  Langerhans  cells  was  also  achieved.
The team’s previous findings were sup-
ported  by  this  study,  which  prompted
them  to  conclude  that  oral  PLE  effec-
tively  protects  the  skin  against  UV
insult.143

In a study by Middelkamp-Hup et al.
of the potential of oral PLE in the treat-
ment  of  vitiligo  vulgaris,  50  patients
were randomly administered 250 mg of
oral PLE or placebo 3 times daily, com-
bined  with  the  first-line  therapy  (nar-
row-band UVB) twice weekly for 25 or
26 weeks. Investigators identified a defi-
nite trend in repigmentation in the head
and  neck  area,  particularly  in  light  skin
types, with the combined narrow-band
UVB  and  oral  PLE  therapy.144 PLE  is
most widely available in a capsule sup-
plement  known  as  Heliocare.  It  is
expensive,  but  it  helps  protect  the  skin
against  UV  damage,  and  reduces  ery-
thema  caused  by  sun  exposure.  The
author  recommends  one  capsule  taken
in  the  morning  when  sun  exposure  is
anticipated, two capsules if the exposure
is expected to be prolonged.

Selenium

An important antioxidant, selenium is a
trace  mineral  found  naturally  in  the
body  and  various  foods,  particularly
Brazil nuts. Some seafood, meat, cereals,
and dairy products contain selenium as
do several plant foods, depending on the
selenium  content  of  the  soil  in  which
they are grown. Selenium is essential to
good health, but required in only small
amounts.145 A  properly  functioning
thyroid  is  also  dependent  on  selenium.
In addition, the protective activity char-
acteristic  of  the  immune  cells  is  sup-
ported by the synergistic cooperation of
various vitamins and minerals, including 
selenium.146 Although  a  capacity  to
protect  against  skin  cancer  has  been
recently  disproved,  selenium  remains
among the list of potential oral or topical
chemopreventive  agents  against  other
forms  of  cancer,126 and  it  is  considered
an important contributor to antioxidant
defense.135,147 However, in a recent pro-
spective  case-cohort  study  of  the  link
between  arsenic-related  premalignant
skin  lesions  and  prediagnostic  blood
selenium levels in 303 cases newly diag-
nosed  from  November  2002  to  April
2004  and  849  subcohort  members
randomly  selected  from  the  8092  sub-
jects  in  the  Health  Effects  of  Arsenic
Longitudinal  Study,  investigators  found
intake  may 
that  dietary  selenium 
lower  the  incidence  of  arsenic-related

premalignant  skin  lesions  among  sus-
ceptible  populations  (those  exposed  to
arsenic from drinking water).148 In addi-
tion, it is thought to exhibit potent anti-
inflammatory  and  antiaging  properties
and,  in  oral  form,  appears  to  mitigate
UV-induced  skin  damage.  Although
more research is necessary, selenium in
both  oral  and  topical  form  appears  to
impart several benefits to the skin. It is
used as a topical water to treat psoriasis,
eczema,  and  other  inflammatory  skin
conditions in the La Roche-Posay spa in
France  dedicated  to  the  treatment  of
these  skin  conditions.  Most  multivita-
mins  typically  contain  a  sufficient
amount of selenium. The recommended
daily allowance of selenium for adults is
55  (cid:12)g,  and  overdose  can  be  harmful
(generally, more than 400 μg/d). In fact,
excessive amounts of selenium can lead
to hair loss.

Vitamin A

Retinol,  also  known  as  vitamin  A,  has
such status because it is not synthesized
in the human body. The term “retinoids”
refers to vitamin A and all its natural and
synthetic  derivatives  including  retinol.
Carotenoids  such  as  carrots,  can-
taloupes,  sweet  potatoes,  and  spinach
are  among  the  best  dietary  sources  of
vitamin A.149 Milk, margarine, eggs, beef
liver,  and  fortified  breakfast  cereals  are
also  important  dietary  contributors  of
vitamin A.150 The retinoids exhibit sev-
eral  important  biologic  effects,  such  as
regulating growth and differentiation of
epithelial cells, inhibiting tumor promo-
tion during experimental carcinogenesis,
diminishing  malignant  cell  growth,
decreasing inflammation, and enhancing
the immune system151 (see Chapter 30).
Retinoids  have  also  been  shown  to
improve  the  appearance  of  striae  and
improve skin discoloration.152 Vitamin A
is also particularly beneficial for individ-
uals  with  acne,  as  it  helps  diminish  oil
levels  in  the  skin.  In  addition,  retinoic
acid,  or  tretinoin,  is  known  to  reverse
the signs of photoaging by diminishing
wrinkles,  actinic  keratoses,  and  lentig-
ines as well as smoothing skin texture.153
In  cooperation  with  several  other  vita-
mins and minerals, including vitamins C
and  E,  as  well  as  zinc,  vitamin  A  con-
tributes  to  enhancing  skin  barrier  func-
tion  as  well  as  immune  cell  protective
activity.146

Vitamin A is an important part of any
diet, but consuming or taking excessive
amounts poses risks, including a greater
susceptibility to bone fracture. There is
rarely a reason to take more than what is

found  in  a  good  multivitamin.  It  is
healthier, however, to derive one’s nec-
essary  vitamin  A  through  diet,  particu-
larly by eating leafy greens, carrots, can-
taloupes,  sweet  potatoes,  spinach,
broccoli, squash, and mangoes.

Vitamin C

Known historically for its role in the pre-
vention  of  scurvy,  vitamin  C  is  abun-
dantly  available  in  citrus  fruits.  In  fact,
by  the  18th  century,  sailors  knew  that
eating citrus fruits prevented this condi-
tion  associated  with  dental  abnormali-
ties,  bleeding  disorders,  characteristic
purpuric skin lesions, and mental deteri-
oration.  In  the  1930s,  researchers  con-
firmed that vitamin C is the key ingredi-
ent  in  citrus  fruit  that  fends  off  scurvy,
and  dubbed  it  ascorbic  acid  (scobutus is
Latin for scurvy). Currently, vitamin C is
considered  a  potent  antioxidant  and  is
used effectively as an antiaging and anti-
inflammatory agent.

In  the  skin,  vitamin  C  plays  an  inte-
gral role in the metabolism of collagen,
where  it  is  essential  for  the  hydroxyla-
tion of lysine and proline in procollagen
(see Chapter 2). Vitamin C has also been
demonstrated to augment collagen syn-
thesis in both neonatal and adult fibro-
blasts when added to culture medium.154
Aging skin is characterized by decreased
collagen  production  (see  Chapter  6).
Consequently, it is thought that increas-
ing collagen production in the skin with
vitamin  C  should  theoretically  con-
tribute  to  preventing  or  even  reversing
some of the signs of cutaneous aging.155
The stimulatory effects of vitamin C on
collagen  synthesis  are  believed  to  be
effective  in  preventing  and  treating
striae  alba  (stretch  marks).  This  impor-
tant  role  in  collagen  synthesis  indicates
the  relevance  of  vitamin  C  in  wrinkle
prevention.

In a literature review of the photopro-
tective effects of vitamins C and E, inves-
tigators found that topical applications of
each  individual  antioxidant  performed
significantly  better  than  their  orally
administered  counterparts.  The  photo-
protective  effects  of  vitamin  C  and  E
combinations, along with other antioxi-
dants,  proved  to  be  markedly  more
effective than monotherapies in deliver-
ing cutaneous protection against UVB.156
In  a  3-month  study  of  the  effects  of
oral administration of a combination of
vitamins  C  and  E,  investigators  found
significant  decreases  in  the  sunburn
response  to  UVB  exposure,  with  sub-
thymine  dimers
stantially 
induced  by  UV  radiation,  implying  a

fewer 

protective  effect  against  DNA  damage
conferred  by  the  antioxidant  combina-
tion.157 In  a  more  recent  study  of  the
effects  of  the  oral  administration  of  a
mixture  combining  the  antioxidants
vitamins C and E, Pycnogenol, and EPO
on  UVB-induced  wrinkle  formation,
female SKH-1 hairless mice received the
test  mixture  or  control  vehicle  for 
10  weeks  along  with  UVB  irradiation 
3  times  weekly,  with  graduated  in-
creases  in  UVB  intensity.  Investigators
found that UVB-induced wrinkle forma-
tion  was  significantly  inhibited,  with
substantial  reductions  also  seen  in
epidermal  thickness  as  well  as  UVB-
engendered  acanthosis,  hyperplasia,
and hyperkeratosis.158

Many physicians, including the author,
recommend  that  patients  take  oral  vita-
min C 500 mg twice daily. This way they
enjoy  the  benefits  of  vitamin  C  without
the  irritation  and  expense  of  topical  for-
mulations, which are difficult to stabilize.
Other than an upset stomach, there is no
risk of taking too much vitamin C.

Vitamin D

Perhaps best known as the vitamin skin
produces  when  exposed  to  ultraviolet
light, vitamin D3, often shortened to vit-
amin  D,  is  actually  a  hormone,  and  a
potent  antioxidant.  Besides  sun  expo-
sure, vitamin D can be obtained through
the  diet,  especially  by  consumption  of
fatty  fish.159 Through  the  metabolic
process,  vitamin  D  is  converted  into 
25-hydroxyvitamin  D  (25(OH)D)  by 
the  liver  and  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D(1,25(OH)2D) by the kidneys.159 It has
been known for several years that UVB
exposure induces epidermal keratinocytes
to convert 7-dehydrocholesterol into vit-
amin D3. In addition, the metabolites of
vitamin  D3,  particularly  calcitriol,  are
known  to  confer  significant  benefits,
such  as  antiproliferative  and  prodiffer-
entiating  activity  as  well  as  regulating
cellular  activity  in  keratinocytes  and
immunocompetent cells.160

In  addition  to  imparting  benefits  to
most  bodily  organ  systems,  vitamin  D
plays a significant role in psoriasis treat-
ments,  including  the  drug  Dovonex.
Like all antioxidants, vitamin D exhibits
the  capacity  to  decelerate  aspects  of
cutaneous  aging.  Cutaneous  vitamin 
D3  synthesis  declines  with  age.  Cons-
equently,  vitamin  D  deficiency  is  not
uncommon  in  the  elderly,  the  demo-
graphic  group  most  in  need  of  taking
oral  vitamin  D  supplements.  Low
vitamin D status is a factor in the devel-
opment  of  osteoporosis.  Vitamin  D

insufficiency is also associated with rick-
ets, certain types of cancer, and various
other diseases.161

Vitamin  D  deficiency  can  lead  to  an
elevation  in  serum  parathyroid  hor-
mone,  contributing  to  bone  resorption,
osteoporosis, and fractures. Supplemen-
tation  with  vitamin  D  has  been  shown
to  inhibit  serum  parathyroid  hormone,
increase bone mineral density, and may
reduce the incidence of fractures, partic-
ularly in the elderly.159 In a 12-week ran-
domized clinical study in a psychogeri-
atric  nursing  home  comparing  the
effects of UV radiation and oral vitamin
D3 on the vitamin D status and parathy-
roid  hormone  concentration  in  elderly
nursing  home  patients,  investigators
found UVB to be as effective as oral vit-
amin D3 in raising serum 25(OH)D and
serum calcium as well as inhibiting sec-
ondary hyperparathyroidism.162

Research has also shown that vitamin
D analogs may have a role to play in the
medical  therapy  of  melanoma,  even
though  avoiding  exposure 
to  UV
remains  the  best  protection  against
melanoma and nonmelanoma skin can-
cers.163 In addition, research has shown
that  obesity-related  vitamin  D  insuffi-
ciency likely results from the diminished
bioavailability of vitamin D3 from cuta-
neous and dietary sources due to deposi-
tion in body fat.164

More  than  a  decade  ago,  vitamin  D
became the subject of controversy when
claims  emerged  that  the  use  of  sun-
screen  led  to  vitamin  D  deficiency.165
Despite  mounting  evidence  to  the  con-
trary, this remains a controversial topic.
Interestingly,  Gilchrest  cites  evolution-
ary changes in countering the argument
for controlled exposure to UV to obtain
sufficient  vitamin  D  levels.  Specifically,
she  suggests  that  when  the  human
capacity  to  photosynthesize  vitamin  D
emerged, the lifespan for human beings
was  considerably  shorter  than  it  is
today, and the effects of long-term pho-
todamage, or the modern option of pur-
chasing oral vitamin D, could not be part
of the equation.166

Currently,  the  tolerable  upper  intake
level  (UL)  for  vitamin  D3  stands  at 
50 (cid:12)g/d (2000 IU/d) in North Americans
and Europeans, but several studies sug-
gest  that  metabolic  utilization  of  vita-
min  D3 would  be  optimized  at  a  UL  as
high  as  twice  this  level,  particularly  to
ameliorate  vitamin  D  status  in  the
elderly.161,167,168 The challenge with vita-
min  D  is  balancing  the  mounting
evidence  that  cutaneous  vitamin  D
production  helps  prevent  various  dis-
eases, including some cancers, with the

understanding that prolonged sun expo-
sure  greatly  increases  the  risk  of  skin
cancer and other photodamage. Oral vit-
amin D supplementation in place of UV
exposure  appears  to  be  the  safest
approach, and may be particularly app-
ropriate  for  certain  populations.  For
instance, individuals at high risk for skin
cancer (e.g., those who have red hair and
freckles, or a family history of skin can-
cer)  should  be  advised  to  avoid  unpro-
tected sun exposure and to obtain vita-
min D in oral supplement form and diet.
Mushrooms  have  been  found  to  be  a
good  source  of  vitamin  D.  Blood  levels
of  vitamin  D  should  be  checked  in  all
patients.  If  levels  are  low,  vitamin  D
supplementation  and  the  addition  of
mushrooms to the diet should be recom-
mended along with limited sun exposure.
It  takes  only  a  few  minutes  of  solar
exposure each day to stimulate vitamin
D synthesis. Patients should be reminded
of this and advised that there is never a
good reason to bake in the sun all day.

Vitamin E

Vitamin  E  includes  the  tocopherols  and
the tocotrienols. It is the most significant
lipid-soluble  antioxidant  and  it  is  found
naturally in many vegetables, especially
spinach,  avocados,  corn,  vegetable  oils,
sunflower seeds, soy, whole grains, nuts,
and  margarine.  Usually  referred  to  as
alpha-tocopherol,  its  most  biologically
active  form,  vitamin  E  is  also  found  in
some  meat  and  dairy  products.  In
humans,  vitamin  E  naturally  occurs  in
the membranes of cells and organelles. It
protects cell membranes from peroxida-
tion  and  scavenges 
radicals.
Consequently,  vitamin  E  is  thought  to
help  prevent  cardiovascular  disease  and
the “aging” of the arteries. It is also effec-
tive  in  mitigating  skin  dryness,  particu-
larly in those taking oral retinoids.

free 

Vitamin  E  has  also  been  shown  to
exert  anti-inflammatory  effects  on  the
skin through the inhibition of chemical
mediator  synthesis  and  release.  In
addition to stabilizing lysosomes, vita-
min  E  influences  prostaglandin  E2
production  (decreasing  it)  as  well  as
interleukin-2 production (increasing it).
Anti-inflammatory  and  immunostimu-
latory  effects  are  the  result.151 An
important  component  of  sebum,  vita-
min  E  is  found  in  greater  supply  in
individuals  with  oily  skin.  This  may
correlate  with  less  skin  aging  and  less
skin cancer. The lips, which have no oil
glands  and  are  thus  devoid  of  vitamin
E,  are  more  susceptible  to  skin  cancer
than  many  other  areas  of  the  skin

surface. Antitumorigenic, photoprotec-
tive,  and  skin  barrier-stabilizing  activi-
ties  have  been  associated  with  topical
and oral vitamin E.169

In a hairless mouse model of photo-
carcinogenesis induced by UVB expres-
sion,  investigators  showed  that  oral
administration  of  alpha-tocopherol
resulted in significant inhibitory effects
on  tumor  incidence  and  number.170
However,  in  a  study  assessing  the
capacity of orally administered vitamin
E  and  beta-carotene  to  diminish  mark-
ers of oxidative stress and erythema in
response to UV exposure in 16 healthy
participants  who  took  either  of  the
lipid-soluble  antioxidants  for  8  weeks,
results revealed that such supplementa-
tion  had  no  effect  on  skin  sensitivity,
though the vitamin E group experienced
significant  decreases  in  cutaneous  mal-
ondialdehyde.  No  other  measures  of
oxidative stress in basal or UV-exposed
skin were influenced by the supplemen-
tation, suggesting that neither conferred
photoprotection.171

While results remain conflicting over
the  relative  photoprotective  effects  of
oral  vitamin  E,  the  evidence  strongly
indicates  significant  photoprotective
effects  from  the  orally  administered
combination  of  vitamins  C  and  E.  In  a
single-blind  controlled  clinical  trial
examining  the  photoprotective  effects
of vitamins C and E, 45 healthy volun-
teers  were  divided  into  three  groups,
one receiving oral vitamin C, one receiv-
ing oral vitamin E, and one receiving an
oral  mixture  of  the  two  antioxidants.
Daily  treatments  lasted  1  week.  The
MED  was  ascertained  before  and  after
treatment,  with  the  median  MED
increasing the most in the combination
group,  suggesting  that  d-alpha-toco-
pherol  combined  with  ascorbic  acid
yielded  better  photoprotective  effects
than either of the antioxidants alone.172
For  more  information  on  just  a  few  of
the several reports on the success of this
combination,  see  section  “Vitamin  C”
above. This combination of antioxidants
currently  represents  one  of  the  skin’s
best  defenses  against  photodamage,
including photocarcinogenesis and pho-
toaging.

Vitamin E is an important part of any
diet,  but  there  is  a  risk  from  taking  too
much. The author recommends 400 IU, in
gel  cap  form,  per  day.  Vitamin  E  can
increase the likelihood of bruising if taken
in large doses. Indeed, doses greater than
3000  mg  daily  when  taken  over  a  long
period  may  cause  such  side  effects.
Patients  undergoing  surgical  procedures
should  avoid  doses  of  vitamin  E  greater

than  4000  IU.151 In  addition,  vitamin  E
should  be  discontinued  10  days  prior  to
surgical procedures, soft tissue augmenta-
tion, or Botox injections in order to mini-
mize the risk of bruising.

Vitamin-fortiﬁed Beverages

Various “enhanced water” products have
been  recently  introduced  onto  the  mar-
ket. As an occasional treat, they represent
a  much  better  choice  than  soda,  which
offers  no  health  benefits.  At  least  these
products  provide  a  few  vitamins.  Ersatz
water products are not a substitute for a
good multivitamin, however, and do not
include  common  supplements  such  as
glucosamine or biotin. In addition, these
products  often  contain  high  levels  of
sugar,  which  can  contribute  to  various
health  outcomes  and,  in  the  cutaneous
realm, foster wrinkling caused by glyca-
tion as well as acne eruptions.

The appeal of this market has resulted
in the emergence of sugar-free and nutri-
ent-added  formulations.  For  example,
Coca-Cola  recently  launched  a  product
called  Enviga,  a  sugar-free  beverage  that
contains green tea, one of the most potent
and  best-researched  antioxidants  avail-
able.  In  addition,  the  Borba  product  line
features  nutrient-fortified  waters  specifi-
cally formulated for the skin. (These have
no  added  sugar  and  zero  calories.)  Not
surprisingly,  only  proprietary  in-house
studies  are  available  on  such  products.
While it remains to be seen whether these
products confer any health benefits, there
is no reason to think that they would be
harmful  or  unhealthy.  Another  way  to
derive  cutaneous  benefits  from  liquid
nutrients, other than red wine and green
and other teas, is a “water booster.” These
formulations,  packaged  in  dropper-style
bottles,  can  be  added  to  any  beverage.
The author recommends Dr. Brandt Anti-
Oxidant  Water  Booster/Pure  Green  Tea.
Liquid  supplements  to  be  placed  on  the
tongue  such  as  Dr.  Andrew  Weil  for
Origins™  Plantidote™  Mega-Mushroom
Supplement  are  also  popular,  but
unproven.  These  products  should  be
combined, more importantly, with a well-
rounded diet, exercise, and a good multi-
vitamin.  Finally,  pomegranate  juice  does
note require any vitamin fortification. As
long  as  no  sugar  is  added,  pomegranate
juice packs a potent antioxidant punch.

Zinc

Zinc is an essential trace element found
in,  but  not  produced  by,  the  human
body. It is present in various foods, par-
ticularly high-protein meats such as lean

60

beef, chicken, and fish. A vegetarian diet
often  contains  less  zinc  than  a  meat-
based  diet.  Good  vegetarian  sources  of
zinc  include  beans,  dairy  products,
lentils, nuts, seeds, particularly pumpkin
seeds, whole grain cereals, and yeast.173
Only known as an essential dietary fac-
tor for 40 years, zinc is now also thought
to  exhibit  antioxidant  and  anti-inflam-
matory  activity.174 In  addition,  zinc
assists other micronutrients in bolstering
the function of the skin barrier as well as
the  protective  actions  of 
immune
cells.146 Zinc  is  also  necessary  for  syn-
thesizing retinol binding protein, which
transmits vitamin A. Although there are
no  areas  in  the  body  where  zinc  is
stored, the essential mineral is found in
muscle  (60%),  bone  (30%),  skin  (5%),
and other organs.173,175

The beneficial effects on immunity are
typically cited as the reason for the inclu-
sion  of  zinc  in  various  cold  and  flu  over-
the-counter  remedies.  Indeed,  antiviral
effects  are  now  being  considered.  In  a
placebo-controlled  trial  reported  on  in
2002, investigators found oral zinc sulfate
at a dose of 10 mg/kg daily to be successful
for the treatment of recalcitrant viral warts
after a follow-up of 2 to 3 months.176 The
overlapping,  protective  roles  of  the  skin
and  the  immunity  system  appear  to  be
reflected in the activity of zinc. In a recent
study of the effects on the allergic response
of  zinc  deficiency  in  a  DS-Nh  mouse
model  of  atopic  dermatitis,  investigators
fed  male  mice  a  zinc-deficient  diet  for  4
weeks  and  found  that  zinc  deficiency
affects  the  skin  barrier  and  immune  sys-
tems, and aggravated atopic dermatitis.177
With  age,  zinc  absorption  declines
and zinc deficiency is not uncommon in
the  elderly,  particularly  individuals
older than 75 years.175 Zinc supplemen-
tation  has  been  shown  to  reverse  the
plasma  zinc  reductions,  plasma  oxida-
tive  stress  marker  increases,  and  ele-
vated  production  of 
inflammatory
cytokines  seen  in  the  elderly.174 The
adult  recommended  daily  amount
(RDA), now referred to as the reference
nutrient 
is 
15  mg/d  for  men  and  12  mg/d  for
women, 
though  pregnant  women
require more zinc. It is important to note
that only 20% of the zinc present in the
diet is actually absorbed by the body. In
addition,  zinc  absorption 
is  often
impaired  in  patients  with  chronic  GI
inflammation.  For  oral  mineral  supple-
ments,  the  amounts  of  zinc  and  iron
should be equivalent so that they do not
interfere  with  absorption.  Zinc  is  lost
primarily through feces, urine, hair, skin,
sweat, semen, and menstrual blood.

DIET AND THE SKIN

Diet  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  appear-
ance  of  the  skin  and  plays  a  role  in
everything  from  skin  hydration,  red-
ness, and acne to cutaneous aging. Even
broken blood vessels on the face can be
caused  by  diet.  Based  on  the  studies
reviewed  above,  certain  dietary  princi-
ples can be gleaned and formulated into
suggestions  for  patients  regarding  gen-
eral cutaneous health as well as specific
concerns such as which foods to eat or
avoid in an antiaging or acne treatment
regimen.  The  following  discussion  pro-
vides some general dietary guidelines for
healthy  skin  (Box  8-1) as  well  as  some
specific  recommendations  that  depend
on  skin  type  (Box  8-2).  The  following
dietary recommendations are long-term
interventions  intended  for  good  overall
health  and  the  prevention  of  future
wrinkles,  not  as  treatment  for  already
extant wrinkles.

Fish and Omega-3 Fatty Acids

As  stated  above,  predatory  fish  such  as
albacore tuna, lake trout, mackerel, men-
haden,  and  salmon  are  high  in  omega-3
fatty acids. Salmon, in particular, is highly
regarded and readily available, as is tuna.
Salmon  contains  omega-3  and  omega-6
fatty  acids  that  help  human  skin  hold
onto  water,  inhibiting  transepidermal
water loss. The numerous omega-3 fatty
acids  in  salmon  (particularly  EPA  and
DHA) are also anti-inflammatory; there-
fore,  eating  salmon  may  help  curb  acne
and  facial  redness.  Patients  should  be
advised to select wild salmon because it
may have a greater abundance of omega-
3  fatty  acids  and  fewer  contaminants,
such  as  PCB,  as  compared  to  farmed
salmon.  The  author  recommends  eating
salmon at least 3 times a week.

Omega-3 fatty acids as well as omega-6
fatty acids are essential for healthy human
growth  and  development.  The  typical
Western diet had a typical ratio of omega-
6 to omega-3 fatty acids of 10:1 during the
mid-1990s,178 which  has  now  increased 
to  a  range  of  approximately  15:1  to
16.7:1.179 A healthy ratio is thought to be
closer to 4:1.178 A high ratio of omega-6 to
omega-3  fatty  acids  has  been  associated
with a greater risk for depression and vari-
ous  inflammatory  diseases.180 Omega-3
fatty acids exhibit significant anti-inflam-
matory activity. Good sources of omega-3
fatty  acids,  in  addition  to  the  fish  men-
tioned  above,  are  cod  liver  oil,  fish  oil,
flaxseeds,  and  flaxseed  oil.  Crushed  or
ground flaxseeds can make a healthy com-
plement to yogurt or oatmeal. Flaxseed oil

 
 
 
BOX 8-1 General Dietary Recommendations in Brief

1. Eat salmon at least 3 times per week.
2. Add ﬂaxseeds to your diet or use ﬂaxseed oil as a salad dressing.
3. Eat foods high in antioxidants, such as a wide variety of berries and pomegranates.
4. Eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and legumes—what nutritionists have been advising
for decades. In particular, eating fruits and vegetables that are in season is more nutritious.

5. Use spices such as oregano, ginger, and basil, all of which exhibit antioxidant properties.
6. Drink 2 to 4 cups of green tea per day.
7. Drink plenty of water (1 to 2 L a day, depending on level of exertion, humidity conditions, and

individual need).

8. Supplement with CoQ10, at least one 200 mg gel cap in the AM.
9. Drink a moderate amount of red wine, which contains the polyphenolic antioxidants resveratrol
and grape seed extract, both of which confer signiﬁcant antiaging beneﬁts. Consumption of too
much alcohol leads to free radical formation, which ages the skin.

10. Limit or avoid calorie-dense reﬁned sugars, saturated fats, and processed foods. Sugar can
contribute to acne and accelerate aging by causing the glycosylation of necessary proteins.
11. Following the premise that what is good for the digestion is good for the skin, eat smaller
portions (the typical American diet, particularly as evidenced by restaurant portions, over-
does this considerably), and chew slowly (ideally not while reading, watching TV, or
otherwise distracted).

It is important to note that these are general guidelines. Individual dietary needs may vary. In fact,

the BSTS system is founded on the notion that skin care needs vary according to skin type. (See
Table 8-8 for oral supplementation guidelines by BSTS.) Accordingly, some dietary needs or
restrictions can be categorized by skin type. It is worth noting that ancient medical systems that
continue in the present day—traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, from the Indian sub-
continent—base nutritional advice on evaluations of an individual’s constitution and their relative
deﬁcits upon examination. Ultimately, as we are learning in the West, one healthy diet plan does
not ﬁt all—individual tailoring is necessary.

For Vegetarians: To achieve the optimal level of essential fatty acid intake, vegetarians should follow
these practical guidelines: (1) Make a wide variety of whole plant foods the foundation of the
diet. (2) Derive the majority of fat from whole foods—nuts, seeds, olives, avocados, and soy
foods. (3) If using concentrated fats and oils, select those rich in monounsaturated fats, such as
olive, canola, or nut oils. Oils rich in omega-3 fatty acids can also be used but should not be
heated. Moderate use of oils rich in omega-6 fatty acids is advised. (4) Limit or avoid intake of
processed foods and deep-fried foods rich in trans and omega-6 fatty acids. (5) Reduce intake
of foods rich in saturated fat. (6) Include foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids in the daily diet
(ideally consuming 2–4 g ALA/d). (7) Consider using a direct source of DHA, ideally 100 to 
300 mg/d.

used as a salad dressing is a very healthy
approach  to  keeping  a  healthy  dish
healthy—many  standard  salad  dressings
are  high  in  sugar.  Omega-3  fatty  acids
may also assist in skin hydration, as these
compounds  have  been  shown  to  con-
tribute to improving eczema.

Antioxidants

Antioxidants  impart  protection  to  cells
from oxidative damage caused by exoge-
nous factors such as UV light, air pollu-
tion,  ozone,  cigarette  smoke,  and  even
oxygen  itself,  as  well  as  from  endoge-
nous  insult.  The  expression  “antioxi-
dant” is more of a reflection of the activ-
ity  exhibited  by  the  substance  rather
than its chemical family or constituency.
Antioxidants  include  carotenoids,  poly-
phenols,  vitamins,  and  other  classes  of
compounds.  A  diet  rich  in  various
antioxidants is strongly advised.

Skin Hydration

Skin hydration is a very important factor
in  achieving  and  maintaining  healthy
skin. The enzymes in the skin that per-
form a variety of functions need water to
work.  Without  water  skin  will  age
quicker  and  be  more  likely  to  itch  and
get red. EPO, black currant oil, and bor-
age oil are all good sources of the omega-
6  fatty  acid  GLA,  which  helps  prevent
water  evaporation 
the  skin.
Humans tend to lose approximately 2.5
liters  of  water  per  day.  This  is  partly
replenished  through  food  intake.  The
level  of  water  consumption  varies  by
individual, one’s level of activity, and cli-
mate, but 1 to 2 liters is probably a rea-
sonable estimate. One must drink water
to  prevent  becoming  dehydrated.
However, as far as skin is concerned it is
not how much water you drink but how
well  the  skin  holds  onto  the  water  and

keeps  it  from  evaporating.  Skin  needs
adequate levels of fatty acids, ceramides,
and  cholesterol  to  hold  onto  water  (see
Chapter 11). This is why vegans and peo-
ple  on  low-cholesterol  diets  or  choles-
terol-lowering drugs often have dry skin.
Any  liquid  can  provide  skin  hydration;
however,  water  consumption  should  be
increased  when  drinking  caffeine  and

Caloric Restriction

During the last several years, one focus
of  antiaging  research  has  included
examinations  oriented  toward  deter-
lifespan  and
mining  whether  the 
healthspan  of  human  beings  can  be
increased. In the process, caloric restric-
tion  (CR)  has  been  shown  to  prolong
the mean and maximum lifespan in var-
ious  species.181 It  is  not  yet  known
whether CR can extend the average and
maximum lifespan or the healthspan of
human  beings.  However,  available  epi-
demiologic  evidence  appears  to  suggest
that  CR  has  already  contributed  to
increased  lifespan,  average  and  maxi-
mum,  in  one  human  population—in
Okinawa,  Japan.182 It  is  important  to
note that restricting caloric intakes to the
extremes (as high as 60%) as performed

BOX 8-2—Dietary Quick Fixes

Alterations to one’s lifestyle to ensure long-term improvements are not easy to implement.

Patients are often in the market for short-term solutions for longer-term problems. Dietary
guidelines for overall health as well as cutaneous health and enhancement are geared toward
long-range beneﬁts, and can withstand or blunt the effects of occasional lapses. For the
patient who seeks to see a relatively quick change in the appearance of the skin through
nutrition alone, however, a few immediate steps can be taken, with the understanding that the
skin’s individual needs must also be taken into account. The following suggestions, based on
skin type or dietary restrictions, may be helpful:

For dry skin, increase omega-3 fatty acids, such as those in salmon, and other fatty acids and a

small amount of cholesterol to remain hydrated, and increase water consumption.

For oily skin, increase consumption of green leafy vegetables (e.g., kale and spinach), butternut

squash, cantaloupe, carrots, mangoes, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes, which are high in vitamin
A and will help decrease oil production.

For sensitive skin, as manifested through redness and facial ﬂushing, add omega-3 fatty acids, ﬁsh

in particular, as discussed above and antioxidants, which have anti-inﬂammatory effects.
For sensitive skin with the acne subtype, attention should be paid to concentrating on eating a diet

with a low glycemic load. In addition to consuming the foods just cited, foods high in vitamin A are
particularly beneﬁcial. Fruits and vegetables have lower glycemic loads than most foods.
Interestingly, given the reports and studies linking milk consumption and acne, dairy foods have
lower glycemic loads than fruits and vegetables.6 (The potential role of milk in the etiologic path-
ways of acne appears to involve other factors, however.) Grain products, and processed foods in
general, are to be avoided.

needs and cosmetic desires. But to fur-
ther  carry  the  banner  of  Hippocrates,
and to take a broader look at cutaneous
health  and  antiaging  approaches,  we
must  consider  food,  the  only  “medi-
cine”  that  all  individuals  require  on  a
daily basis. While the official or curric-
ular  attitudes  toward  nutrition  are
slowly changing, more rapidly accruing
evidence  suggests  that  nutrition  has  a
varied and complex role to play in over-
all  health  as  well  as  the  health  of  the
skin. Of course, much more research is
necessary, but enough data exist to sug-
gest that the old saw “you are what you
eat”  has  been  venerated  for  a  reason.
The  food  that  we  consume  does  exert
far-reaching  systemic  influences  that
have  the  potential  to  result  in  cuta-
neous manifestations.

level  has  been  demonstrated  to  confer
benefits  on  some  biochemical  and

sary  on  the  viability  of  expanding  the
life-  and  healthspan  of  humans,  one  of
the  cultural  practices  on  Okinawa—to
“...eat  until  you  are  80%  full”  (or  hara
hachi-bu)182—is  sound  advice  alone  to
help  stem  the  obesity  epidemic  that  is
afflicting an increasing proportion of the
global  population,  particularly  in  the
West. Such a practice would also likely
benefit  the  skin  if  the  individual  con-
sumes a healthy diet.

SUMMARY

Nutrition has long been ignored or given
short shrift in the Western medical com-
munity,  particularly  in  medical  school
education. This has also filtered into the
practice  of  dermatology,  perhaps  most
saliently  in  the  treatment  of  acne  as
manifested by dermatologists’ decades-
long attempts to debunk popular myths
regarding certain foods and the eruption
of  acne.  While  the  two  seminal,  and
admittedly flawed studies, that Cordain
cited played an influential role in derma-

tologists’  approaches  to  disabusing
patients  and/or  their  parents  of  the
myths linking certain foods to acne, the
myth  itself  has  often  been  misinter-
preted  by  the  public  and  physicians
have still offered sound basic nutritional
advice  (i.e.,  recommending  generous
portions  of  fruits  and  vegetables)  even
while  trying  to  refute  misinformation.
That  is  to  say,  in  the  public  mind,  the
myth took on an all-or-none implication
that  either  chocolate,  greasy  foods,  or
other  culprits  directly  caused  acne.  We
know now that the correlation between
diet  and  the  skin  is  more  convoluted.
One chocolate bar will not lead to acne
eruptions, but unhealthy eating patterns
can certainly contribute to the etiologic
pathway of acne.

Cosmetic  dermatologists,  while  on
the  front  lines  in  terms  of  treating  the
most  conspicuous  disorders  and,  in
many cases, diagnosing systemic condi-
tions  with  cutaneous  manifestations,
are 
increasingly  expected  to  help
patients  endogenously  and  exoge-
nously  maintain  the  appearance,  and
health,  of  the  skin  and  forestall  the
cutaneous  symptoms  of  aging.  With
ever-evolving  technology,  practitioners
are better and better equipped to offer
procedures  as  well  as  oral  and  topical
products  that  meet  patients’  health

The Baumann Skin
Typing System

Leslie Baumann, MD
Edmund Weisberg, MS 

The  modern  cosmetic  and  skin  care
product  market  began  to  take  shape  in
1915 amidst the intense rivalry between
the burgeoning cosmetics entrepreneurs
Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden,
both of whom opened salons that year
that would grow into powerful business
empires.  Since  that  period,  the  cate-
gories  “dry,”  “oily,”  “combination,”  and
“sensitive” have been used to character-
ize what Helena Rubinstein identified as
the four fundamental skin types. While
these  designations  were  the  virtually
undisputed standards for understanding
skin type, the skin care product and cos-
metics markets were growing exponen-
tially, evolving into an innovative multi-
billion  dollar  industry,  and  spawning  a
new  category  of  products  known  as
“cosmeceuticals,”  unregulated  cosmetic
formulations  that  may  impart  some
alteration  to  the  biologic  function  of
skin.  In  fact,  these  products  have
become so popular that relatively recent
sales figures indicated that $6.4 billion in
sales  of  skin  care  cosmeceuticals  were
projected in the US in 2004, an increase
of  7.3%  from  the  previous  year.1 Such
sales  expectations  have  since  been
exceeded,  as  by  spring  2006,  sales  of
cosmeceuticals  in  the  US  had  mush-
roomed to the $12 billion level.2

While  the  skin  care  product  market
has  changed  significantly  and  under-
gone  rapid  expansion  during  the  past
century,  relatively  few  advances  have
been  made  in  the  understanding  or
classification  of  skin  type.  Indeed,  the
traditional 
skin-type  designations
have,  in  practice,  come  to  be  seen  as
insufficient  characterizations  particu-
larly in terms of their capacity to guide
physicians  and  consumers  toward
identifying the most appropriate prod-
ucts.  This  is  especially  noteworthy
given that more and more products are
marketed  and  designed  for  specific
skin types, often dry or sensitive skin.
When  a  person  has  dry  or  sensitive
skin,  are  those  individual  descriptors
the only or defining features? The skin
types  identified  by  Rubinstein  do  not
address  several  other  features  of  skin

that  have  been  clinically  observed,
such as oiliness, resistance, or propen-
sities  toward  pigmentation  or  wrin-
kling.  The  Baumann  Skin  Typing
System 
innovative
approach  to  classifying  skin  type  that
is based on four main skin parameters:
1. Oily versus Dry;

(BSTS) 

is  an 

2. Sensitive versus Resistant;

3. Pigmented versus Nonpigmented;

4. Wrinkled versus Tight (Unwrinkled).

Because  these  four  parameters  are
not  mutually  exclusive,  evaluating  the
skin based on all four parameters yields
16  potential  skin-type  permutations
(Table  9-1). The  Baumann  Skin  Type
(BST)  classification  is  determined  from
a  questionnaire  designed  to  ascertain
baseline skin type identifications as well
as  assessments  after  significant  life
changes, since skin type is not necessar-
ily static.3

The BSTS is especially useful as it pro-
vides  specific  guidance  for  physicians
and  patients/consumers  to  identify  the
most  suitable  skin  products  for  the
patient’s BST.4 For example, significantly
different  skin  care  products  would  be
indicated  for  an  individual  with  dry,
resistant,  pigmented,  wrinkled  skin
(DRPW), as seen in Figure 9-1, compared
to  a  person  with  oily,  sensitive,  pig-
mented,  tight  skin  (OSPT),  as  seen  in
Figure 9-2. The BST is determined by a
questionnaire that is constantly updated
and improved as new data are collected.
The  questionnaire  and  a  complete
description  of  each  skin  type  including
product recommendations for each BST

TABLE 9-1
The 16 Baumann Skin Types

can be found in the book The Skin Type
Solution,  which  is  available  in  various
countries  and  several  languages.  Phy-
sicians and skin care specialists can join
the effort to collect skin-type data world-
wide and can access the most up-to-date
version  of  the  Baumann  Skin  Type
Indicator (BSTI) questionnaire online by
registering  at  www.SkinIQ.com.  The
BSTI is available in 10 languages at this
Web  site.  Once  registered  on  the  site,
the  skin  care  specialist  can  e-mail  the
link to the questionnaire to patients, so
that  patients  can  self-administer  the
examination.  The  result,  the  patient’s
BST, is available in a report to the physi-
cian  or  aesthetician.  They  can  deter-
mine not only an individual’s skin type,
but  also  which  skin  types  are  most
prevalent in their practice. More impor-
tantly,  skin  care  specialists  and  derma-
tologists  can  use  this  information  to
help  determine  which  products  and
procedures  are  most  appropriate  for
their patient populations. The question-
naire  (BSTI)  is  frequently  updated  fol-
lowing  the  evaluations  of  the  most
recent incoming data by statisticians. In
addition,  new  questions  are  developed
as  a  result  of  this  vetting  process.  The
nonidentifying  data  collected  from
the site should serve to expand knowl-
edge of skin-type prevalence around the
world.

This  chapter  will  discuss  the  four
parameters  on  which  the  BSTS  is
based,  briefly  focusing  on  their  defin-
ing  characteristics  and  pertinent  basic
science.  In  the  process,  the  16  skin-
type variations will be described. Each
of  the  four  skin  parameters  has  a

secretion. 
In  addition,  sunscreens,
which  are  often  soluble  in  oil,  may
increase  skin  greasiness  (see  Chapter
10).  Oily  skin  is  best  treated  with  a
cleanser directed to oily types. Foaming
cleansers  and  cleansers  with  salicylic
acid  can  be  used  on  these  patients.
Toners may be used in this skin type, if
desired, as well. Moisturizers are often
unnecessary  in  oily  skin  types.  If  they
are  used,  lighter  forms  such  as  lotions
should be chosen. Sebum contains high
levels  of  vitamin  E,  so  oily  skin  types
manifest  a  high  degree  of  antioxidant
protection.  Most  oily  skin  types  are
under the age of 40 years and may suf-
fer  from  acne  as  well.  Gel  and  serum
formulations are preferred over creams
in  oily  skin  types.  Layering  a  powder
over  sunscreen  may  help  reduce  the
greasiness that occurs in these patients
with sunscreen use.

Dry  skin  types  need  nonfoaming
cleansers  that  will  not  strip  protective
lipids  from  the  skin  surface.  While  the
skin  is  still  damp,  moisturizers  should 
be  applied  to  trap  water  on  the  skin’s
surface.  Toners  should  not  be  used  in
dry  skin  types.  Moisturizers  should  be
chosen based on their ability to decrease
transepidermal water loss and repair the
skin’s permeability barrier (see Chapter
32).  Extremely  dry  types  with  a  very
low  O/D  score  should  avoid  facial
scrubs  because  friction  is  known  to
impair  the  skin’s  permeability  barrier.
There  are  many  lotion  and  cream  sun-
screens on the market that are appropri-
ate for dry skin types.

Normal  skin  types  who  fall  in  the
middle  of  the  O/D  scoring  system  will
fare  well  with  a  lotion  formulation
rather than a gel or a cream formulation.
“Normal” skin types may change to dry
skin  types  in  low-humidity  environ-
ments or in cold weather.

SKIN SENSITIVITY

The Spectrum of Sensitive (S) to
Resistant (R)

A high score on the S/R spectrum corre-
lates  with  sensitive  skin,  while  a  low
score  represents  resistant  skin.  Sensitive
skin  is  characterized  by  inflammation
and  manifests  as  acne,  rosacea,  burning
and stinging, or skin rashes (see Chapter
12).  The  higher  the  “S”  score  is,  the
greater  is  the  likelihood  that  the  patient
has  several  types  of  sensitive  skin.  For
example, a patient with rosacea only will
have  a  lower  score  than  a  patient  with
rosacea  and  symptoms  of  burning  and
stinging.  These  S  scores  can  be  used  to

separate set of questions and a score is
assigned  to  that  parameter.  For  exam-
ple,  the  oily  and  dry  questions  deter-
mine if the user is an “O” or a “D” and
assigns  them  an  O/D  score  (Fig.  9-3).
Once  the  score  is  known,  skin  care
advice  can  easily  be  given.  Treatment
options or skin care approaches linked
to the BST will also be covered with an
emphasis  on  noninvasive,  primarily
topical therapies.

tion (see Chapter 11). Oily skin exhibits
increased sebum production (see Chapter
10).  Although  patients  can  complain  of
combination skin, dry on the cheeks and
oily in the T-zone, they often fall on one
end of the spectrum. Knowing their O/D
status  helps  simplify  their  skin  care.  In
the  BSTS,  a  higher  score  corresponds
with increased sebum production, while
a low score corresponds with decreased
skin hydration. Skin that falls in the mid-
dle  of  this  dichotomy  would  be  consid-
ered “normal” skin (Fig. 9-4).

Skin Care for the S to R Parameter

Individuals  with  resistant  “R”  skin  can
use most skin care products without fear
of incurring adverse reactions (e.g., acne,
rashes,  or  a  stinging  response).  On  the
other hand, the same qualities that pro-
tect  resistant  skin  from  most  formula-
tions also render many products ineffec-
tive  because  these  patients  exhibit  an
exceedingly  high  threshold  for  product
ingredient  penetration.  In  other  words,
resistant types have a strong skin barrier.
Therefore,  people  with  resistant  skin
may not benefit from weaker products,
which are unable to penetrate the SC of
such individuals to deliver the intended
results.  Resistant  patients  are  the  ones
who should be treated with higher lev-
els  of  glycolic  acid  and  will  require
longer incubation periods with Levulan
prior  to  photodynamic  therapy.  They
are  less  likely  to  develop  allergic  reac-
tions to skin care products that sensitive
types cannot tolerate.

Individuals  with  sensitive  skin  share
one  quality  in  common:  inflammation.
Treatment  is  geared  toward  preventing

refers to the fact that she has acne and rosacea-sensitive skin types 1 and 2). She tries to avoid sun but
lives in Miami and sunscreens usually make her sting or breakout. Her skin regimen should consist of a
salicylic acid or selenium sulﬁde cleanser, a serum with anti-inﬂammatory ingredients, a topical antibi-
otic, and a sunscreen with micronized zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Intense Pulsed Light treatments
will improve her solar lentigos and facial redness. Antioxidant supplements such as vitamin C 500 mg
twice a day and Pycnogenol 50 mg every day may help decrease the inﬂammation she experiences. Mild
salicylic acid chemical peels are an option as well.

determine what skin treatments are nec-
essary and which to avoid. Resistant skin
is  characterized  by  a  robust  stratum
corneum  (SC)  that  strongly  protects  the
skin from allergens, other environmental
irritants, and water loss. Individuals with

resistant skin rarely experience erythema
or acne (Fig. 9-5). In general, they can be
treated with stronger skin care products
and in-office procedures, such as chemi-
cal  peels,  than  can  those  with  sensitive
skin (Box 9-1).

of  pigmentary  alterations  that  can  be
prevented  or  improved  with  skin  care
products as well as dermatologic proce-
dures,  and  includes  conditions  such  as
ephelides,  melasma,  postinflammatory
hyperpigmentation,  and  solar  lentigos
(Fig. 9-7). Skin lesions that require exci-
sion or treatment beyond skin care (e.g.,
congenital nevi and seborrheic keratoses)
fall beyond the scope of the BSTS.

An  individual  with  a  propensity  to
develop  unwanted  pigmentary  changes
is classified as having the “P” skin type in
the BSTS system; a person not exhibiting
this tendency has type “N” skin (Fig. 9-8).

(cid:2) FIGURE 9-4 Oily skin types often show a light reﬂection or facial shine in photographs. People
with these skin types should use serums and gels rather than creams. If skin is combination (oily in
the T zone), then lotions are a good choice. Retinoids in the gel form are a good option for oily skin
types.

Skin Care for the P to N Parameter

Individuals  with  “N”  type  skin  do  not
require  any  special  skin  care  products.
However, the “P” skin types benefit from

and  reducing  irritation  and  inflammation
through  the  use  of  anti-inflammatory
products  (see  Chapter  35).  Because  there
are four distinct types of sensitive skin that
can  overlap,  skin  care  recommendations
depend on which type of sensitive skin or
which  combination  of  types  the  patient
exhibits. The issues to take into considera-
tion  when  choosing  a  skin  care  regimen
are discussed in the corresponding sensi-
tive  skin  Chapters  15  to  18.  In  general,
those  with  sensitive  skin  should  avoid
facial  scrubs  because  friction  impairs  the
skin barrier and can worsen acne.

SKIN PIGMENTATION

The Spectrum of Pigmented (P) to
Nonpigmented (N)

Skin  color  is  not  the  focus  here.
Although  darker  skin  types  are  more
likely  to  exhibit  the  “P”  (pigmented)
skin type, this parameter does not refer
to  ethnicity  (Fig.  9-6). Rather,  the  P/N
parameter  measures  the  tendency  to
develop  hyperpigmentation.  This  seg-
ment  of  the  BSTS  determines  those

“weathered.” This patient has the DRPW skin type. Daily sunscreen, alpha hydroxy acid moisturizers,
retinoids, and topical antioxidants should be added to her regimen. Australians, Latin Americans, and oth-
ers that live in a hot climate often have this skin type. This patient is an ideal candidate for a series of
chemical peels, dermal ﬁllers, and botulinum toxin.

four different spectra, yielding 16 differ-
ent  possible  skin-type  permutations.
The BSTS can lend valuable assistance in
the  process  of  treating  particular  skin
problems and selecting the most appro-
priate OTC products as well as dermato-
logic procedures for an individual’s par-
ticular  skin  type.  A  person  with  dry,
sensitive,  nonpigmented,  tight  skin
(DSNT),  for  example,  would  benefit
from  formulations  with  ingredients
designed  to  repair  the  skin  barrier 
(see  Chapter  32).  Products  containing
retinoids  and  antioxidants  would  be
most suitable for an individual with oily,
sensitive,  nonpigmented,  wrinkled  skin
(OSNW) because these individuals often
have  acne  and  a  tendency  to  wrinkle
(see Chapters 30 and 34). Product selec-
tion  should  also  be  made  with  the
understanding that particular skin traits,
tendencies, or conditions are associated
with  certain  skin  types.  For  example,  a
person  with  pigmented,  wrinkled  (PW)
skin is more likely to have a history of
chronic  sun  exposure,  manifesting  in
wrinkles and solar lentigos. Dark skin is
more  common  in  people  identified  as
having  pigmented,  tight  (PT)  skin,
whereas  light  skin  is  more  typical  in
individuals  characterized  as  having 
nonpigmented,  wrinkled  (NW)  skin.  In
addition, eczema is more often noted in
people  with  dry,  sensitive  (DS)  skin,
while acne is associated with oily, sensi-
tive (OS) skin. Rosacea is often observed
in individuals with the OSNW skin type.

(cid:2) FIGURE 9-6 Pigmented skin types develop solar lentigos, melasma, and postinﬂammatory hyperpig-
mentation. Although darker skin types are more likely to be pigmented types, this is not always the case. This
patient is a DRPT skin type. She avoids sun exposure and smoking and her skin tone may provide some pro-
tection from skin aging. The skin care recommendations include daily sunscreen, moisturizers, and skin-
lightening agents. Light chemical peels can be used with caution to even out skin tone. IPL cannot be safely
used because of her skin coloring; however, the Fraxel laser may be a good option when used by a physi-
cian experienced with skin of color. Asians and Latin Americans frequently have this skin type.

SKIN TYPE COMBINATIONS 
AND CHANGES

As stated previously, evaluating the four
skin  parameters  together  results  in  a
characterization  of  the  simultaneous
state  or  proclivities  of  the  skin  along

skin  lightening  ingredients  such  as
arbutin,  hydroquinone,  and  kojic  acid.
Products  with  niacinamide  and  active
soy  may  help  prevent  unwanted  pig-
mentation.  These  ingredients  are  dis-
cussed  at  length  in  Chapter  33.  Causes
of  skin  pigmentation  are  discussed  in
Chapter  13.  Intense  pulsed  light  and
Fraxel  treatments  are  useful  additions
for  many  patients  with  the  pigmented
BST  to  help  remove  unwanted  solar
lentigos or melasma.

SKIN AGING

The Spectrum of Wrinkled (W) to
Tight (T)

This  portion  of  the  BSTS  identifies  the
risk for wrinkles. The questionnaire asks
about  habits  such  as  sun  exposure,
smoking, and tanning bed use. In addi-
tion, it asks questions about the skin of
ancestors  to  ascertain  the  genetic  influ-
ence  on  wrinkled  skin.  The  “W”  types
may not necessarily have wrinkles at the
time that they complete the BSTI, but in
time they will need to begin prevention
methods  because  they  are  at  risk.
Individuals  with  lighter  skin  are  more
likely  to  manifest  “W”  type  skin  than
those  with  dark  skin.  Retinoids,  sun-
screen, and antioxidants should be used
in those who test out as a “W” type.

(cid:2) FIGURE 9-7 This patient is an ORPW skin type. A history of sun exposure and light skin color make
her  more  susceptible  to  wrinkling;  therefore, she  is  designated  as  a “tendency  to  wrinkle” type  even
though signiﬁcant wrinkling is not present. The vitamin E in her sebum may have offered some protection
from her frequent sun exposure. The best skin care regimen would include daily sunscreen, alpha hydroxy
acid cleansers, skin lighteners, retinoids, and oral and topical antioxidants. The IPL or Fraxel laser would
be great therapeutic options.

collect  data  and  provide  accurate  skin

to four dichotomous spectra, oily or dry,
sensitive or resistant, pigmented or non-
pigmented,  and  wrinkled  or 
tight
(unwrinkled),  yielding  a  four-letter  code
for skin type. Each letter of the skin type
designation  indicates  an  individual’s
tendency to develop that skin concern. A
patient’s  BSTI  score  provides  physicians
and  aestheticians  with  substantial  infor-
mation that can facilitate recommending
the most suitable OTC topical skin care
formulations  and  dermatologic  proce-
dures  for  that  patient.  The  BSTI  score
also  enables  the  individual  consumer  to
in
make  more 
selecting  the  most  appropriate  topical
treatments  for  their  skin  type.  Most
cutaneous needs of the 16 skin types can
be met by the wide array of available top-

ated  and  confusing.  The  BSTI,  a  self-
administered questionnaire to determine
the  BST,  can  be  used  to  simultaneously

Oily Skin

Mohamed L. Elsaie, MD
Leslie Baumann, MD

Sebum  production  plays  an  important
role  in  skin  hydration  by  producing
glycerol,  which  is  necessary  for  an
intact  skin  barrier.  In  addition,  sebum
supplies  lipids  to  the  surface  of  the
epidermis  that  may  aid  in  preventing
transepidermal water loss (TEWL) (see
Chapter 11). Excess sebum production
produces oily skin, and in many cases,
contributes  to  acne.  With  continuing
advances in understanding the physiol-
ogy  and  molecular  biochemistry  of
lipid
sebaceous  glands 
metabolism,  dermatologists  may  soon
be  able  to  elucidate  the  underlying
aspects  of  sebum  secretion  and  oily
skin.  This  chapter  will  focus  on  the
various known causes of oily skin and
their implications, a new classification
approach for determining the oily skin
type,  and  the  available  treatments  for
oily skin as well as the efficacy of these
treatments.

(SGs)  and 

COSMETIC IMPLICATIONS OF 
OILY SKIN

Oily  skin  is  a  common  complaint,1–7
especially in the adolescent age group.2
Those  with  moderate  to  severe  oily
skin complain of having to wash their
face several times a day, looking shiny
a  few  hours  after  washing,  frequent
streaking  of  facial  foundation,  and  an
inability  to  find  a  sunscreen  that  does
not  worsen  perceived  skin  oiliness.
These features of oily skin are disturb-
ing  to  women  and  men  alike  and  are
perceived  to  be  a  serious  cosmetic
problem leading to a negative self-per-
ception  and  possibly  affecting  social
interactions.  Clinically,  oily  skin  pre-
sents as lipid-laden secretions resulting
in a shiny appearance mostly over the
T-zone area (forehead, nose, and chin)4
(Fig. 10-1). SGs become large leading to
a  condition  known  as  sebaceous
hyperplasia, which is characterized by
0.5  to  1.5  mm  umbilicated  papules
found  in  the  T-zone  area  of  the  face
(Fig.  10-2).  In  addition,  many  patients
with oily skin complain of large pores.8

SEBACEOUS GLANDS

SGs are uni- or multilobular entities usu-
ally  associated  with  hair  follicles  that,
with hair follicles, form a structure known
as the pilosebaceous unit. The number of
SGs  remains  approximately  the  same
throughout life, whereas their size tends
to increase with age. SGs vary in size and
are  located  throughout  the  body  except
the palms and soles. The highest concen-
tration  of  SGs  is  found  on  the  face  and
scalp, but few are found on the lips. (This
is important because the lips have lower
vitamin E levels than the rest of the face
because of the lack of sebum.) Although
they are most frequently associated with
hair follicles, SGs are found in some non-
hair-bearing or glabrous areas such as the
eyelids,  where  they  are  called  “meibo-
mian glands” (Table 10-1).

Functions of Sebum

The exact function of sebum is not fully
understood. Current knowledge indicates
that  the  functions  of  the  SG  are  more
complex than previously thought. Sebum
is now known to play important roles in
the  three-dimensional  organization  of
skin surface lipids (SSL), the glycerol pro-
duction necessary for skin hydration, and
as  an  occlusive  moisturizing  agent.
Sebum protects the skin against oxidative
stress  because  it  contains  vitamin  E,  a
powerful antioxidant.9 Moreover, sebum
also exhibits innate antimicrobial activity
because it contains IgG, which is thought
to help prevent infection.10 Similarly, the
active cells of the sebaceous gland, sebo-
cytes, express both pro- and anti-inflam-
matory properties, are able to utilize cho-
lesterol  as  a  substrate  for  complete
steroidogenesis, present a regulatory pro-
gram  for  neuropeptides,  and  selectively
control the action of hormones and xeno-
biotics  on  the  skin.  The  importance  of
both  the  SG  and  sebum  production  in
skin homeostasis is further evidenced by
the  numerous  skin  disorders  associated
with  their  aberrant  activity.11–18 Of
course, the most common of such disor-
ders is acne ( Table 10-2).

SG Count

SG count can reach as high as 400 to 900
glands per cm2 on the face and less than
100  glands  per  cm2 elsewhere  in  the
body.19 Several studies have used differ-
ent  techniques  to  evaluate  SG  count.
Early studies that documented SG num-
bers  used  either  of  two  techniques:  the
indirect  or  the  direct.  Benfenati  and
Brilliantini,20 in  their  earliest  study  in
1939,  and  Powell  and  Beveridge,21 in
1970,  used  the  indirect  technique.  The
number  of  lipid-producing  orifices  per
cm2 of skin surface was measured using
osmium  tetroxide  at  room  temperature
to visualize the small areas of lipids on a
collecting paper left over the skin surface
for  7  minutes.  Adding  the  osmium
tetroxide produced tiny black spots that
were counted under a dissecting micro-
scope. The direct technique was used by
Cunliffe  et  al.  in  1974  using  a  surface
microscope.22 They  used  a  technique
that involved staining the skin with Oil
Red O (a lipophilic stain) and visualizing
with  a  Leitz  MZ  surface  microscope,
which  had  a  graticule  attached  to  the
eyepiece  allowing  the  diameter  of  the
pilosebaceous duct exit to be measured.
A  summary  of  the  techniques  and
results  is  displayed  in  Table  10-3.  As
stated  above,  the  number  of  SGs
remains almost constant throughout life,

whereas the size tends to increase with
age.

Sebaceous Structure and Secretion

Synthesis and discharge of the lipid con-
tent of the sebocytes takes more than a
week. The turnover of SGs is slower in
older  individuals  than  in  young  adults.
The  SG  is  composed  of  two  types  of
cells:  the  lipid-producing  cells  (sebo-
cytes) and the stratified squamous cells
lining  the  ductal  epithelium.  Sebocytes
pass through three stages to attain a full
mature  size,  namely,  the  undifferenti-
ated, differentiating, and mature stages.
As  the  sebocytes  pass  through  the  dif-
ferent maturation stages, the sebaceous
cells increase in size because of accumu-
lation of lipids and may undergo a 100-
to  150-fold  increase  in  volume.24 The
secretion mechanism of SGs is holocrine
via  rupture  of  individual  sebocytes
releasing  the  sebum,25 which  is  dis-
cussed  below.  Sebum  is  the  excretory
product  of  the  SGs.  It  is  a  mixture  of
nonpolar lipids synthesized by the SGs.
Human  sebum  contains  cholesterol,
cholesterol  esters,  fatty  acids,  diglyc-
erides,  and  triglycerides  in  addition  to
two  constituents  that  are  unique  to
sebum and not produced anywhere else
in the body: wax esters and squalene26–29
(Table  10-4 for  the  composition  of
human  sebum  as  compared  to  other
epidermal surface lipids).

Quantitative Evaluation of Sebum

As  a  determinant  of  the  oiliness  and
greasiness  of  skin,  evaluation  of  sebum
has long been a target of interest. Sebum
evaluation is performed on the skin sur-
face;  however,  not  all  SSLs  are  sebum
and, hence, understanding what SSLs are
and taking them into consideration is cru-
cial for an accurate estimation of sebum.

SSLs  have  a  dual  origin,  resulting  in 
a  mixture  of  epidermal  components
(secreted  by  the  mature  corneocytes 
and  composed  mainly  of  cholesterol,
cholestryl esters, triglycerols, ceramides,
and hydrocarbons) and sebaceous com-
ponents.30 Because SSLs are not equally
distributed over the surface of the body,
the  ratio  of  epidermal  lipids  to  seba-
ceous lipids depends on the body region
from  which  the  sample  is  collected.  In
1936,  Emanuel  reported  regional  varia-
tions  of  SSL  concentrations  in  different
regions  of  the  body.31 Body  regions
where the SSLs are comprised mainly of
the  sebaceous  component  (sebum)  are
the forehead, scalp, the upper part of the
trunk, and thorax; the epidermal compo-

Several sebum collection techniques have been
used in studies based on the above parame-
ters. Because of the large number of meth-
ods employed during more than 50 years of
research, some of the methods that con-
tributed to the basic knowledge of sebum are
mentioned here; special attention should be
focused on the newly developed techniques
that meet the expectations of current and
future research.

Extraction: The earliest sebum collection

technique. Based on the dissolution of SSLs
in an applied solvent to the skin, followed by
the solvent evaporation and the lipid residue
analysis.40,41

Cigarette paper techniques: Ether-soaked ciga-
rette papers applied in four sheets on the
forehead and kept in place by a rubber band.
This was followed by gravimetric measure-
ment of sebum.40,42

Sebutape method: A more accurate and faster
technique using a polymer ﬁlm for lipid
absorption. The polymer tape absorbs SSLs
and becomes transparent to light after-
wards. Sebutape can be analyzed in many
ways, the easiest of which is the visual
scoring of the tapes on a 1 to 5 scale43
(Fig. 10-3).

these areas, making such sites the most
suitable  for  the  evaluation  of  sebum
parameters with minimal interference of
epidermal lipids.32–35

Sebum  quantities  present  on  the  skin
surface  may  be  as  high  as  100  to  500
(cid:12)g/cm2, compared with quantities as low
as 25 to 40 (cid:12)g/cm2 of epidermal lipids.31,33
Two  parameters  are  used  for  measure-
ment  of  sebum:  the  casual  level and  the
sebum  excretion  rate.  Both  parameters

express only quantitative information and
do  not  give  sebum  qualitative  (con-
stituent)  information,  hence  chromato-
graphic techniques are required for subse-
quent constituent evaluation. A summary
of  both  parameters  is  concisely  high-
lighted  in  Table  10-5. Other  significant
evaluation parameters include the Sebum
Replacement  Time,  Follicular  Excretion
Rate, and the sustainable Sebum Excretion
Rate. (Box 10-1 for a summary of sebum
collection techniques.)

a computer for data management 45
(Fig. 10-4).

In comparing the Lipometre with the Sebumeter,
the latter is more practical. The Lipometre
has to be washed between each application,
whereas the Sebumeter procedure uses a
new strip with each measurement. Moreover,
the Sebumeter can be interfaced with a com-
puter. The Sebumeter and Sebutape are both
universally accepted as convenient instru-
ments. Although these devices do not directly
measure sebum, they are still useful as a
research aid to extrapolate sebum levels.46

FACTORS PREDISPOSING 
TO OILY SKIN

The exact mechanisms of sebum produc-
tion  have  not  been  elucidated  but  the
influential factors are thought to be mul-
tifactorial.  Retinoids,  hormones,  and
growth factors affect SG activity and dif-
ferentiation.  Androgens  have  long  been
thought  to  play  a  role  in  this  process
because sebum secretion increases when
puberty  begins  and  women  with  poly-
cystic ovarian disease exhibit acne. Acne
breakouts  tend  to  occur  right  before  a
woman’s  menstrual  cycle  and  a  recent
study  showed  that  menstruation  is
accompanied by dilatation of the pilose-
baceous  ducts  reaching  its  maximum
during ovulation and exhibiting the max-
imum  amount  of  sebum  secretion.8
However, the exact role of hormones in
acne is confusing as studies are conflict-
ing.  Testosterone  is  not  thought  to  be
directly  related  to  sebum  secretion
because although men have much higher
levels  of  testosterone  than  women  do,
their  sebum  secretion  rates  are  only
slightly  higher.47 The  weak  androgen
dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS)
may play a role in acne. DHEAS is con-
verted 
testosterone  by  several
enzymes  that  are  found  in  the  SGs,
including type 1 5-(cid:2)-reductase. However,
a type 1 5-(cid:2)-reductase inhibitor was not
found to be effective in the treatment of
acne.48 Estrogens,  insulin,  glucocorti-
coids,  and  prolactin  are  also  thought  to
influence  SG  function,  but  the  mecha-

to 

nisms  of  action  are  poorly  understood.
Insulin  growth  factor-1  (IGF-1)  expres-
sion is thought to play an important role
in  sebum  production  by  stimulating  SG
lipogenesis.49 IGF-1  increases  expression
of  a  transcription  factor  called  sterol
response  element-binding  protein-1
(SREBP-1).  SREBP-1  regulates  numerous
genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and
its  expression  stimulates  lipogenesis  in
sebocytes.50 Several  recently  discovered
receptors  such  as  the  liver  X  receptors
(LXRs)  and  the  peroxisome  proliferator-
activated  receptors  (PPARs)  have  been
shown to influence lipid metabolism and
increase  sebum  production  by  such
receptor  agonists.51,52 As  research  tech-
nologies  improve,  more  insight  into  the
processes  that  govern  sebum  secretion
will likely be gleaned.

STRESS AND SEBUM 
PRODUCTION

In  early  1972,  stress  was  shown  to  be
associated  with  an  increase  in  the
amount of free fatty acids on the skin.53
Since  then,  much  work  has  been
accomplished  to  evaluate  the  role  of
stress  in  sebum  production  and  acne.
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH),
also  known  as  a  stress  hormone,  has
been found in the SGs as has its receptor
CRH-R.54 CRH  directly  induces  lipid
synthesis  and  enhances  the  conversion
of  DHEAS  to  testosterone  in  sebo-
cytes.13,15 It is thought to play an impor-

tant role in the link between stress and
sebum  production.55 The  SG  also  pos-
sesses receptors for substance P, which is
a neuromediator released in response to
stress.56 In vitro, substance P stimulates
sebaceous  secretion.57 It  is  postulated
that substance P plays a role in acne as a
response to stress.

SEBUM AND GENETICS

Interestingly,  sebum  production  is  also
affected  by  genetic  make  up.  In  1989,
Walton  et  al.  suggested  in  one  study
that  acne  development  is  mediated
by genetic factors and only modified by
environmental factors.58 Their study of
20 pairs of homozygous twins versus 20
pairs  of  heterozygous  twins  demon-
strated equal sebum excretion in the 20
identical  pairs;  however,  the  identical
twins  exhibited  different  acne  severity
showing an environmental influence in
acne development. Conversely, the acne
severity  and  sebum  excretion  parame-
ters in the 20 nonidentical pairs of twins
were  significantly  different.  This  study
suggested that sebum excretion is under
genetic  control,  but  that  environmental
factors play a role in acne development.
In 2002, a study that examined 458 pairs
of monozygotic twins and 1099 pairs of
dizygotic twins implied a strong genetic
component in acne.59 This study did not
consider  sebum  secretion  rates;  how-
ever,  many  studies  have  demonstrated
increased sebum rates in acne patients.60

 
 
 
Predominance of an allele of the gene
cytochrome  P450  has  been  recently
reported in patients with hyperseborrhea.
Cytochrome  P450  is  a  large  supergene
family of enzymes involved in the metab-
olism of a wide range of endogenous and
foreign  compounds.  A  mutation  of
cytochrome  P450  could  lead  to  acceler-
ated  degradation  of  natural  retinoids,
which could cause disordered SG matura-
tion and secretion leading to oily skin.61

More recently, B lymphocyte-induced
maturation  protein  1  (Blimp1),  a  tran-
scription  factor,  was  identified  within
the  cells  of  the  sebaceous  glands.  One
study  revealed  that  Blimp1  acted  by
repressing  c-myc  gene  expression  in
mice.  Mice  without  Blimp1  c-myc
expression  demonstrated  an  increased
number  of  sebaceous  gland-containing
cells  that  divided  more  frequently.
Moreover,  these  SGs  were  enlarged,
which  in  turn  enhanced  the  numbers 
of  sebum-producing  sebocytes.  The
Blimp1-containing  cells  were  shown  to
be  the  progenitors  for  the  entire  seba-
ceous gland, and Blimp1 somehow con-
trols this progenitor population, regulat-
ing how many cells are allowed into the
gland.  Blimp1  is  thought  to  act  as  an
inhibitor for SG formation and secretion
through repressing the c-myc gene. This
study strongly supports the genetic basis
of sebum secretion rates.62,63

SUBJECTIVE VERSUS  
OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENTS 
OF SKIN OILINESS

When consumers shop for skin care prod-
ucts, they are often faced with choosing
among products designed and marketed
for  oily,  combination,  or  dry  skin.  They
are  obligated  to  determine  their  skin’s
barrier  status  and  sebum  secretion  rates
without any available objective measure-
ments. In other words, they are forced to
guess  their  skin  type.  Such  subjective
classification  is  often  incorrect.  One
study  enrolled  94  women  for  skin-type
evaluation  and  compared  the  findings
with the subjects’ own preconceived skin
types. The results showed that the sub-
jective  skin  type  does  not  match  the
amount of sebum secreted. The amounts
of  sebum  secretion  measured  by  the
Sebumeter  were  relatively  higher  than
what was expected by the study subjects.
Moreover,  for  those  who  preconceived
their skin type as dry, their skin type was
determined  to  be  oily  by  using  the
Sebumeter.64 As  mentioned  above,
patients’ estimation of their skin type is
subject to many biases. In addition, sea-

sonal  variations  in  sebum  secretion  can
confuse the issue.65

Simple  characterization,  such  as  oily,
dry, combination, and sensitive, based on
subjective assessments is not a very use-
ful  tool  for  classifying  skin  types.  The
data  available  on  the  various  skin  types
by  the  early  skin  classification  systems
have been inconsistent. No one system of
classification  was  able  to  identify  any
prevalence  or  characterization  of  a  spe-
cific skin type.1 In 2005, a novel approach
for assessment and categorization of skin
types  was  published.  This  method  uti-
lizes a validated questionnaire, known as
the Baumann Skin Type Indicator (BSTI),
to determine skin type66 (see Chapter 9).

THE BAUMANN SKIN TYPING
SYSTEM AND DETERMINING
OILY SKIN

The  BSTI  is  a  comprehensive,  self-
administered  questionnaire  divided  into
four parts. The first part of the question-
naire  determines  the  occurrence  and
severity  of  oily  skin  based  on  historical
data.  Answers  for  each  of  the  11  ques-
tions  are  translated  into  a  point  system
and  accordingly  the  skin  type  is  desig-
nated  as  either  an  oily  (O)  or  a  dry  (D)
type and assigned a score that determines
severity of oiliness or dryness (Fig. 10-5).

BSTS and Ethnic Skin Variations

Many  endogenous  and  exogenous  fac-
tors,  as  indicated  earlier,  are  known  to
affect sebum secretion and skin oiliness.

Ethnic  differences  in  sebum  secretion
have not been well studied. Most of the
available  reports  on  oily  skin  are  based
on  the  Caucasian  human  model;  there-
fore,  less  is  known  about  sebum  secre-
tion in darker skin types. In spite of this,
many  myths  abound  that  darker  skin
types  have  increased  sebum  secretion.
In  the  few  studies  performed,  this  has
not  been  shown  to  be  the  case.  One
study by Grimes et al. compared instru-
mental  measurements  for  sebum,  pH,
corneometry 
(skin  moisture),  or
transepidermal water loss (barrier func-
tion)  and  found  no  difference  between
African Americans and Caucasians.67

A  recent  study  at  the  University  of
Miami used the BSTS to look for ethnic
differences  in  skin  type.  This  unpub-
lished  study  included  399  subjects  of
four different ethnic groups: Caucasians,
African  Americans,  Hispanics,  and
Asians.  Categorization  of  skin  type
according  to  the  BSTS  was  used  and
each  of  the  study  subjects  was  desig-
nated a skin type. The percentage of oily
skin  subjects  among  each  ethnic  group
was  in  ascending  manner:  Caucasians
(47.13%),  Hispanics  (55.88%),  Asians
(57.70%),  and  African  Americans
(61.9%). This study was the first to use
the BSTS to compare ethnic differences
and  demonstrates  some  variability  in
skin  types  by  ethnicity.  Although  it
reports  an  increased  incidence  of  oily
skin  among  African  Americans,  it  is
important  to  realize  that  all  subjects
were  being  treated  in  a  general  derma-
tology  clinic  in  Miami  and  therefore
may not be representative of the general
population.

Other studies have shown black sub-
jects to have 60% to 70% more lipids in
their  hair  compared  with  white  sub-
jects.  Another  study  suggested  an
increased  pore  number  and  sebaceous
secretion  among  African  Americans
compared  to  other  racial  groups.68
Ethnic  skin  differences  in  skin  lipids
remain  inconclusive  given  the  discrep-
ancies  in  study  results.  Despite  the
paucity of available data on ethnic skin
differences  and  surface  lipid  variations
among  different  ethnic  groups,  the
majority of available studies suggest an
existing  disparity  in  skin  of  color  as
compared to lighter skin tones. Further
research is needed to be able to identify
the exact areas of differences in order to
develop  optimum  regimens  for  target-
ing ethnic skin conditions.

CHANGE IN SEBUM 
PARAMETERS IN PATIENTS 
WITH ACNE

It is generally and scientifically accepted
that the severity of acne correlates, and
is  directly  proportional,  to  the  sebum
secretion  level.69 However,  the  correla-
tion  of  sebum  excretion  rates  and  acne
has  been  a  subject  of  debate  since  the
early 1960s when Fry and Ramsay mea-
sured  sebum  excretion  in  17  acne
patients and reported that there was no
direct  relation  of  the  sebum  excretion
rate  to  acne  severity.70 Cunliffe  and
Shuster,  using  a  better  collection  tech-
nique  in  the  late  1960s,  demonstrated
that  sebum  excretion  is  directly  related
to  the  severity  of  acne.71 Many  recent
studies have indicated that sebum levels
are  indeed  higher  in  the  acne  popula-
tion. Piérard et al. demonstrated a higher
overall  sebum  excretion  rate  in  acne
subjects  when  studying  it  on  the  fore-
head  using  the  Lipometre.5 Piérard-
Franchimont et al. noted a change in the
rate of sebum excretion directly propor-
tional  to  the  severity  of  acne.72 Harris 
et  al.  used  disks  of  fine  Dacron  mesh
embedded  in  fresh  clay  to  report  that
inflammatory acne patients had a higher
sustainable  rate  of  sebum  excretion.73
Recently, Kim et al. confirmed increased
sebum  secretion  rates  in  subjects  with
acne using the Sebumeter in a study on
36  Asian  patients.74 However,  it  is
important  to  realize  that  even  though
acne  is  associated  with  high  sebum
rates, all patients with high sebum rates
do not develop acne. Patients with high
sebum rates and no acne are classified as
oily  resistant  types  in  the  BSTS  (see
Chapter 9).

Acne  vulgaris  is  a  disease  of  the
pilosebaceous unit. Acne is a multifacto-
rial  condition  with  distinct  pathologic
factors  including  increased  sebum  pro-
duction, ductal hypercornification, colo-
nization  of  ducts  by  Propionibacterium
acnes (P. acnes), and inflammation.2 For a
full  review  on  acne  vulgaris,  refer  to
Chapter 15. PPARs (cid:2), (cid:3), and (cid:13) may play
a role in acne and increased sebum pro-
duction.  These  receptors  have  been
identified in sebocytes, with the (cid:13) form
being  the  most  important.  Free  fatty
acids,  linoleic  acid,  and  androgens  acti-
vate these receptors, which bind to RXR
retinoid  receptors  (in  the  formation  of
heterodimers) inducing modifications of
sebocyte  proliferation  and  differentia-
tion as well as the synthesis of free fatty
acids.  PPARs  are  therefore  involved  in
the maturation of the SGs and initiation
of  the  inflammatory  reaction  in  acne.
The PPARs present in the SGs of hyper-
seborrheic patients are at a higher level,
suggesting  a  disordered  effect  on  the
natural  retinoids  and  leading  to  the
development of acne.68

SEASONAL SKIN TYPE:
MYTH OR REALITY?

Many patients self-report seasonal vari-
ability  in  self-perceived  “oily  skin.”
Strauss et al. suggested that there is no
evidence  for  seasonal  changes  in  SG
activity,  although  the  skin  may  appear
oilier in hot weather because of changes
in the viscosity of SSLs, making the skin
feel oilier.19 In addition, sebum excretion
rates  have  been  shown  to  be  increased
with  exposure  to  higher  temperatures;
however,  this  measure  may  reflect  a
change  in  sebum  collection  methods
(increased  uptake  of  sebum  on  collec-
tion  paper)  used  to  measure  sebum
production  rather  than  an  actual
increase  in  sebum  production.75
In
2005, Youn et al. observed regional and
seasonal variations in sebum secretion
that  led  to  changes  of  skin  type  from
dry  to  oily,  resulting  in  what  they
termed  a  “combination  skin  type.”65
This was the first study to show sebum
changes  throughout  different  seasons.
Forty-six patients were included in the
study  and  their  sebum  secretion  was
measured  over  an  entire  year.  They
reported  that  summer  was  the  only
season  in  which  a  significant  increase
in  sebum  secretion  was  seen.  In  addi-
tion,  a  reduction  in  the  dry  skin  type
and an increase in the oily type based
on  their  categorization  system  was
recorded in the summer.

SEBOSUPPRESSIVE AGENTS

Topical Agents

Although  many  products  claim  to
inhibit  sebum  production,  very  few,  if
any,  have  been  conclusively  proven  to
work. Most oil control products on the
market  contain  talc  and  other  oil-
absorbing  components  that  mask  or
absorb oil rather than function as sebum
production  inhibitors.  Antiandrogens
such  as  ketoconazole  and  spironolac-
tone  have  shown  some  effects.76,77
Progesterone has demonstrated a short-
term  effect  (2–3  months)  when  applied
topically in women. However, it has not
reduced  sebum  excretion  rates 
in 
men.78 Corticosteroids,  erythromycin-
zinc  complex,  elubiol  (dichlorophenyl
imidazoldioxolan),  and  recently  an
extract  from  saw  palmetto,  sesame
seeds,  and  argan  oil  have  all  been  used
for  this  purpose.79–82 Notably,  topical
retinoids  have  not  been  shown  to
decrease sebum secretion.83

Systemic Agents

The  most  potent  pharmacologic
inhibitor  of  sebum  secretion  is  the
retinoid  isotretinoin  (13-cis
retinoic
acid).  Reductions  in  sebum  excretion
rates can be reduced by 90% as early as
2  weeks  after  initiating  treatment  with
isotretinoin.  Its  exact  mechanism  of
action  has  not  been  fully  described  or
understood  yet,  but  histologically  it
shrinks  the  SG  size  and  the  sebocytes
lose their characteristic interior accumu-
lation of lipids.2,84 Hypothesized mecha-
nisms of action of 13-cis retinoic acid in
reducing sebum are listed in Table 10-6.

In-ofﬁce Procedures
In  a  2006  study,  chemical  peels  using
30%  glycolic  acid  solution  and  Jessner’s
solution  were  not  shown  to  decrease

sebum secretion  rates  as  measured  by  a
Sebumeter.86 Photodynamic therapy using
blue light and 5-ALA (aminolevulinic acid)
failed  to  demonstrate  changes  in  sebum
excretion  rates,  although  improvement
was observed in ace lesions, as reported in
2007.87 Microdermabrasion  has  not  been
shown to decrease sebum excretion rates.
Further,  it  is  important  for  practitioners
and  patients  alike  to  understand  that  at
this  time,  there  are  no  known  in-office
procedures  that  reduce  sebum  excretion
rates.

SUMMARY

Oily  skin  is  not  an  uncommon  condi-
tion.  It  presents  in  varying  degrees  in
both men and women. Excessive sebum
secretion (hyperseborrhea) is influential
in  the  ascertainment  of  skin  type.  The
condition  ranges  from  a  mild  cosmetic
burden  to  a  true  skin  disease  manifest-
ing  as  acne.  Improvements  in  genetic
research,  objective  skin  typing,  and
more  accurate  measurement  of  sebum
levels  will  lead  to  an  enhanced  under-
standing of sebum and the mechanisms
that affect its excretion rates.

Dry Skin

Leslie Baumann, MD

Dry skin, also known as xerosis, can be a
congenital or acquired condition. It can
be so mild that it is hardly noticed or so
severe  that  it  leads  to  skin  breakdown,
severe  itching,  and  infection.  Mild  dry
skin  is  a  condition  that  affects  many
patients and is often a complaint of cos-
metic  patients  in  particular.  Billions  of
dollars  a  year  are  spent  worldwide  on
moisturizing  skin  care  products.  It  is
important,  therefore,  for  the  cosmetic
dermatologist  and  cosmetic  scientist  to
understand the underlying causes of dry
skin and how current therapies treat this
condition.

There  are  so  many  products  on  the
market to treat skin dryness that one can
become easily overwhelmed. This chap-
ter will discuss what is known about the
causes  of  dry  skin  with  an  eye  toward
elucidating  issues  that  must  be  under-
stood in order to identify the most effec-
tive products or the ones best suited to
particular skin types.

WHAT IS DRY SKIN?

Dry skin is characterized by the lack of
moisture  in  the  stratum  corneum  (SC).
Water  is  the  major  plasticizer  of  the
skin,  and  when  levels  are  low,  cracks
and  fissures  occur.1 For  the  skin  to
appear  and  feel  normal,  the  water  con-
tent  of  the  SC  must  be  greater  than
10%.2 The  increase  in  transepidermal
water loss (TEWL) that leads to dry skin
results when a defect in the permeability
barrier allows excessive water to be lost
to  the  atmosphere.  This  barrier  pertur-
bation is caused by several different fac-
tors  such  as  harsh  detergents,  acetone
and  other  contactants,  and  frequent
bathing.  When  skin  becomes  too  dry,
the  outer  skin  layers  stiffen  and  may
develop  cracks.  The  cracks  become  fis-
sures into the skin that become irritated,
inflamed,  and  itchy.  The  condition  is
worse  in  areas  of  the  body  with  rela-
tively  few  oil  glands  such  as  the  arms,
legs, and trunk (Box 11-1).

Alterations  in  the  epidermal  lipid
component  of  the  skin  can  also  cause
xerosis.  Some  dermatologists  believe

BOX 11-1 Transepidermal Water Loss

Kligman discussed his observations on the
efﬁciency of the epidermal water barrier as a
structure to prevent TEWL in a text in 1964.3
He described covering the oriﬁce of an
inverted vial of water with a sheet of SC. This
sheet of SC tissue prevented water evapora-
tion. TEWL is now used as a measure of the
integrity of the SC. TEWL is deﬁned as insen-
sible water loss through the skin. It is not the
same as active perspiration. TEWL is mea-
sured in two ways. The ﬁrst is using a device
called an evaporimeter, which calculates the
gradient of the humidity at the skin’s surface.
The second way to gauge TEWL is to use
devices that measure capacitance or conduc-
tance. Speciﬁcally, these devices measure the
electrical capacitance in the skin that is
altered by skin hydration. This is actually a
measure of hydration of the SC rather than a
measure of TEWL; however, the rate of water
loss can be extrapolated using capacitance
measurements. In order to increase the valid-
ity of the results, it is very important to per-
form both of these types of measurements in
climate-controlled conditions with minimal air
currents. Skin hydration is most accurately
assessed using several methods including
clinical correlation.

that  the  incidence  of  dry  skin  has
increased in recent years because people
bathe  and  shower  frequently  using  hot
water,  foaming  cleansers,  fragranced
bubble  baths,  and  bath  salts,  which
impair  the  skin’s  barrier  by  stripping
away important lipids. Soap, detergents,
and hard water can wash off the healthy
and normal barrier of the skin.

The  preponderance  of  people  who
complain of having dry skin do not have
an  underlying  disease  but,  rather,  lack
the  ability  to  cope  with  environmental
elements that adversely affect the water-
binding  capacity  of  the  SC.  Table  11-1
lists agents in the environment that can
cause dry skin. Generally, as people age

their skin tends to become drier and less
oily. Dry skin occurs more during the fall
and  winter  months  because  of  low
humidity  and  excessive  bathing  in  hot
water.  Xerosis  is  often  called  “winter
itch” because it is at its worst during that
season.

Clinical Signs

The first clinical sign of skin dryness is a
dull,  gray  white  color  and  increased
topographic  skin  markings4 (Fig.  11-1).
As the drying worsens, the loss of water
causes  a  loss  of  cohesiveness  between
the corneocytes and abnormal retention
of  desmosomes.  The  edges  of  the  cor-
neocytes curl up much like shingles on a
roof  curl  up  in  extremely  arid  condi-
tions. The loosening of entire sheets of
corneocytes  results  in  scaling  and  flak-
ing. The entire skin surface feels rough.
Its  appearance  is  dull  because  a  rough
surface is less able to refract light than a
smooth  surface.  The  skin  may  feel  less
pliable  with  stretching  and  bending;
cracks and fissures can occur as a result
of  this  reduced  elasticity.  Xerosis  and
impaired  epidermal  barrier  can  also  be
components in genetic disorders or con-
ditions  with  genetic  predisposition,
including ichthyosis and atopic dermati-
tis (Box 11-2).

Dry or Oily Skin?

Many  patients  describe  themselves  as
having either dry or oily skin. In reality,
however,  these  two  processes  are  not
mutually exclusive. Dry skin is caused by
a lack of moisture in the SC. Oily skin is
caused  by  increased  secretion  of  the
sebaceous  glands.  It  is  possible  to  have
dry skin on parts of the face and oily skin
in  the  T-zone  area.  This  is  commonly
called combination skin. In addition, one
may have oily skin on the face and dry
skin  on  the  body  because  of  a  lack  of
sebaceous glands on the arms and legs.

ETIOLOGY OF DRY SKIN

Dry  skin  is  a  result  of  decreased  water
content in the SC, which leads to abnor-
mal  desquamation  of  corneocytes.5 SC
hydration is largely a property of corneo-
cytes  within  the  outer  SC  (stratum  dis-
junctum), because corneocytes within the
lower  SC  (stratum  compactum)  are  rela-
tively  dehydrated  and  unable  to  absorb
water  when  exposed  to  hypotonic

BOX 11-2 Atopic Dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis is a multifactorial disorder
characterized by dry skin. Multiple studies
have suggested that an insufﬁciency of
ceramides in the skin is an important patho-
physiologic factor in this condition.37
However, in a study that looked at patients
with “xerosis,” the deﬁciency in water-hold-
ing properties was not accompanied by an
insufﬁciency of ceramides.38 Researchers
also found that sebum levels did not play a
signiﬁcant role in the etiology of xerosis
when studied in atopic patients. They
hypothesized that xerosis could be caused by
an aberration of the lamellar structures of
intracellular lipids in the SC.

Interestingly, mutations in the ﬁlaggrin
gene have been described in patients with
atopic dermatitis.39,40 In fact, ﬁlaggrin muta-
tion is the ﬁrst strong genetic factor identi-
ﬁed in atopic dermatitis. A defect in ﬁlaggrin
would result in a structural cutaneous defect
because it normally aggregates with keratin
ﬁlaments in the stratum granulosum to form
macroﬁlaments that impart strength to this
layer.41 In addition, a defect in ﬁlaggrin would
lead to a decrease in NMF, a by-product of
ﬁlaggrin that has hygroscopic properties. A
decrease in secretions of lamellar bodies,
which would lead to a decrease in fatty acids
and ceramides, has been reported in atopic
dermatitis patients.42

stress.6,7 Rawlings  et  al.  demonstrated
that desmosomes remain intact at higher
levels  of  the  SC  and  desmoglein  I  levels
remain  elevated  in  the  superficial  SC  of
individuals with dry skin as compared to
controls.8 This  occurs  because  the
enzymes necessary for desmosome diges-
tion are impaired when the water level is
insufficient,  which  leads  to  abnormal
in  visible
desquamation 
“clumps”  of  corneocytes  that  cause  the
rough  and  dry9
skin 
(Fig. 11-2A and B). These clumps of cor-
neocytes lead to the phenotype known as
dry  or  scaled  skin.  In  darker  skin  types,
this  perturbation  of  desquamation  is
associated with a grayish skin color and
is  labeled  “ashy  skin.”  Essentially,  ashy
skin is dry skin in a dark-skinned person.
The skin barrier resembles a brick and
mortar  type  structure  with  the  bricks
representing  the  keratinocytes  and  the
mortar  mimicking  the  lipids  that  sur-
round  the  keratinocytes  in  a  protective
coating. The lipids are arranged in lipid
bilayers as illustrated in Figure 11-3. The
skin  barrier  exhibits  several  important
functions  such  as  preventing  evapora-
tion of water, which is known as TEWL.

The  barrier  also  helps  keep  out
unwanted compounds such as allergens
and irritants. Injured barriers render one
more susceptible to contact and irritant
dermatitis. Lastly, the barrier displays a
defensive  role  or  mechanism  against
infections and this SC defense depends
on  corneocyte  function  and  the  sur-
rounding extracellular matrix.10

THE SKIN BARRIER
Corniﬁed Cell Envelope

The  cornified  cell  (CE)  envelope  that
encases the corneocyte is a 10-nm insol-
uble  layer  composed  of  several  highly
crossed  proteins.  Loricrin,  the  main
component  of  this  envelope,  and  other
proteins  such  as 
involucrin,  small
proline-rich  proteins,  desmoplakin,  and
periplakin  are  cross-linked  by  the  cal-
cium  (Ca2+)-dependent  tranglutaminase
1 (TG-1) enzyme to form this structure.11
Defects  in  CE  envelope  proteins  or  the
TG-1 enzyme result in genetic disorders
with impaired cornification, resulting in
the  phenotype  of  severely  dry  skin.
Lamellar  ichthyosis  and  Vohwinkel’s

syndrome are examples of TG-1 and lori-
crin defects, where impaired skin barrier
is clearly present.

Extracellular Matrix and SC Lipids

The extracellular matrix surrounding the
corneocyte  is  a  lipid-rich  component
necessary for maintaining the epidermal
barrier.  Lamellar  bodies  that  are  secre-
tory  organelles  located  in  the  stratum
granulosum  play  a  key  role  in  forming
this  lipid  bilayer  barrier  by  releasing
their contents in the junction of the stra-
tum granulosum and SC. They contain a
mixture of lipids (ceramides, cholesterol,
and 
lipid-processing
enzymes, proteases (responsible for epi-
their
dermal  desquamation),  and 
inhibitors.

fatty  acids), 

This  extracellular  lipid  of  the  SC  is
well  known  to  be  responsible  for  that
layer’s water barrier function.12 The lipid
mixture  that  is  delivered  by  lamellar
bodies  is  composed  of  50%  ceramides,
approximately  15%  fatty  acids,  and
approximately  25%  cholesterol.13 It  has
been  stated  that  alterations  in  any  of
these  three  components  can  cause  a

disruption in barrier function. There are
three  rate-limiting  enzymes  involved  in
the  synthesis  of  the  main  lipids  of  epi-
dermal  skin  (Fig.  11-4).  They  include 
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl  coenzyme
A (HMG-Co A) reductase (the rate-limit-
ing  enzyme  in  cholesterol  synthesis),
acetyl Co-A carboxylase (ACC), and the
fatty acid synthase involved in the syn-
thesis  of  free  fatty  acids  and  palmitoyl
transferase  (SPT),  which  is  the  regula-
tory  enzyme  for  the  synthesis  of
ceramides.14,15 As  expected,  when  skin
barrier disruption occurs, the activity of
these  enzymes  is  enhanced  in  order  to
compensate for barrier dysfunction.15 In
addition, a group of transcription factors
known  as  sterol  regulatory  element
binding  proteins 
(SREBPs)  regulate
cholesterol  and  fatty  acid  synthesis.
When  decreased  epidermal  sterols  are
noted, the SREBPs are activated via pro-
teolytic processes, enter the cell nucleus,
and  activate  genes  leading  to  increased

synthesis of cholesterol and FA synthe-
sis enzymes.10,16 There are three known
types  of  SREBPs:  SREBP-1  a,  -1  c,  and
SREBP-2. 
In  human  keratinocytes,
SREBP-2  has  been  shown  to  be  the
predominant one and involved in regu-
lating  cholesterol  and  FA  synthesis.17
Interestingly,  the  ceramide  pathway  is
not affected by the SREBPs.

CHOLESTEROL Basal  cells  are  capable  of
absorbing  cholesterol  from  the  circula-
tion;  however,  most  cholesterol  is  syn-
thesized from acetate in cells such as the
keratinocytes.  The  synthesis  of  choles-
terol  is  increased  when  the  epidermal
barrier is impaired.18 Peroxisome prolif-
erator-activated  receptors  (PPARs)  and
retinoid X receptors have been found to
play  a  role  in  transporting  cholesterol
across  keratinocyte  cell  membranes  by
increasing  expression  of  ABCA1,  a
membrane  transporter  that  regulates
cholesterol efflux.19

CERAMIDES Ceramides  constitute  40%
of  the  SC  lipids  in  humans20;  however,
they are not found in significant amounts
in lower levels of the epidermis such as
the  stratum  granulosum  or  basal  layer.
This  suggests  that  terminal  differentia-
tion is a key factor in the production of
ceramides. There are at least nine classes
of  ceramides  in  the  SC  classified  as
Ceramides 1 to 9. In addition, there are
two  protein-bound  ceramides  classified
as Ceramides A and B, which are cova-
lently  bound  to  cornified  envelope  pro-
teins  such  an  involucrin21 (Fig.  11-5). 
In  1982,  Ceramide  1  was  the  first
ceramide identified. Subsequently, addi-
tional  types  of  ceramides  were  found
and named according to the polarity and
composition of the molecule. The basic
ceramide  structure 
is  a  fatty  acid
covalently  bound  to  a  sphingoid  base.
Different  classes  are  based  on  arrange-
ments  of  sphingosine  (S)  versus  phy-
tosphingosine  (P)  versus  6-hydroxysph-

ingosine  (H)  bases,  to  which  an  (cid:2)-
hydroxy  (A)  or  nonhydroxy  (N)  fatty
acid is attached, as well as the presence
or  absence  of  a  distinct  (cid:14)-esterified
linoleic  acid  residue.22 Ceramide  1  is
unique  because  it  is  nonpolar  and  con-
tains  linoleic  acid  (a  fatty  acid).  It  is
believed  that  the  unique  structure  of
Ceramide 1 gives it a special function in
the  SC.  Many  have  proposed  that  this
unique structure allows it to function as
a  molecular  rivet  to  bind  the  multiple
bilayers of the SC.20 This sort of interac-
tion can account for the stacking of lipid
bilayers  that  is  observed.  Ceramides  1,
4,  and  7  play  a  vital  role  in  epidermal
integrity by serving as the main storage
areas for linoleic acid, an essential fatty
acid with key functions in the epidermal
lipid  barrier.23 Although  all  epidermal
ceramides are generated from a lamellar
body-derived  glucosylceramide  precur-
sor,  sphingomyelin-derived  ceramides
(Ceramides  2,  5)  are  also  necessary  for
the  integrity  of  the  epidermal  barrier.24
Alkaline  pH  inhibits  the  activity  of  (cid:3)-

glucocerebrosidase  and  acid  sphin-
gomyelinase.25 Therefore, alkaline soaps
may  contribute  to  poor  barrier  forma-
tion.

The regulatory enzyme for ceramide
synthesis (SPT) is increased via exposure
to  UVB  radiation  and  cytokines.26 A
study  by  L’Oréal  researchers  showed
that  total  ceramide  levels  (especially
Ceramide 2) are decreased in skin xero-
sis.27 They  did  not  see  a  difference  in
total  lipid  amount  between  xerotic
patients and controls.

A study by Unilever demonstrated that
exogenously applied sphingoid precursors
(specifically  tetraacetyl  phytosphingosine
or TAPS) increased ceramide levels in ker-
atinocytes.28 Another  study  by  Unilever
showed  that  TAPS  combined  with  the
fatty  acids  1%  linoleic  acid  and  1%
juniperic  acid  further  increased  these
ceramide levels.29 In the second study, bar-
rier integrity was also assessed and shown
to  be  improved  in  patients  treated  with
TAPS, and even more improved in those
treated with TAPS as well as linoleic and

juniperic acids. These results suggest that
topically applied lipid precursors are incor-
porated into ceramide biosynthetic path-
ways  in  the  epidermis,  increasing  SC
ceramide  levels  and  thereby  improving
barrier integrity.

FATTY  ACIDS The  skin  contains  free
fatty  acids  and  fatty  acids  bound
in triglycerides,  glycosylceramides,
ceramides, and phospholipids. The free
fatty acids in the SC are predominantly
straight  chained,  with  24  to  24  carbon
chain  lengths  being  the  most  abun-
dant.18 Acetyl Co-A carboxylase (ACC)
and fatty acid synthase are the rate-lim-
iting  enzymes  in  fatty  acid  synthesis.
Barrier  disruption  increases  the  mRNA
and  activity  levels  of  both  of  these
enzymes resulting in de novo fatty acid
synthesis.  (The  increase  in  activity  of
these  enzymes  is  likely  caused  by  an
increase in SREBPs.) Essential fatty acids
such  as  linoleic  acid  can  only  be
obtained  through  diet  or  by  topical
application.

Changes  in  any  of  the  three  lipid
components  (ceramides,  cholesterol,
and  fatty  acids)  or  their  regulatory
enzymes result in impairment of the epi-
dermal  barrier.  For  example,  lovastatin,
an  inhibitor  of  cholesterol  synthesis
(HMG-Co  A  reductase),  slows  barrier
recovery,30 and induces a defect in barrier
function  when  applied  topically.31 Also,
feeding  mice  with  essential  fatty  acid
deficiency (EFAD) a diet lacking in linoleic
acid leads to barrier disruption, likely by
lowering  ceramide  levels.32 Therefore,  it
is clear that essential fatty acids and cho-
lesterol  play  an  integral  role  in  dry  skin
conditions. It is currently believed that no
single  lipid  alone  mediates  barrier  func-
tion, and that normal levels of ceramides,
cholesterol, and fatty acids, in the correct
ratio,  are  necessary  to  achieve  an  intact
barrier. Studies support this notion.33 Man
et al. showed that after altering the barrier

with acetone, reapplication of ceramides,
and fatty acids alone, or a combination of
ceramides and fatty acids, further delayed
barrier recovery. Only the application of a
combination  of  all  three  components,
ceramides,  fatty  acids,  and  cholesterol,
resulted in normal barrier recovery.

OTHER COMPONENTS THAT PLAY
A ROLE IN DRY SKIN

Natural Moisturizing Factor

SC hydration is highly regulated by the
natural  moisturizing  factor  (NMF),  a
mixture  of  low  molecular  weight-  and
water-soluble  by-products  of  filaggrin.
Corneocytes  are  anucleated  with  no
lipid content. They are composed of ker-
atin filaments and filaggrin and encased
by  a  cornified  cell  envelope.  Filaggrin,

also known as filament aggregating pro-
tein, plays an interesting role in epider-
mal  barrier  function  and  hydration.  In
lower levels of the skin, filaggrin plays a
structural  role;  however,  higher  up  in
the  skin,  it  is  broken  down  into  amino
acids that are hygroscopic and strongly
bind  water.  Histidine,  glutamine,  and
arginine  are  metabolites  of  filaggrin  in
the  SC.  Following  deamination  of  the
mentioned  three  amino  acids  to  trans-
urocanic  acid,  pyrrolidone  carboxylic
acid,  and  citrulline,  respectively,  an
osmotically active compound that regu-
lates skin hydration, known as  NMF, is
produced10,34 (Fig. 11-6A and B).

As  previously  mentioned,  trans-uro-
canic  acid,  pyrrolidone  carboxylic  acid,
and citrulline, all derived from filaggrin,
generate  an  inward  gradient  of  water
into the SC. Other components of NMF
are lactic acid and urea, also functioning

as  sodium,  potassium,  calcium,  and

components results in a decrease in the

in  skin  hydration.
tance  of  NMF 
Interestingly, NMF components undergo
seasonal  changes.  While  amino  acid
components  of  NMF  have  been  shown
to  increase  during  winter,  lactic  acid,
potassium,  sodium,  and  chloride  were
significantly  lower  compared  to  their
levels  in  summer.36 Although  there  are
many  products  on  the  market  simulat-
ing  the  NMF,  formulating  a  product
identical  to  it  has  been  a  challenge  to
researchers. This may be because of the
natural adaptation of the NMF to differ-
ent environments, in every person.

AQUAPORINS AND THE 
EPIDERMIS

Peter  Agre 

Water is well known to permeate through
the lipid bilayers of epidermal skin. Until
recently,  simple  diffusion  was  the  only
presumed mechanism for water conduc-
tion  through  epidermis.  Aquaporins
(AQPs), which are a form of water chan-
nel,  are  integral  membrane  proteins  that
facilitate  water  transport  in  various
organs  such  as  skin,  renal  tubules,  eyes,
the digestive tract, and even the brain. In
2003, 
and  Roderick
MacKinnon  received  the  Nobel  Prize  in
chemistry for discovering aquaporins and
for their structural studies of ion channels,
respectively.  There  are  13  isoforms  of
aquaporins found in mammals, classified
as AQP 0 to 12. In the cell membrane they
are arranged as homotetramers. Each sub-
unit of the tetramer consists of six (cid:2) heli-
cal domains and contains a distinct aque-
ous pore (Fig. 11-7). Functionally, they can
be classified into two subtypes: AQPs 1,
2, 4, 5, and 8, which only transport water,
and AQPs 3, 7, 9, and 10, which are able
to conduct other substances such as glyc-
erol or urea in addition to water.43 AQP-3
is the predominant water channel found
in human epidermis, and is permeable to
both  water  and  glycerin.  Glycerin  has
been 
implicated  as  an  endogenous
humectant  contributing  to  SC  hydra-
tion.44 Studies have shown that defects in
AQP-3 in mice models result in epidermal
dryness,  as  well  as  decreased  SC  hydra-
tion  and  glycerol  content  of  the  epider-
mis, followed by decreased elasticity and
impaired skin barrier recovery.45,46 These
studies have accentuated the importance
of glycerol in skin hydration. Aquaporin is
thought  to  facilitate  transport  of  water,
glycerol,  and  solutes  between  ker-
atinocytes.

corneum defensive functions: an integrated view. J Invest Dermatol. 2005;125(2):183-200.)

SEBUM

Sebum-derived  lipids  may  also  play  a
part in dry skin pathophysiology by pre-
venting water loss through forming lipid
films  on  the  skin’s  surface  that  function
as  an  emollient.  However,  low  levels  of
sebaceous  gland  activity  have  not  been
consistently  correlated  with  the  occur-
rence  of  dry  skin  and  the  impact  of
sebum  on  dry  skin  conditions  is  poorly
understood.20 Choi  et  al.  compared
sebum production and SC hydration and
found that even though males had sebum
secretion levels 30% to 40% higher than
women, the males did not show greater
SC  hydration  on  the  sebaceous  gland
enriched forehead sites than did females.

They also showed that prepubertal chil-
dren  whose  sebaceous  glands  have  not
reached maximal function demonstrated
normal levels of SC hydration. They did,
however, find a correlation with glycerol
levels  and  SC  hydration  that  can  help
explain the role of the sebaceous glands
in dry skin. The sebaceous glands utilize
large amounts of triglycerides, leading to
the  production  of  glycerol.  Supplying
glycerol  for  skin  hydration  may  be  an
important  role  for  sebaceous  glands.44
This theory is supported by the fact that
mice with hypoplastic sebaceous glands
have poor SC hydration and low SC glyc-
erol levels.47 However, glycerol can come
from  sources  other  than  the  sebaceous
glands, which would explain the normal

SC  hydration  in  prepubertal  children.
Glycerol  can  be  transported  from  the
circulation  into  the  basal  cells  via  the 
AQP-3 channels.45 The importance of glyc-
erol is highlighted by the fact that topical
glycerol restores hydration to asepia mice
while topical sebaceous lipids do not.47

ANATOMICAL VARIATION IN 
WATER LOSS

Various  body  parts  are  known  to  regu-
late water loss differently. For example,
the soles and palms regulate water loss
poorly,  while  facial  skin  is  relatively
water impermeable. While the functions
of the SC lipids are not fully understood,
evidence supports the notion that lipids
play  a  critical  role  in  skin  permeability.
One  study 
found  no  relationship
between barrier function and the thick-
ness or the number of cell layers in the
SC.48 However,  an  inverse  relationship
was  discovered  between  lipid  weight
percent  and  permeability.  Researchers
found that the lipid weight percent was
higher  in  the  face  (less  permeable)  and
lower  in  the  plantar  SC  (more  perme-
able).  Another  study  was  conducted  to
identify  the  components  of  this  “lipid
weight percent” and how they vary site
to site.49 Investigators compared charac-
teristics  from  the  abdomen,  leg,  face,
and sole, and found that the areas with
superior  barrier  properties  contained  a
higher  percent  of  neutral  lipids  and
lower amount of sphingolipids. In other
words, the neutral lipid to sphingolipid
ratio  was  proportional  to  the  known
permeability  of  each  site.  Interestingly,
the  plantar  surface,  known  to  be  the
most  permeable,  contained  the  highest
amounts of sphingolipids.

ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES AND 
THE EPIDERMAL BARRIER

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are com-
ponents of the innate immune system of
the skin. They exhibit a broad spectrum
of  antimicrobial  activity  against  bacte-
ria,  viruses,  and  fungi.  Defensins  and
cathelecidins  are  two  major  groups  of
AMPs.  Defensins  are  cysteine-rich
cationic  AMPs  present  in  mammalians
that are categorized into two subgroups:
(cid:2)-defensins 
and  (cid:3)-defensins.  (cid:2)-
defensins  are  mostly  found  in  neu-
trophils50,51 and  panteh  cells  of  small
intestines.52 (cid:3)-defensins,  on  the  other
hand,  are  present  in  the  epidermis,53,54
and  possess  antimicrobial  activity
against gram-positive and -negative bac-
teria, Candida albicans, and fungi.54–58

BOX 11-3 How the Skin Responds to
Changes in the Environment

The skin is able to adjust to changes in
humidity. This process takes several days, so
skin may be dry and inﬂamed during the ﬁrst
few days of exposure to decreased humidity,
but several mechanisms seem to allow skin
to adjust to these environmental changes.
Epidermal permeability function is increased
in a low-humidity environment.70

It has been found that changes in hydra-

tion status signal several downstream
responses, including epidermal DNA synthe-
sis and catabolism of ﬁlaggrin into deimi-
nated carboxylic acid metabolites.71,72 NMF
production is increased in low-humidity envi-
ronments as well.73,74

decreased  production  and  secretion  of
lamellar  bodies.  “Stress  hormones”  are
glucocorticoids produced in response to
stress. It follows then that stress would
lead  to  barrier  disruption  by  increasing
glucocorticoid levels. Choi et al. showed
that psychologic stress led to a decrease
of lipid synthesis as well as disruption of
lamellar  body  formation,  and  was  cor-
rected  by  applications  of  exogenous
physiologic lipids69 (Box 11-3).

HOW THE EPIDERMIS 
RESPONDS TO EPIDERMAL
BARRIER INSULT

Acute disruption of the epidermal barrier
initiates  a  homeostatic  repair  response
that results in the rapid recovery of per-
meability  barrier  function.75 This  repair
mechanism  is  inhibited  if  the  skin  is
covered  with  an  occlusive  dressing.
Grubauer et al. showed that TEWL trig-
gers lipid synthesis resulting in a repaired
skin  barrier.  As  TEWL  decreases,  lipid
synthesis returns to normal levels.76 Once
triggered,  this  repair  response  begins
within minutes with the rapid secretion
of  the  contents  of  the  lamellar  bodies
from the outer stratum granulosum cells.
A marked decrease (50%–80%) of preex-
isting lamellar bodies is seen in the stra-
tum granulosum cells initially but is soon
followed by newly formed lamellar bod-
ies. Accelerated lipid synthesis and lamel-
lar body secretion continues until perme-
ability  barrier  function  returns  toward
normal.77

A  calcium  gradient  seems  to  play  a
role in triggering the lamellar body secre-
tion. High levels of extracellular calcium
are  found  in  the  upper  epidermis  sur-
rounding the stratum granulosum cells.78

motifs in loops B and E are juxtaposed, they form a single aqueous channel spanning the bilayer (the
“hour-glass”)  flanked  by  the  mercury-sensitive  residue  (C189). (Redrawn  with  permission  from

Cathelecidins  are  another  family  of
AMPs  containing  a  C-terminal  cationic
segment  with  antimicrobial  activity.59
There  is  only  one  member  of  the  cath-
elecidin  family  identified  in  humans,
known as LL-37, which has been shown
to  be  especially  important  against  viral
skin infections.60 LL-37 has been demon-
strated  to  increase  in  the  keratinocytes
of  inflamed  skin  such  as  psoriasis  and
nickel  allergy.61,62 Patients  with  atopic
dermatitis  have  been  reported  to  have
lower  levels  of  LL-37  and  human  (cid:3)-
defensin  2  peptide  in  their  epidermis,63
which  may  explain  their  vulnerability
toward  viral,  including  herpetic,60 and
staphylococcal infections.

DRY SKIN AND INFLAMMATION

Disruption  of  skin  barrier  function
stimulates the production of epidermal
cytokines,64 especially  interleukin  (IL)-
1(cid:2).65 This is amplified in low-humidity
conditions,  which  may  help  explain
why exacerbations of atopic dermatitis,
skin  itching,  hyperproliferation,  and
inflammation are seen in winter and in
low-humidity  environments.66 IL-1(cid:2)
has  been  shown  to  be  preformed,
stored, and released immediately when
the barrier is disturbed.67 Once IL-1(cid:2) is

expressed,  it  may  also  induce  other
cytokines  or  proinflammatory  mole-
cules  such  as  IL-6,  IL-8,  granulocyte/
macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor,
and  intercellular  adhesion  molecule-1.
Ashida  et  al.  showed  that  exposure  to
low  humidity  increased  epidermal  IL-
1(cid:2) synthesis  and  stimulated  IL-1(cid:2)
release  from  the  preformed  pool  in 
the  epidermis  after  tape  stripping.
Interestingly, the increase of IL-1(cid:2) seen
in low humidity only lasted for 4 days
after which the skin was able to adapt
to  the  low-humidity  environment  by
unknown mechanisms.

STRESS AND THE SKIN 
BARRIER

Psychologic stress has long been known
to  be  associated  with  skin  conditions,
such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and
seborrheic dermatitis. Immune and neu-
roendocrine  mechanisms  likely  play  a
role  in  these  diseases,  but  studies  have
also  shown  that  barrier  disruption
occurs during stress, leading to the exac-
erbation of dry skin and other skin con-
ditions. Studies have also demonstrated
that glucocorticoids lead to disruption of
the  skin  barrier.68 Glucocorticoids
in
inhibit 

lipid  synthesis  resulting 

 
 
 
Immediately after barrier disruption, the
increased  water  movement  through  the
compromised  SC  carries  calcium  out-
ward toward the skin surface. This leads
to  a  reduction  in  calcium  concentration
around  the  stratum  granulosum  cells,
which triggers lamellar body secretion.79
It  is  postulated  that  skin  calmodulin-
related factor (SCARF) acts as a Ca2+ sen-
sor, by binding target proteins and lead-
ing to barrier repair.80 The important role
of  calcium  flux  is  demonstrated  when
exogenous  calcium  is  supplied  to  a  dis-
turbed  barrier,  lamellar  body  secretion
does not occur, and permeability barrier
repair  is  not  initiated.81 If  the  calcium
surrounding  the  stratum  granulosum
cells is decreased experimentally by ion-
tophoresis or sonophoresis, secretion of
lamellar bodies is stimulated even if the
barrier is undisturbed.82

Other  factors  likely  play  a  role  in
lamellar  body  secretion  as  well.
Keratinocytes  are  able  to  produce  large
amounts of cytokines and a store of IL-
1(cid:2) and IL-1(cid:3) is kept available in the ker-
atinocyte.  In  response  to  acute  barrier
disruption,  IL-1(cid:2) is  released83 and  an
increase in the expression of TNF, IL-1,
and IL-6 on messenger RNA and protein
levels is seen.67,64 Mice deficient in IL-1,
IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-(cid:2) signal-
ing exhibit a delay in permeability bar-
rier repair after acute barrier disruption,
a  role  for  these  cytokines  in  regulating
permeability barrier homeostasis.84

Each  of  these  factors  is  thought  to
play an important role in barrier repair,
and  topical  therapies  using  cytokines,
growth factors, and calcium modulators
are being studied.

TREATMENT

The  symptoms  of  dry  skin  can  be
treated by increasing the hydration state
of  the  SC  with  occlusive  or  humectant
ingredients and by smoothing the rough
surface with an emollient. Moisturizers
are products designed to increase hydra-
tion  of  the  skin.  They  often  contain
lipids such as ceramides, fatty acids, and
cholesterol.  In  addition,  glycerin  is  a
common  component.  The  commonly
used moisturizers are oil-in-water emul-
sions,  such  as  creams  and  lotions,  and
water-in-oil  emulsions  such  as  hand
creams.  For  more  information  on  the
range  of  topical  dry  skin  treatment
options, see Chapter 32.

Supplements, Diet, and Dry Skin

Lipids comprise only approximately 10%
of  the  total  weight  of  the  SC,  but  their

role in constructing a watertight barrier is
crucial for survival. The epidermis is the
main site of sterol and fatty acid synthesis
and  most  lipids  found  in  the  epidermal
barrier  are  produced  in  the  epidermis
itself and not derived by diet. In fact, lipid
synthesis occurs independently of serum
sterol  levels  and  amount  of  dietary  cho-
lesterol.76 Linoleic acid is a very important
essential fatty acid that must be supplied
through  diet  or  topical  application
because it is not made in the epidermis. It
is a component of phospholipids, gluco-
sylceramides,  and  Ceramides  1,  4,  and
9.85 In  essential  fatty  acid  deficiency,
when  linoleate  is  not  present,  it  is
replaced  with  oleate,  which  results  in
marked  abnormalities  in  cutaneous  per-
meability  barrier  function.86,87 These
observations  indicate  that  essential  fatty
acids are required for the normal structure
and  permeability  barrier  function  of  the
SC. (cid:2)-linoleic acid is an (cid:14)-3 fatty acid and
is  found  in  salmon  and  fish  oils  such  as
cod  liver  oil.  Although  no  skin  changes
have been associated with a deficiency of
(cid:14)-3 fatty acids, it is widely believed that
they play an important role in regulating
inflammation.

SUMMARY

Patients  usually  present  with  primary
complaints other than dry skin, but often
add, incidentally, that their skin feels dry.
Mild dry skin is a condition that affects
many patients plenty of whom try OTC
products before seeking medical advice.
Once the complaint of dry skin reaches
the dermatologist, it is best that the prac-
titioner  be  able  to  knowledgeably  dis-
cuss  the  implications  of  “dry  skin”  and
the  spectrum  of  effective  treatment
options,  and  match  such  products  to  a
patient’s skin conditions.

Sensitive Skin

Leslie Baumann, MD

Sensitive skin is a condition characterized
by hyperreactivity to environmental fac-
tors. Individuals experiencing this condi-
tion report exaggerated reactions to topi-
cal  personal  care  products  that  may  or
may not be associated with visible symp-
toms.  Approximately  50%  of  patients
with sensitive skin manifest their uncom-

inflammation.1
ing  visible  signs  of 
Sensitive  skin  can  be  very  distressing  to
those  who  have  it.  Affected  individuals
often have to travel with their own skin
care products because they cannot use the
skin  care  products  provided  in  a  hotel.
These  patients  are  the  ones  who  should
not  experiment  with  skin  care products,
but should find what works for them and
stick with it. Cosmetic companies realize
the  importance  of  avoiding  marketing
products with ingredients that aggravate
sensitive  skin.  Most  of  the  larger  well-
known companies conduct skin sensitiv-
ity  testing  of  their  products  prior  to
launch; however, occasionally, a product
will  sneak  through  undetected  that
causes symptoms in sensitive skin types.
This is a significant problem for compa-
nies when it occurs because 78% of con-
sumers who have sensitive skin state that
they have avoided a particular product or
brand  because  of  past  skin  reactions.2
Those with frequent skin reactions learn
to limit their use of skin products to the
few that do not cause irritation in order
to  avoid  the  annoyance  of  redness  and
itching  that  can  interfere  with  everyday
activities. Those with frequent skin reac-
tions  report  a  decrease  in  quality  of  life
and  frustration  is  a  common  complaint.
In a French study of more than 2000 indi-
viduals, it was found that those with sen-
sitive  skin  reported  a  poorer  quality  of
life compared to those without sensitive
skin  using  the  SF-12  questionnaire.3
However, depressive symptoms were no
more  common  in  those  with  sensitive
skin as compared to those with “normal”
skin.

PREVALENCE

Epidemiologic  surveys  show  a  high
prevalence of sensitive skin. In a phone

survey of 800 ethnically diverse women
in the US, 52% described having sensi-
tive skin.2 In a UK mail survey of 2058
people, 51.5% of the women and 38.2%
of  the  men  reported  having  sensitive
skin.4 Sensitive  skin  is  most  commonly
reported  on  the  face.  However,  one
study showed that 85% of the 400 sub-
jects  evaluated  described  sensitive  skin
on  the  face,  while  70%  reported  sensi-
tive  skin  in  other  areas:  hands  (58%),
scalp  (36%),  feet  (34%),  neck  (27%),
torso (23%), and back (21%).5

TYPES OF SENSITIVE SKIN

In 

Sensitive skin has been difficult to char-
acterize  in  the  past  because  it  is  often
self-perceived,  is  not  accompanied  by
visible  skin  changes,  and  testing  can
show 
the
inconsistent  results. 
attempt  to  characterize  sensitive  skin,
several classification systems have been
described.  Yokota  et  al.  classified  sensi-
tive skin into three different types based
on their physiologic parameters.6 Type 1
was defined as the low-barrier function
group. Type 2 was defined as the inflam-
mation group with normal barrier func-
tion  and  inflammatory  changes.  Type  3
was  termed  the  “pseudohealthy  group”
in  terms  of  normal  barrier  function  and
no  inflammatory  changes.  In  all  of  the
Yokota  sensitive  skin  types,  a  higher
content  of  nerve  growth  factor  was
observed in the stratum corneum (SC). In
both  types  2  and  3,  the  sensitivity  to
electrical  stimuli  was  high.  These  data
suggest  that  the  hypersensitive  reaction
seen  in  these  types  is  closely  related  to
nerve fibers innervating the epidermis.

Pons-Guiraud  divided  sensitive  skin
into  three  subgroups.7 “Very  sensitive
skin” was described as reactive to a wide
variety of both endogenous and exoge-
nous  factors.  This  type  was  associated
with both acute and chronic symptoms
and  a  strong  psychologic  component.
The  second  type  was  called  “environ-
mentally sensitive” and was described as
clear,  dry,  thin  skin  with  a  tendency  to
blush  or  flush  in  reaction  to  environ-
mental  factors.  The  final  group  was
“cosmetically sensitive skin,” which was
transiently reactive to specific and defin-
able cosmetic products.

Muizzuddin  and  others  from  the
Estée  Lauder  companies  defined  three
sensitive  skin  subgroups  as  well.88 The
first  subgroup  was  called  “delicate
skin,” distinguished by easily disrupted

barrier  function  not  accompanied  by  a
rapid or intense inflammatory response.
The  second  subgroup  was  “reactive
skin,” characterized by a strong inflam-
matory  response  without  a  significant
increase  in  transepidermal  water  loss.
The 
third  group  was  known  as
“stingers” (a term coined by Kligman in
1977), which was described as a height-
ened neurosensory perception to minor
cutaneous stimulation.

The Baumann Skin Typing System is
determined  by  historical  data  gathered
in a questionnaire form.9 It divides sensi-
tive skin into four types based on diag-
nosis (Table 12-1). Type 1 sensitive skin
is prone to developing open and closed
comedones  and  pimples  and  is  known
as the acne type or S1 type. Type 2 sen-
sitive  skin  is  characterized  by  facial
flushing  because  of  heat,  spicy  food,
emotion,  or  vasodilation  of  any  cause
and  is  known  as  the  flushing  rosacea
type or as the S2 type. Type 3 sensitive
skin,  or  the  S3  type,  is  characterized  by
burning, itching, or stinging of any cause.
Type  4  sensitive  skin  is  the  phenotype
that is susceptible to develop contact der-
matitis  and  irritant  dermatitis.  The  S4
type is often associated with an impaired
skin  barrier  (see  Chapters  15–18).  An
individual may suffer from combinations
of the sensitive skin subtypes. For exam-
ple,  a  person  may  burn  and  sting  and
develop acne from certain skin care prod-
ucts.  In  this  case,  they  would  be  desig-
nated as an S1S3 sensitive skin type.

Acne

Baumann S1 sensitive skin is character-
ized  by  acne  breakouts  manifesting  as
open  or  closed  comedones  as  well  as
papules and pustules (Figs. 12-1 and 12-2).
This subtype was termed “acne cosmet-
ica”  by  Kligman  and  Mills  in  1972.10
Ingredients  in  skin  care  and  hair  care
products  such  as  coconut  oil  and  iso-
propyl  myristate  may  contribute  to
acne.  Blushes,  lipstick,  and  other  color

Cosmetic)  red  dyes,  which  are  coal

ing  unless  the  subject  also  suffers  from
Baumann  S2  sensitive  skin  with  a  ten-
dency to flush (see Chapter 17).

Contact Dermatitis and 
Irritant Dermatitis

Baumann S4 sensitive skin is exhibited by
individuals  who  have  a  history  of  fre-
quent scaling, redness or irritation to aller-
gens and irritants. Atopic dermatitis suf-
ferers  would  fall  into  this  category.
These  patients  are  more  susceptible  to
react  to  substances  that  are  not  com-
monly considered irritants, likely caused
by an impaired barrier. These substances
include many cosmetics ingredients such
as: dimethyl sulfoxide, benzoyl peroxide
preparations, salicylic acid, propylene gly-
col,  amyldimethylaminobenzoic  acid,
and  2-ethoxyethyl  methoxycinnamate.
The  current  theory  is  that  an  impaired
skin barrier allows the entrance of chemi-
cals  into  the  skin,  leading  to  vasodilata-
tion,  itching,  scaling,  and  other  symp-
toms.  Many  studies  have  supported  the
idea that an impaired barrier predisposes
an individual to develop this type of sen-
sitive  skin.  One  elegant  study  used
methyl  nicotinale  (MN),  a  water-soluble
compound  widely  used  to  investigate
transcutaneous  penetration.  Topical
application  of  MN  in  humans  induces
vasodilatation because of the action of the
drug on smooth muscle cells.15 This study
demonstrated that lactic acid stingers and
those  that  showed  susceptibility  to  SLS
patch-testing  irritation  were  more  likely
to develop vasodilatation when MN was

suffer from facial flushing that may be a

Burning and Stinging

Baumann S3 sensitive skin is character-
ized by burning and stinging upon appli-
cation of skin care products or exposure
to  environmental  factors  such  as  wind,
cold, or heat. These subjective signs are

on the rabbit ear model, it appeared that
many  ingredients  used  in  cosmetics
evoked a comedogenic response in ani-
mals. As animal testing fell into disfavor,
new methods of comedogenicity testing
were  developed.  Subsequently,  Mills
and  Kligman  published  a  study  explor-
ing  the  effects  of  these  chemicals  in
human beings and found that the results
were dissimilar from those observed in
the  rabbit  ear  model.32 Human  models
of comedogenicity are currently used.13

Baumann S2 Type Skin

Vasoreactive  tests  examine  vasodilata-
tion of the skin to ascertain susceptibility
to  flush.  The  most  popular  test  uses
methyl  nicotinate,  a  potent  vasodilator.
MN  is  applied  to  the  upper  third  of  the
ventral forearm in concentrations varying
between 1.4% and 13.7% for a period of
15  seconds.  The  vasodilatory  effect  is
assessed  by  observing  the  induced  ery-
thema  and  measuring  it  with  various
devices  such  as  a  spectrometer  or  laser
Doppler velocimeter (LDV). Another test
used to measure the propensity for facial
flushing is the red wine provocation test;
however,  this  test  is  not  very  specific.
Susceptible  patients  report  a  sense  of
warmth  beginning  around  the  head  or
neck  area  and  moving  upward  on  the
face  10  to  15  minutes  after  ingestion  of
six  ounces  of  red  wine.  Within  30  min-
utes,  flushing  becomes  clinically  evi-
dent.33 The  disadvantage  of  this  test,
though, is that it lacks specificity for S2
sensitive  skin  types;  it  may  be  positive
when  other  conditions,  such  as  alcohol
dehydrogenase syndrome, are present.

Baumann S3 Type Skin

The  sensory  reactivity  test  focuses  on
the  neurosensory  component  of  the 
sensitive skin response. The most popu-
lar has been the sting test,34 in which lac-
tic  acid  or  other  agents  including  cap-
saicin,  ethanol,  menthol,35 sorbic  acid,
and  benzoic  acid36 are  applied  to  the
skin (see Chapters 17 and 38).

Baumann S4 Type Skin

To  test  for  this  type  of  skin,  an  irritant
reactivity test is performed. This is also
called a “patch test.” In this test, an irri-
tant or allergen is applied to the skin for
a certain amount of time, usually 48 to
72 hours, and objective measures of irri-
tation such as erythema and scaling are
gauged. Primary irritants such as SLS or
suspected allergens may be applied (see
Chapter 18).

SEASONALITY AND GENDER 
EFFECTS ON SENSITIVE SKIN

“Sensitive  skin”  of  the  burning,  stinging,
and  itching  type  was  found  to  be  more
frequent  during  the  summer  than  the
winter in one study.3 In this same study,
women  were  found  to  be  more  likely
than men to have sensitive skin. This may
reflect the fact that women have a much
higher  exposure,  in  terms  of  frequency
and  variety,  to  personal  care  products
than do men. The thickness of the epider-
mis was observed to be greater in males
than  in  females,  which  may  mean  that
men  have  a  stronger  barrier  to  entry  of
irritants and allergens.16 Hormonal differ-
ences  may  produce  increased  inflamma-
tory sensitivity in females.17

ETHNICITY AND SENSITIVE 
SKIN

Studies suggest that blacks are less reac-
tive  and  Asians  are  more  reactive  than
whites,  but  no  studies  are  conclu-
sive.18,19 A French study based on ques-
tionnaires  showed  that  a  fair  skin  type
was  more  commonly  associated  with
sensitive  or  very  sensitive  skin.3 An
American study, by Jourdain et al., used
telephone surveys of approximately 200

each  of  African  Americans,  Asians,
European Americans, and Hispanics and
did not find any differences in the preva-
lence  of  sensitive  skin  among  ethnic
groups.2 In  a  German–Japanese  study,
Japanese  women  reported  subjective
feelings  of  skin  irritation  more  fre-
quently  than  German  women.  This
study  demonstrated 
Japanese
women  report  skin  stinging  of  greater
severity than Caucasian women do.20

that 

A  normal  SC,  as  measured  in  Cau-
casians,  has  been  reported  to  consist 
of  around  15  cell  layers.21,22 The  SC
appears  to  be  equally  thick  in  black 
and  white  skin.23,24 However,  African
Americans  have  been  shown  to  have  a
higher lipid content in the SC, more SC
cell layers, and required more tape strips
to  remove  the  SC  as  compared  to
Caucasians.25,26 This  was  purported  to
be  the  reason  that  several  studies  have
reported  decreased  erythema  in  blacks
after  topical  application  of  known  irri-
tants.27–29 Large-scale  global  studies
looking at the ethnic differences in inci-
dence  of  the  various  types  of  sensitive
skin  have  not  been  performed.  At  this
time, the precise role of ethnicity in skin
sensitivity remains to be elucidated.

TESTING FOR SENSITIVE SKIN

to  test  cosmetic  ingredients  for  their

SUMMARY

Sensitive  skin  is  a  very  common  com-
plaint globally. It has several presentations
that  have  led  to  different  classification
systems.  The  Baumann  Skin  Typing
System divides those with sensitive skin
into four unique subtypes, which are dis-
cussed at length in other chapters. Using
this system can help provide insights into
the causes of these various subgroups of
sensitive  skin,  including  the  potential
roles of gender and ethnicity pertaining to
subtype, and should help lead to advances
in the treatment of these subtypes.

Skin Pigmentation
and Pigmentation
Disorders

Leslie Baumann, MD
Sogol Saghari, MD

Pigmentation disorders and tanning play
a significant role in skin appearance and
the  sense  of  well  being.  Many  people
feel  that  they  look  better  with  tanned
skin,  even  though  achieving  such  an
appearance  may  be  contributing  in  the
long  term  to  the  formation  of  pigment
disorders.  In  some  cultures,  such  as  in
Asia,  pigmentation  concerns  outweigh
worries about developing wrinkles. Like
acne,  disorders  of  pigmentation  cause
significant stress and embarrassment, so
the treatment options should be under-
stood  by  every  cosmetic  physician.  In
this chapter, the mechanisms known to
be  involved  in  pigment  formation  will
be explained and the pigmentary condi-
tions  most  likely  to  be  seen  by  a  cos-
metic  dermatologist  will  be  discussed.
There  is  a  wide  array  of  rare  dyschro-
mias that are more pathologic in nature
and  that  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this
chapter.  Cosmetic  dermatologists  are
often  faced  with  patients  presenting
with  melasma,  solar  lentigos,  postin-
flammatory hyperpigmentation, and cir-
cles under the eyes. This group of condi-
tions will be focused on here, in addition
to some treatment options. Depigment-
ing  agents  will  be  discussed  in  greater
detail in Chapter 33.

SKIN COLOR

Skin color results from the incorporation
of the melanin-containing melanosomes,
produced  by  the  melanocytes,  into  the
keratinocytes in the epidermis and their
ensuing  degradation.  Although  other
factors contribute to skin color, such as
carotenoids  or  hemoglobin,1
the
amount,  quality,  and  distribution  of
melanin present in the epidermis is the
main source responsible for human skin
color.  The  number  of  melanocytes  in
human skin is equal in all races, thereby
rendering melanocyte activity and inter-
action  with  the  keratinocytes  as  the
accountable  factors  for  skin  color.2 In
darker-pigmented  individuals,  melano-

cytes  produce  more  melanin; 
the
melanosomes are larger and more heav-
ily melanized, and they undergo degra-
dation  at  a  slower  rate  than  in  lighter-
skinned  individuals.3 Skin  of  color  will
be further discussed in Chapter 14.

Production of Melanin

of 

Melanin  pigment  is  produced  in  the
melanosome, an organelle located in the
cytoplasm 
the  melanocytes.
Melanosomes  in  human  skin  undergo
four stages of development while inside
the  melanocyte.  In  stage  I,  premelan-
somes are characterized by their spheri-
cal  structure  and  amorphous  matrix.
During stage II, they become more oval
shaped  with  no  apparent  melanin.  In
stage  III,  following  tyrosinase  activity,
melanin  production  starts  and  the
melanization  continues  to  stage  IV, 
at  which  point  the  organelle  contains
high  concentrations  of  melanin.  The
melanosomes are then transferred along
microtubules to the dendritic structures
of  melanocytes  and  transferred  to  the
keratinocytes.

The process of melanin production in
the  melanosomes  is  conducted  via  a
pathway that begins with the hydroxy-
lation  of  tyrosine  to  3,4-dihydroxy-
phenylalanine (DOPA) using the enzyme
tyrosinase, which subsequently oxidizes
DOPA  to  dopaquinone,  leading  to  the
formation  of  melanin4 (Fig.  13-1).  Two
types  of  melanin  are  produced:  eume-
lanin  and  pheomelanin.  The  relative
amounts  of  these  two  types  determine
hair  color  and  skin  tone.  Individuals
with  darker  skin  tones  have  mostly
eumelanin  and  a  lesser  amount  of
pheomelanin,  while  the  opposite  is 
true  in  people  with  a  light  skin  color.
Based  on  the  levels  of  cysteine  and
sulfhydryl  components  such  as  glu-
tathione,  dopaquinone  may  be  con-
verted  to  cysteinyl-Dopa,  giving  rise  to
pheomelanin  or  DOPA  chrome,  which
leads to eumelanin production.

Tyrosinase  is  the  rate-limiting  step
for  melanin  production.  Tyrosinase  is
stimulated  by  ultraviolet  (UV)  radia-
tion, by DNA fragments such as thymi-
dine dinucleotides that form as a result
of  UV  radiation,5 and  other  factors
such  as  melanocyte-stimulating  hor-
mone (MSH), as well as growth factors
such  as  bFGF  and  endothelin.  Protein
kinase  C6 and  the  cyclic  adenosine
monophosphate  (cAMP)  (cid:5) protein
kinase  A  pathway5 play  a  role  in

increasing  melanin  production  as  do
prostaglandins  D2,  E2,  and  F2,  tumor
necrosis  factor  (TNF)-(cid:2),  interleukins
1(cid:2), IL1(cid:3), and IL6.7 Vitamin D may also
play a role in stimulating melanogene-
sis.8

Once  the  melanin  is  synthesized
within  the  melanosomes,  it  migrates
into the dendrite tips of the melanocytes
via microtubules and using myosin V fil-
aments9 and  a  dynein  “motor.”10 Each
melanocyte is in contact with an average
of 36 keratinocytes, forming an “epider-
mal  melanin  unit”1,11 (Fig.  13-2).  The
melanin  in  the  melanocytes  is  then
incorporated into other keratinocytes of
the  epidermal  melanin  unit  or  into  the
dermis  by  a  process  that  is  still  poorly
understood.  Several  mechanisms  have
been  proposed  for  this  transfer  of
melanin to the neighboring keratinocytes.
The first involves phagocytosis. Melanin
is  released  into  the  dermis  following
damage  to  melanocytes  in  the  basal
layer  and  is  then  phagocytized  by
melanophages. Another proposed mech-
anism  of  melanin  transfer  is  endocyto-
sis.  This  process  would  involve  the
melanosomes  being  discharged  directly
into  the  intercellular  spaces  followed 
by  endocytosis  by  the  keratinocytes.
The  final  hypothesis 
is  that  the
melanin transfer occurs by keratinocyte-
fusion.12
melanocyte  membrane 
Although  the  exact  process  of  melanin
transfer  is  not  completely  understood,
new discoveries are rapidly being made
in  this  area.  For  example,  Sieberg  et  al.
found 
the  protease-activated
receptor  2  (PAR-2),  expressed  on  ker-
atinocytes, is important in regulating the
ingestion  of  melanosomes  by  ker-
atinocytes  in  culture.12 PAR-2  is  a  G-
protein-coupled  receptor  that  is  acti-
vated  by  a  serine  protease  cleavage,13
and  is  able  to  enhance  the  capacity  of
keratinocytes  to  ingest  melanosomes.
The PAR-2 can be up- or downregulated,
and is upregulated by UV radiation.14 It
is thought to be important in hyperpig-
mentation disorders because it has been
found  that  serine  protease  inhibitors
that  interfere  with  PAR-2  activation
induce  depigmentation  by  reducing
melanosome transfer and distribution.15
Soybeans,  which  contain  the  serine
protease  inhibitors  soybean  trypsin
inhibitor  (STI)  and  Bowman-Birk  pro-
tease  inhibitor  (BBI),  have  been  shown
to inhibit melanosome transfer, resulting
in an improvement of mottled facial pig-
mentation.16 In  addition,  activation  of

PAR-2 with trypsin and other synthetic

Other systems play a role in melano-
some transfer as well. For example, the
soluble  portion  of  the  N-terminal  of

(cid:3)-amyloid  precursor  protein  (APP),
called sAPP, is a newly detected epider-
mal growth factor that has been shown
to increase the release of melanin as well

growth  factor  (KGF/FGF7)  also  pro-
motes melanosome transfer by stimulat-
ing the phagocytic process.18 Several dif-
ferent 
factors  affect  melanosome
transfer  and  play  a  role  in  the  complex
pigmentation process.

hair19 (Fig. 13-3). This pathway is inter-
esting  for  several  reasons.  First,  MSH
has been found to be a factor in the tan-
ning  mechanism.  Individuals  with  red
hair have a defect in the MC1R and are
poor tanners.20 The role of MSH in tan-
ning  is  discussed  in  the  upcoming  sec-
tion  on  tanning.  Second,  MSH  plays  a
role  in  the  hyperpigmentation  seen  in
endocrine  disorders  such  as  pituitary
tumors  and  Cushing’s  syndrome.  In
addition,  adrenocorticotropic  hormone
(ACTH)  levels  increase  with  stress;
therefore, stress can lead to an increase
in MSH. In fact, one study demonstrated
increased tanning in stressed mice when
exposed to UVB. This enhanced tanning
response  was  inhibited  when  the  mice
were  treated  with  corticostatin,  an
ACTH inhibitor.21 MSH may contribute
to  the  exacerbation  of  melasma  and
other  pigmentary  disorders  in  stressed
patients, as well as in tanning.

MELANOCYTE-STIMULATING 
HORMONE AND PIGMENTATION

As discussed, many factors play a role in
the  formation  and  transfer  of  melanin;
however,  the  role  of  MSH  deserves  a
separate  discussion.  MSH  is  derived
from the proopiomelanocortin (POMC)
gene.  Among  the  three  forms  of  MSH
((cid:2), (cid:3), and (cid:13)), (cid:2)MSH is the most active
form in the human body. Melanocortin
1  receptor  (MC1R)  is  the  receptor  for

located  on 

MSH  commonly 
the
melanocytes.  The  binding  of  MSH  to
MC1R  leads  to  activation  of  adenylate
cyclase,  which  increases  cAMP  levels.
cAMP  stimulates  the  activity  of  tyrosi-
nase,  leading  to  production  of  eume-
lanin.  In  cases  in  which  MC1R  is
mutated  or  not  functioning  properly,
the pathway switches to production of
pheomelanin.  MC1R  mutation,  and
therefore a higher presence of pheome-
lanin,  is  seen  in  individuals  with  red

UV irradiation is a major source of envi-

explain  the  particular  skin  tone  for  an
individual that, out of necessity, address

enced  color  and  melanin  production  of

or  environmental  factors,  whereas
facultative  skin  color (FSC)  denotes  the
color  influenced  by  UV  light  and  hor-
mones.22 When  exposed  skin  is  sub-
jected  to  UV  light,  melanogenesis  or
“tanning” occurs, representing the skin’s
major  defense  against  further  UV  dam-
age. This darkening results when the UV
radiation  provides  a  positive  signal  to
the  exposed  epidermal  melanin  units.
Subsequent  to  UVA  exposure,  the  skin
develops an immediate pigmentary darken-
ing provoked  by  the  oxidation  of  the
existing  melanin.  This  effect  appears
within  a  few  minutes  of  exposure  to
UVA  and  lasts  for  approximately  6  to 
8 hours. Both UVB and UVA are involved
in the process of delayed tanning. It is seen
2  to  3  days  after  exposure  and  lasts  for
approximately  10  to  14  days.  In  this
process,  tyrosinase  enzyme  activity  and
the  number  of  melanocytes  that  are
actively  producing  melanin  increase.  In
addition,  melanosome  transfer  from  the
melanocytes  to  the  keratinocytes  is
enhanced.23 The  resulting  increase  in
melanin protects against further UV dam-
age  by  surrounding  the  cell  nucleus  and
absorbing UV photons and UV-generated
free  radicals  before  they  can  react  with
DNA  and  other  critical  cellular  compo-
nents.  Research  by  Gilchrest  et  al.  has
demonstrated that DNA damage or DNA

repair 
intermediates  can  stimulate
melanogenesis  in  the  absence  of  UV
light.24 In  fact,  small,  single-stranded
DNA fragments such as thymidine dinu-
cleotides (pTT) are able to stimulate tan-
ning  through  activation  of  p53.5,25 A
tumor suppressor and transcription fac-
tor,  p53  is  known  to  mediate  the
response  to  DNA  damage.  Once  DNA
damage  occurs,  p53  induces  cell-cycle
arrest  and  facilitates  DNA  repair  or,
when the DNA damage is irreparable, it
triggers  apoptosis.  A  link  between  tan-
ning  and  p53  has  been  found  that  may
explain  the  positive  sensations,  or
endorphins,  reported  by  tanners.26
When  p53  is  stimulated  by  UV,  tran-
scription of the POMC gene is activated.
This  results  in  production  of  both
MSH  (leading  to  pigmentation)  and  (cid:3)-
endorphin, which is in the opiate family.
These findings may lend credence to the
theory that some individuals develop an
addiction to tanning27 (Fig. 13-4).

Once  activated  by  adenylate  cyclase,
cAMP plays a role in the tanning process
as  well  by  mediating  the  effects  of
(cid:2)MSH.28 When  MC1R  is  activated  by
MSH,  adenylate  cyclase  is  stimulated  to
form  cAMP,  which  then  stimulates
melanogenesis,  melanocyte  differentia-
tion, and the transfer of melanosomes to
keratinocytes. Increasing activity of cAMP

may  lead  to  a  tanning  response.  This
theory is supported by a trial in mice.
In this study, a topical formulation con-
taining  forskolin,  a  root  extract  of
Plectranthus  barbatus (also  called Coleus
forskohlii ),  was  applied  to  MC1R-defi-
cient mice. Forskohlii activates adeny-
late  cyclase,  which  upregulates  cAMP.
In the mice, topical application induced
melanogenesis  and  production  of
eumelanin.  However,  this  effect  was
not  seen  in  swine,  likely  because  of
greater  skin  thickness  and  therefore  a
stronger  barrier  to  penetration.  The
tanning  seen  in  the  mice  occurred
without activation of MC1R and thus,
it did not require sun exposure.29 This
study  illustrates  the  importance  of
cAMP  and  may  provide  promise  or
insight into mechanisms for developing
a “protective tan.”

Although  tanned  skin  is  considered
beautiful  by  many,  stimulating  the  pig-
mentary system is not always desirable.
In  many  Asian  countries,  for  example,
tanning 
is  not  commonplace  and
untanned  skin  is  preferred.  In  addition,
development  of  pigmentary  disorders
such  as  melasma  and  solar  lentigos  is
undesirable.  Understanding  the  mecha-
nisms  of  the  pigmentary  system  will
help  increase  the  understanding  of  the
following pigmentary disorders.

(cid:2) FIGURE 13-4 UV radiation activates p53, which stimulates the POMC gene to transcribe alpha melanocyte-stimulating
hormone. (cid:2)MSH binds the MC1-R receptor located on the melanocytes, which triggers adenylate cyclase to produce cAMP.
Interestingly, when  POMC  transcription  is  stimulated,
cAMP  then  stimulates  tyrosinase  to  produce  melanin.
(cid:3)-endorphin production also increases, leading to the “tanning high” reported by sun seekers.

MELASMA

Melasma, also known as chloasma or the
“mask of pregnancy,” is a very common
condition  usually  seen  in  women  of
childbearing age (Fig. 13-5). It is a chronic
disorder  that  can  be  frustrating  to
patients and physicians alike because it is
very difficult to treat. Melasma presents
as irregularly shaped, but often distinctly
defined, blotches of light- to dark-brown
pigmentation. These patches are  usually
seen on the upper lip, nose, cheeks, chin,
forehead,  and,  sometimes,  the  neck.
There  are  three  typical  patterns  of 
distribution—most  common  is  centrofa-
cial, involving the cheeks, forehead, upper
lip,  nose,  and  chin.30 The  malar  pattern,
which  affects  the  nose  and  cheeks,  and
mandibular pattern, are less common. It is
most commonly seen in areas that receive
sun  exposure;  however,  melasma  has
been reported on the nipples and around
the external genitalia.31,32

Etiology

Melasma  is  a  fairly  typical,  physiologic
occurrence seen most often during preg-
nancy  or  oral  contraceptive  use.  It  can
occur  at  any  time  during  a  woman’s
reproductive years, and is more common
in women of darker skin types. Although
there  have  been  many  suggested  causa-
tive factors, estrogen and UV light seem
to  be  the  most  prominent  culprits.
Melasma  is  so  common  in  pregnancy
that  it  has  been  dubbed  the  “mask  of
pregnancy.” It is currently unknown how

increased estrogen levels lead to melasma;
however,  recent  studies  have  suggested
that estradiols may play an important role
in  the  etiology.  17  (cid:3)-Estradiol,  which  is
known to affect other cells of neural crest
origin,  has  been  shown  to  significantly
increase  the  activity  of  tyrosinase  when
added to melanocyte cultures.33 However,
melasma  also  occurs  in  men  in  approxi-
mately 10% of cases, most often in those
of  Middle  Eastern,  Caribbean,  or  Asian
descent. Solar exposure is well known to
exacerbate the condition and seems to be
necessary for its development.4,34 In fact,
melasma  has  been  reported  to  be  less
noticeable  in  the  winter  months  when
sun exposure is typically lower.4

The  other  proposed  causes  of
melasma include genetic predisposition,
nutritional  deficiency,  and  influence
from  hormones  such  as  progesterone,
although  the  exact  etiology  remains
vague.31,32 In  addition,  the  antiepilepsy
drugs Hydantoin and Dilantin have been
implicated in contributing to melasma in
both women and men.32,35 Approximately
one-third  of  cases  in  women  and  most
cases  in  men  are  idiopathic.32 Some
authors have hypothesized an endocrine,
causal mechanism,32 but no such mecha-
nism  has  been  established.35 Although
there  have  been  a  few  familial  cases
reported, the evidence that melasma can
be inherited is sparse.35 Heat may play a
role in melasma as well. Many women
develop melasma on the upper lip after
hot wax has been used as a hair removal
method. Although this may represent a
coincidence, it is so commonly reported

by patients that the author believes that
heat  may  play  a  role  in  melasma  as  it
does  in  erythema  ab  igne.  (Erythema 
ab  igne is  a  reticulated  erythematous
hyperpigmented  eruption  that  occurs
after chronic exposure to heat.)

Several  authors  have  noted  that
melasma  most  often  appears  in  young
women  who  are  using  oral  contracep-
tives.31,32 Melasma  is  also  common
among  pregnant  women  and  together
these two conditions comprise the major-
ity  of  melasma  cases.  Menopausal  and
premenstrual  presentations  occasionally
occur  as  well.  Although  estrogen  is
thought to play a major role in the eti-
ology  of  melasma,  there  is  also  a  low
incidence  of  melasma  cases  among
postmenopausal  women  on  estrogen
replacement therapy.4 Although melasma
may diminish in the months following a
patient’s  pregnancy  or  after  the  patient
discontinues oral contraceptives, the con-
dition often persists, taking up to 5 years
to resolve.32,35 The course of the condition
varies significantly from patient to patient
and within individual women, even from
pregnancy  to  pregnancy.4 Increased  inci-
dence  of  melasma  also  coincides  with
some  ovarian  disorders.  Unfortunately,
once  patients  develop  melasma,  they
have a high chance of experiencing recur-
rence of this difficult disorder.

It is always important to consider the
possibility of pigmented contact dermati-
tis (Riehl’s melanosis) in response to cos-
metic products when evaluating a patient
for  treatment  of  melasma,  since  avoid-
ance of the specific allergen will improve
the  clinical  picture  (see  Chapter  18 for
more  information  about  contact  der-
matitis).  As  mentioned  earlier,  stress
hormones such as ACTH and MSH are
involved  in  skin  pigmentation.  It  has
been previously shown that human ker-
atinocytes  are  capable  of  synthesizing
and  secreting  POMC-derived  peptides
such as ACTH and MSH.36 Inoue et al.
demonstrated  that  pretreatment  of
stressed mice, exposed to UV light, with
an  ACTH-inhibitor  reduced  the  num-
bers  of  dopa-positive  melanocytes.21
More  structural  studies  are  needed  to
evaluate the effect of stress in induction
or aggravation of melasma in humans.

Another  influence  in  melasma  is  the
stem cell factor, which is the ligand for
c-kit  located  on  the  melanocytes.  Stem
cell  factor  is  secreted  by  dermal  fibro-
blasts  and  keratinocytes.37 One  study
showed  that  there  is  increased  expres-
sion of stem cell factor in the dermis and
c-kit  of  lesional  skin  of  patients  with
melasma.38 The  authors  of  this  study
proposed  that  UV  light  activates  the

 
 
 
dermal  fibroblasts,  which 
leads  to
increased levels of soluble stem cell factor
and activation of epidermal melanocytes.
The role of stem cell factor in melasma is
poorly understood at this time.

melanosomes and dendritic processes in
the  hyperpigmented  area  of  the  skin.39
Dopa  reaction  has  shown  increased
melanin production within the increased
number of melanocytes.34

Histopathology

In  the  epidermal  form  of  melasma,
which  appears  light  or  dark  brown  or
black clinically, the basal and suprabasal
layers  have  a  higher  than  normal  level
of  melanin,  which  can  also  be  present
the  epidermis.31,4 The
throughout 
melanocytes  also  appear  larger  with
more  noticeable  dendritic  processes;
however, the number of melanocytes is
equal to the number in unaffected skin.39
In  the  dermal  type  of  melasma,  which
appears  blue-gray  clinically,  melanin-
laden macrophages emerge in a perivas-
cular arrangement in the superficial and
middle  level  of  the  dermis.  A  mixed
form,  with  both  epidermal  and  dermal
components, also commonly occurs.

Electron  microscopy  of  skin  from
patients with melasma shows increased

Epidermal Versus Dermal Disease

Epidermal  melasma  is  easier  to  treat
than  dermal  melasma  because  the
melanin  is  at  a  higher  level  in  the  skin
and  therefore  can  be  more  easily
reached  by  topically  applied  products.
Because  the  epidermal  component  is
amenable to treatment while the dermal
component is usually not, it is helpful to
determine the extent of the dermal com-
ponent of the condition in order to accu-
rately  predict  a  patient’s  treatment
response and to provide the patient with
the proper expectations. A Wood’s light
or blue light can be used to examine the
face  at  the  initial  visit  to  ascertain  the
extent  of  the  dermal  component34 (Fig.
13-6). In the epidermal type, the epider-
mal  component  will  appear  darker
under  Wood’s  light  examination.  The

(cid:2) FIGURE 13-6 Blue light can be used to visualize facial pigment.

dermal  component  will  be  less  visible
when observed under a Wood’s light.40 In
other words, if the lesions are more pro-
nounced with Wood’s light examination,
there  is  a  better  chance  for  clinical
improvement. However, the Wood’s light
examination  did  not  help  to  predict  the
clinical  response  to  peels  in  a  study  by
Lawrence.41 The  investigators  felt  that
this  occurred  because  there  was  such  a
high  number  of  patients  with  a  mixed
epidermal/dermal  form  of  melasma.
However,  the  consensus  remains  that
patients  in  whom  epidermal  melasma
predominates  may  respond  better  than
those  with  a  large  dermal  component.
Therefore, the Wood’s examination is still
a  useful  adjunct  to  determine  a  patient’s
prognosis in the treatment of melasma.

Treatment

The  therapeutic  objective  is  to  retard 
the proliferation of melanocytes, inhibit
the  formation  of  melanosomes,  and,
further,  promote  the  degradation  of
melanosomes.42 Treatment options will
be discussed in detail in Chapter 33, but
must include a good high-SPF sunscreen
with UVA protection and sun avoidance
(Box 13-1). The sunscreen must be worn
24  hours  a  day.  Sun  avoidance,  UVA
screens for car and home windows, and
protective  clothing,  such  as  hats,  are  a
great addition to a topical treatment reg-
imen.  Topical  treatments  may  include
hydroquinone  2%  to  4%,  low-potency
steroids, kojic acid, arbutin, azelaic acid,
hydroxy  acids,  and  retinoids.  Topical
tretinoin  improves  epidermal  hyperpig-
mentation  by  decreasing  tyrosinase
activity and melanin production as well
as  enhancing  the  desquamation  of  the
epidermis.43 Although  tretinoin  0.1%
has been studied as a single agent in the
treatment  of  melasma,44,45 the  time  to
improvement  is  lengthy  (10  months,  in
one  study).  Therefore,  most  physicians
use  a  combination  of  topical  products.
The “Kligman formula” is a mixture con-
sisting  of  0.1%  tretinoin,  5.0%  hydro-
quinone,  0.1%  dexamethasone,  and
hydrophilic  ointment.46 It  has  been  a
very popular melasma treatment since
its introduction in 1975; however, this
formula  is  currently  not  commercially
available and must be formulated by a
pharmacy. A prescription combination

mula  that  contains  hydroquinone  4%,
tretinoin  0.05%,  and  fluocinolone
0.01% has been approved by the FDA

BOX 13-1 Regimen for  Patients With
Melasma

Morning:
1. Wash with a cleanser that contains an

alpha hydroxy acid.

2. Apply a product with hydroquinone, kojic

acid, or azelaic acid.

3. Apply a UVA/UVB broad-spectrum

sunscreen.

4. Wear a hat and avoid sun and heat when

possible.

5. Take an antioxidant supplement such as

pycnogenol (see Chapter 34).

Evening:
1. Wash with a cleanser that contains an

alpha hydroxy acid.

2. Apply a retinoid such as Retin-A, Renova,
Differin or Tazorac, or a product with
hydroquinone and a retinoid such as 
Tri-Luma.

Undergo an in-ofﬁce peel every 2 weeks

(i.e., Jessner’s, glycolic, or salicylic acid).
Slowly increase the strength of the peel as
tolerated. Some physicians use microder-
mabrasion prior to the peel to increase pene-
tration of the ingredients.

Note: Some patients develop exogenous
ochronosis, or increased pigmentation, on
exposure to hydroquinone. A good history
should be taken and if the patient is sensitive
to hydroquinone, it should be avoided.
Azelaic acid (Azelex) is another option that is
useful in all patients but especially those who
cannot tolerate hydroquinone.

there are specialized pharmacies that will
prepare formulations with higher concen-
trations of hydroquinone. The stability of
such  creams  is  questionable  as  retinoids
and  hydroquinone  can  work  in  opposi-
tion,  thus  diminishing  overall  efficacy  if
not  formulated  properly.  The  author
advises using the FDA-approved formula-
tions rather than those compounded by a
pharmacy.

Topical  steroids  have  depigmenting
effects with an unknown mechanism. It
has  been  proposed  that  they  decrease
both production and secretion of melanin
in  the  melanocytes.46 However,  because
of potential side effects, such as skin atro-
phy as well as triggering acne and telang-
iectasia,  the  use  of  steroids  is  limited  to
low-potency  formulas  unless  they  are
combined with a retinoid. Retinoids have
been shown to help prevent the atrophy
that occurs with topical steroids.47

Recent  studies  have  shown  that  gly-
colic acid is also beneficial in enhancing
the  effectiveness  of  hydroquinone.48
The  addition  of  glycolic  acid  facilitates
penetration  of  both  agents  and  hence

promotes  efficacy.  Glycolic  acid  can  be
used in a chemical peel formulation or as
an  additive  to  home  products.  Glycolic
acid  peels  and/or  Jessner’s  peels  can  be
used in combination with topical agents
to hasten the resolution of melasma (see
Chapter 20). Lawrence et al. found that
Jessner’s solution and 70% glycolic acid
(combined  with  tretinoin  and  hydro-
quinone between peels) worked equally
well in the treatment of melasma.41

The  addition  of  kojic  acid  may  also
improve  the  efficacy  of  topical  agents
according  to  other  recent  studies.
Research  performed  in  Singapore  fol-
lowed 40 Chinese women treated with
2%  kojic  acid  in  a  gel  containing  10%
glycolic  acid  and  2%  hydroquinone  on
one-half  of  the  face.49 The  other  half
was  treated  with  the  same  application
but  without  kojic  acid.  The  patients
were  observed  for  12  weeks.  All
in
patients  showed 
melasma on both sides of the face; how-
ever, the side treated with the combina-
tion containing kojic acid showed more
improvement.  More  than  half  of  the
melasma  cleared  in  24  of  the  40  (60%)
patients  receiving  kojic  acid  compared
to  19  of  40  (47.5%)  patients  receiving
the gel without kojic acid.

improvement 

A  tretinoin  acid  peel  is  another
acceptable  option  in  patients  with
melasma. In a study of 10 Asian women
with melasma, although a 1% tretinoin
peel  was  as  effective  as  a  70%  glycolic
acid peel, the tretinoin was better toler-
ated by the patients.50

Because there are so many treatment
options and compliance is a vital aspect
of  treating  this  condition,  the  regimen
should be easy for the patient to under-
stand.  Many  companies  such  as  La
Roche-Posay, Obagi, and Topix package
products in an easy-to-follow treatment
regimen.  Skin  care  regimens  are  often
combined  with  microdermabrasion,
light treatments, or laser; however, it is
the  author’s  opinion  that  proper  skin
care  and  education  are  paramount  for
the successful treatment of this disorder.
Intense pulsed light (IPL), a noncoher-
ent broadband light source ranging from
500  to  1200  nm,  is  another  available
option  for  melasma  treatment.  This 
procedure is very popular because there
is minimal down time and it offers a low
risk of side effects. In a study conducted
by Wang et al. on 31 Asian women with
dermal  and  mixed  melasma,  IPL  treat-
ment on a monthly basis was compared
to  4%  topical  hydroquinone;  35%  of
patients in the IPL group showed more
than  50%  improvement,  compared  to
14%  in  the  control  group.51 The  initial

as 

cutoff filter was 570 nm, and 590 to 615
filters were used for the remaining treat-
ments to target deeper components. As
expected,  epidermal  melasma  treated
with IPL seems to have more promising
results 
to  dermal
compared 
melasma.52 Although IPL is considered a
safe  treatment,  postinflammatory  pig-
ment  alteration  (PIPA)  remains  a  possi-
bility. Therefore, IPL must be used with
caution for individuals with darker skin
tones.  This  treatment  will  not  be  suc-
cessful without a proper skin care regi-
men and sun avoidance.

The  Q-switched  Alexandrite  laser
(755 nm) has also been successfully used
to treat melasma.53 In addition, this laser
has  been  used  in  conjunction  with  the
UltraPulse  CO2  laser.54,55 In  one  study,
the  combination  of  the  Q-switched
Alexandrite  laser  and  UltraPulse  CO2
was  associated  with  more  side  effects
than  the  Q-switched  Alexandrite  laser
alone,  though  the  combination  treat-
ment was more effective.55

Fractional photothermolysis is a new
option  for  lightening  hyperpigmented
areas  of  the  face.  In  a  study  performed
by  Rokhsar  et  al.,  10  patients  with
refractory melasma and Fitzpatrick skin
types III to V received four to six treat-
ments  with  a  Fraxel  laser  (Reliant
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) at 1-
to 2-week intervals; 60% of the patients
showed 75% to 100% clearance of their
melasma based on the physician evalua-
tion56 (see Chapter 26).

Patient  education  is  one  of  the  most
important  aspects  of  a  melasma  treat-
ment  regimen.  Most  patients  do  not
realize  the  important  role  of  UV  radia-
tion  in  this  condition,  particularly  the
capacity of UVA rays to penetrate glass.
Patients  should  be  instructed  to  wear,
during  all  daylight  hours,  a  broad-
spectrum  UVA  and  UVB  sunscreen  of
the  highest  SPF  that  they  can  tolerate.
Patients should also understand that no
sunscreen  offers  complete  protection;
therefore, sun avoidance should also be
practiced.  Because  patients  may  have
difficulty  seeing  the  improvement  in
their  skin,  serial  photography  with  a
regular camera and a UV camera can be
used to document treatment response.57

SOLAR LENTIGOS 

Up to 90% of elderly patients have one
or  more  solar  lentigos.58 As  the  name
suggests, the sun is the culprit here, with
both acute and chronic exposure linked
to  engendering  these  macular  brown
lesions  usually  1  cm  in  diameter.  Solar
lentigos are more common in men than

such as TCA, glycolic acid, and combi-
nation  peels  have  been  used  for  many
years  for  the  treatment  of  solar  lentig-
ines.65–67 Although  effective,  the  pain
and  burning  sensation  that  especially
accompanies treatment of a large surface
area  may  be  a  limiting  factor.  Several
studies  have  compared  the  efficacy  of
these  various  treatments.  An  ingenious
method  developed  by  Hexsel  utilizes  a
tiny dermabrasion instrument to remove
the solar  lentigos.68 She  treated  10
female  patients  who  had  solar  lentigos
on the backs of their hands with either
localized  dermabrasion  or  cryotherapy.
More  than  50%  of  the  patients  treated
with  cryotherapy  continued  to  display
hypochromia  in  the  treated  areas  6
months after treatment, compared with
11%  of  the  patients  treated  with  der-
mabrasion. The percentage of recurrence
of solar lentigos was the same with both
treatments (55.55%). In a study compar-
ing  liquid  nitrogen  to  35%  TCA  in  the
treatment of solar lentigines of hands in
25 patients, cryotherapy was found to be
superior  with  71%  of  subjects  showing
50% or more improvement compared to
47%  improvement  with  TCA  peel.69 In
this  study,  although  most  patients
believed  that  TCA  peel  has  the  fastest
healing  time,  liquid  nitrogen  was  rated
more efficacious.

Laser therapy has also been shown to
be effective in treating solar lentigos. One
study  examining  the  efficacy  of  the  Q-
switched  ruby  laser  in  the  treatment  of
solar  lentigos  demonstrated  a  response
rate of 70% after one or two treatments.70
The  Alexandrite  755  nm,71 Q-switched
Nd:YAG 532 nm, long pulse Nd:YAG 532
nm,72 1550-nm  diode-pumped  erbium
fiber  laser  (Fraxel),73 and  IPL74 have  all
been used in the treatment of solar lenti-
gos with success. These methods will be
further discussed in Chapter 24. Although
lasers are very effective for these lesions,
patients  should  be  warned  that  treated
areas will be red or have a scab for approx-
imately  7  to  10  days  depending  on  the
type of laser used. The most common side
effect  of  laser  treatment  is  PIPA.  A  rare
side effect worth mentioning is chrysiasis
after treatment with Q-switched lasers in
patients  previously  treated  with  oral  or
parenteral gold.75–77 Therefore, it is recom-
mended that all patients get screened for
past gold treatment.

Topical  creams  and  bleaching  agents
are good alternatives for patients who do
not  wish  to  undergo  aggressive  treat-
ments.  Topical  retinoids  (i.e.,  tretinoin,
tazarotene,  and  adapalene)  are  effective
options and can be used alone or in com-
bination with other bleaching agents such

women, as opposed to ephelides (freck-
les),  which  are  reportedly  more  com-
mon in women.59 The face and backs of
hands  are  the  typical  areas  affected.
These  lesions  are  seldom  seen  among
patients  younger  than  50    years  and,
therefore,  have  also  been  called  “senile
lentigos.” The sun, rather than age, is the
causative factor, however. These lesions
do not occur on sun-protected skin, even
in the elderly (Fig. 13-7). Solar lentigos,
ephelides,  and  lentigos  simplex  are
difficult  to  distinguish  from  each  other
clinically.  Taken  together,  these  types 
of  lesions  constitute  a  significant  risk
factor  for  melanoma  and  basal  cell
carcinoma.60,61

Histopathology

cells 

Solar  lentigos  exhibit  elongated  rete
ridges  that  contain  deeply  pigmented
intermingled  with
basaloid 
melanocytes. Also, they have an elevated
number  of  melanocytes,  which  have
been shown to have an increased capac-
for  melanin  production.58 The
ity 
melanin content of the epidermis in facial
solar  lentigos  has  been  demonstrated  to
be  2.2  times  higher  than  that  in  photo-
damaged skin.62 Solar lentigos can be dis-
tinguished  from  freckles  histologically
because  freckles  do  not  have  elongated
rete  ridges  and  have  a  normal  or  lower
number of melanocytes (Fig. 13-8).

Prevention  of  solar  lentigos  is  best
achieved through use of sunscreens and
in  JAMA
sun  avoidance.  A  study 
revealed  that  sunscreen  usage  helped
reduce  the  occurrence  of  nevi  in  white
children.63 Because  increased  numbers
of these nevi are associated with an ele-

vated risk of melanoma, the importance
of  preventing  the  onset  of  such  lesions
cannot be overstated.

Treatment

Solar  lentigos  can  be  treated  with  vari-
ous methods depending on convenience
for  the  patient.  For  example,  some
patients may want to treat with slower
methods  that  require  no  down  time;
other patients want to have the lesions
removed in as few office visits as possi-
ble  and  don’t  mind  the  down  time.  All
patients should be treated with a home
regimen of sunscreen and a combination
of  topical  retinoids,  topical  bleaching
agents,  and  hydroxy  acids.  For  those
patients who want faster and more visi-
ble  results,  TCA  peels,  lasers  (e.g.,  Q-
Switch Ruby, Alexandrite, and Nd:Yag),
local dermabrasion, and cryotherapy can
be  used.  When  treating  a  patient  with
cryotherapy, only a single freeze thaw is
recommended, since an aggressive treat-
ment may lead to scarring and hypopig-
mentation.64 Chemical  peeling  agents

as  hydroquinone  and  azelaic  acid.
Retinoids have the ability to increase the
penetration  of  bleaching  agents  and
chemical  peels  in  addition  to  decreasing
melanin  production.  Tretinoin  0.01%  in
combination  with  4-hydroxyanisole
(Mequinol)  has  been  shown  to  be  effec-
tive in the treatment of solar lentigos.78,79
Ortonne  et  al.  reported  the  effect  of  4-
hydroxyanisole 2%/tretinoin 0.01% solu-
tion, and sunscreen in 406 patients with
solar  lentigines  for  up  to  24  weeks;  325
patients  (88%)  had  an  almost  complete
fading  of  their  facial  lesions  and  298
(81%)  experienced  the  same  in  targeted
forearm lesions.80 In another study, Kang
et  al.  treated  90  patients  exhibiting  solar
and actinic lentigines with adapalene gel
(0.1% or 0.3%) and compared the results
to its vehicle; 1 month following the treat-
ment patients treated with adapalene gel
showed  significant  lightening  of  their
solar  lentigines.81 In  addition,  the  use  of
tazarotene 0.1% cream once daily in 562
patients  with  facial  photoaging  for  24
weeks  showed  improvement  of  the
lentigines  and  mottled  hyperpigmenta-
tion by at least one point using a seven-
point  scale  (0  represented  complete
response  and  6  denoted  worsening),
when  compared  to  its  vehicle.82 This
treatment was followed by an additional
28 weeks of tazarotene 0.1% cream treat-
ment,  and  continuing  improvement  was
observed  with  no  plateau  effect.83
Accordingly,  it  is  important  to  inform
patients that it may take a few months for
topical  retinoids  to  show  depigmenting
results.

It is also important to remember that
patients with multiple solar lentigos are
at  an  increased  risk  for  skin  cancer.
There is no evidence or reason to believe
that  successful  treatment  of  these
lesions leads to a lower melanoma risk.
Therefore,  patients  with  significant
numbers  of  solar  lentigos,  treated  or
untreated,  should  undergo  routine  skin
cancer examinations.

“TANNING-BED” LENTIGINES

The development of unusual melanocytic
lesions  after  exposure  to  UVA  tanning
beds has been reported. Clinically, these
lesions  appear  similar  to  the  lentigines
that occur after psoralen photochemother-
apy.84 The histologic examination of these
lentigos  has  revealed  melanocytic  hyper-
plasia  and  cytologic  atypia.85 Therefore,
patients with these lesions may be at an
increased  risk  of  skin  cancer.  These
patients  should  be  cautioned  about  the
hazards  of  tanning  bed  use  and  should
have annual skin examinations.

POSTINFLAMMATORY 
HYPERPIGMENTATION

Postinflammatory  hyperpigmentation,
also  known  as  postinflammatory  pig-
ment  alteration  (PIPA),  can  occur  as  a
result  of  various  skin  disorders.
Occasionally, therapies for skin disease
can  cause  or  exacerbate  dyschromia.
This is most common in patients with
darker skin types. A patient’s pigmenta-
tion  risk  can  be  assessed  based  on  his-
torical  information  by  utilizing  the
Baumann Skin Typing System discussed
in Chapter 9 or by having patients take
the  related  self-administered  question-
naire, the Baumann Skin Type Indicator
(BSTI),  which  is  available  online  at
www.SkinIQ.com.  Although  postin-
flammatory hyperpigmentation appears
most  frequently  among  patients  with
darker skin types, it can afflict people of
any  skin  color.86–88 Those  of  Asian
ancestry  tend  to  be  susceptible  to  PIPA
even when their skin tone is light. Minor
conditions  such  as  acne,  eczema,  and
allergic reactions can lead to PIPA. Also,
more  serious  cutaneous  events  (e.g.,
burns,  surgeries,  and 
trauma)  or
treatments  (e.g.,  chemical  peels  and
laser  resurfacing)  can  precipitate  it.
Unfortunately,  this  phenomenon  tends
to recur in susceptible individuals.89

PIPA  presents  as  irregular,  darkly  pig-
mented spots arising in areas of previous
inflammation.90 Postinflammatory hyper-
pigmentation can appear in any part of the
skin, but is a particularly significant source
of  distress  to  patients  when  it  occurs  on
the face. In fact, PIPA is one of the most
common  conditions  responsible  for
spurring patients to visit a dermatologist.

Etiology

Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is
a consequence of increased melanin syn-
thesis in response to a cutaneous insult.
It can be diffused or localized and its dis-
tribution depends on the location of the
original injury.

Histopathology

PIPA  is  characterized  by  numerous
melanophages in the superficial dermis.
An  infiltrate  of  lymphohistiocytes  may
be seen around superficial blood vessels
and in dermal papillae.91

Treatment

PIPA is difficult to treat because it occurs
in  individuals  susceptible  to  hyperpig-
inflammation.
mentation following 

Further inflammation, as induced by peels
or  lasers,  would  therefore  worsen  the
process. Consequently, only nonirritating
topical  products  such  as  hydroquinone,
kojic  acid,  and  retinoids  are  potentially
useful  to  treat  this  condition.  These
agents provide minimal efficacy, though.
The best treatment approach is sun avoid-
ance, sunscreen use, and patience because
these lesions tend to improve with time.

UNDER EYE CIRCLES

Under  eye  circles  are  a  common  com-
plaint  by  both  men  and  women.  The
cause  of  these  dark  circles  under  the
is  poorly  understood.  Many
eyes 
believe  that  the  thin  skin  in  this  area
allows  the  blood  vessels  to  become
more  visible.  Any  inflammation  or
vasodilation  in  this  area  may  manifest
as darkening. In a Japanese study, it was
demonstrated that the lower and lateral
parts of the internal canthus have high
blood mass and low velocity and there-
fore  contribute  to  dark  circles  around
eyes.92 However, there also seems to be
a pigmentary component to this process
that is poorly understood. There are sev-
eral  anecdotal  reports  of  using  pig-
mented lesion lasers such as the ruby or
Nd:Yag to treat these lesions; however,
there  are  no  published  data  evaluating
these therapies. Many cosmetic compa-
nies  claim  that  their  creams  erase  dark
circles.  These  creams  usually  contain
depigmenting  agents;  however,  it  has
never been proven that this condition is
caused  by  excessive  melanin  produc-
tion. In fact, some physicians have pos-
tulated  that  the  circles  are  caused  by
hemosiderin  deposition.  Unfortunately,
there is no published research to explain
the etiology and best treatment of under
eye  circles.  For  now,  it  seems  certain
that the best therapeutic approaches are
sunscreen and increased rest. There are
currently no available treatments proven
to be effective.

Recently, prostaglandin analogs such
as  latanoprost  and  bimatoprost,  used
for  the  treatment  of  glaucoma,  have
been  reported  to  cause  periocular
hyperpigmentation.93–95 In a study con-
ducted by Doshi et al. on 37 Caucasian
patients  on  bimatoprost  who  devel-
oped  periocular  hyperpigmentation,
this  condition  was  noted  in  3  to  6
months  after  initiation  of  treatment
and  resolved  within  3  to  12  months
following  discontinuation  of 
the
medication.95 Eyelid biopsies of patients
with  hyperpigmentation  following
bimatoprost treatment revealed increased

recalcitrant  disorders 

In 
such  as
melasma,  camouflage  cosmetics  can  be
used to give the patient a more natural
appearance  during 
treatment
process. These products are opaque and
do  not  allow  the  underlying  skin  tones
to be seen. The product is usually a thick
cream  that  can  be  made  to  match  a
normal  skin  tone,  thus  masking  the
underlying  abnormality.  Some  compa-
nies  have  developed  advanced  tech-
niques  using  a  spectrophotometer  to
measure  skin  color.  The  data  from  the
spectrophotometer  are  used  to  create  a
pigment-rich  foundation  that  exactly
matches the patient’s skin tone. Because
skin  tones  are  so  widely  varied,  these
products  provide  the  best  solution  for
patients with hard-to-match skin tones.
Another option is to use a color that is
complementary  to  the  unwanted  color.
For example, green can be used to cover
red  discolorations,  or  purple  to  cover
yellow discolorations. Yellow and white
camouflage  products  are  the  most
effective in treating melasma and other
brown  pigmentation  disorders.  Patients
then  apply  their  normal  facial  founda-
tion over the color camouflage in order 
to  achieve  the  most  natural 
look. 
There  are  many  brands  of  cover
cosmetics  available  including  Cover
Blend,  Covermark,  Christian  Dior,
Dermablend,  Hard  Candy,  Joe  Blasko,
MAC, and Neutrogena.

SUMMARY

All skin types are susceptible to pigmenta-
tion disorders. Such alterations can be par-
ticularly  prominent  in  people  with  dark
skin tones. Therapy is difficult and occa-
sionally  frustrating  for  patients  and  der-
matologists alike as it requires protracted
topical  application  of  agents,  sun  avoid-
ance, and, often, in-office chemical peels.
Unfortunately, there is no panacea to treat
these intractable disorders and attempts at
resolving  the  particular  condition  often
entail  trying  many  different  therapies
with varying degrees of success.

Skin of Color

Heather Woolery-Lloyd, MD

Skin of color describes individuals with
increased epidermal pigment and darker
skin. This subset of patients has unique
cosmetic  concerns  and  often  requires
special  consideration  for  cosmetic  pro-
cedures. Skin of color is typically seen in
those  of  African,  Hispanic,  Asian,  and
Southeast Asian descent.

BIOLOGY OF SKIN COLOR 

There is little variation in the number of
epidermal  melanocytes  between  light-
and  dark-skinned  individuals.  There 
are  approximately  2000  epidermal
melanocytes/mm2 on  the  head  and 
forearm  and  1000  epidermal  mela-
nocytes/mm2 on  the  rest  of  the  body.
These  differences  are  present  at  birth.1
Thus,  all  persons  have  the  same  total
number of melanocytes.

Although  increased  epidermal  pig-
mentation results in a darker skin phe-
notype, there are actually more distinct
ultrastructural  characteristics  that  cor-
relate  with  skin  color.  Specifically,  the
distribution of melanosomes in the ker-
atinocytes correlates with skin color. In
white skin, melanosomes are small and
aggregated in complexes. In black skin,
there  are  larger  melanosomes,  which
are  singly  distributed  within  ker-
atinocytes.2

Interestingly,  the  distribution  of
melanosomes in darker skin varies with
the  location  on  the  body.  In  lighter 
skin,  keratinocytes  of  both  the  thigh
and  volar  skin  exhibit  complexed
melanosomes.  However,  keratinocytes
from the thighs of dark-skinned patients
display  singly  dispersed  melanosomes,
while keratinocytes from the lighter volar
skin  of  these  patients  have  complexed
melanosomes.3 Thus,  the  melanosomes
in the minimally pigmented volar skin of
dark-skinned  individuals  closely  resem-
ble  the  melanosomes  of  lighter-skinned
individuals. This finding further supports
the theory that skin color correlates with
the  distribution  of  melanosomes.  From
such  studies,  one  can  conclude  that
melanosome  distribution  correlates
with  the  color  of  skin;  however,  skin

color  is  also  determined  by  other  fac-
tors.

One study examined the contribution
of melanin, oxyhemoglobin, and deoxy-
hemoglobin  on  pigmentation  observed
clinically after ultraviolet B (UVB) expo-
sure.  The  investigators  found  that  the
clinical  evaluation  of  skin  complexion
was affected both by epidermal melanin
concentration  and  deoxyhemoglobin
residing in the superficial venous plexus.
Additionally,  altering  the  concentration
of  deoxyhemoglobin  in  the  skin  with
pressure  or  with  topical  therapies  also
significantly altered what is visually per-
ceived as skin pigmentation.4,5

CATEGORIZING SKIN OF COLOR 

Fitzpatrick Skin Typing System

Skin of color is most frequently defined
as  Fitzpatrick  skin  phototypes  (SPT)  IV
through VI. These skin types, by defini-
tion,  tan  easily  or  profusely  and  burn
minimally, 
rarely,  or  never.  The
Fitzpatrick  SPT  system  was  originally
developed to assess a patient’s response
to UV exposure for the purpose of treat-
ing  skin  conditions  with  light.6 Using
this system, patients are assigned a skin
type based on the reported ability to tan
or  burn.  The  SPT  defines  a  minimum
erythema  dose  (MED)  for  each  skin
type, which is then used to guide dosing
of UV therapy for various skin diseases.
This  skin  typing  system  has  since
evolved  into  a  way  to  describe  a
patient’s  skin  color.  Dermatologists
often  assign  a  patient’s  SPT  based  on
their  clinical  assessment  of  skin  color
and  not  necessarily  after  questioning
about a patient’s history of sun tanning
or burning (Table 14-1).

The Fitzpatrick SPT system originally
categorized  only  white  skin  and

included  skin  types  I  to  IV.  All  skin  of
color  (brown  or  dark  brown  skin)  was
identified  as  SPT  V  skin.  SPT  VI  skin
was  later  added  to  further  classify  skin
of color.7 Although this system is widely
accepted and used frequently in derma-
tology,  it  does  not  fully  address  certain
issues related to the darker skin types.

There are two issues that arise when
using  the  Fitzpatrick  SPT  system.  First,
some  authors  have  challenged  the  abil-
ity to predict a patient’s MED based on
the  reported  ability  to  tan  and  burn.  In
one  study  involving  white  patients,
there  was  a  poor  correlation  between
SPT (as determined by self-reported tan-
ning  history)  and  MED.  This  study
found a better correlation between MED
and  skin  complexion  characteristics
such as eye and hair color, freckling ten-
dency,  and  number  of  moles.8 Other
studies in Asian and Arab patients have
also  demonstrated  a  poor  correlation
between skin phototype (based on tan-
ning  history)  and  MED.9–12 These
authors have suggested that the SPT sys-
tem, which was originally developed for
white skin, is not applicable in patients
of other ethnicities.

The  second  issue  with  the  SPT  sys-
tem  involves  the  correlation  of  visually
assessed skin color with MED. As men-
tioned above, most dermatologists often
assign  a  patient’s  SPT  based  on  their
clinical  assessment  of  skin  color,  and
rarely specifically question a patient on
skin tanning history. Some authors have
proposed  that  SPT  (as  determined  by
observed  skin  color)  does  not  correlate
with the MED in ethnic skin. They sug-
gest that in skin of color, the constitutive
pigment  does  not  correlate  with  MED,
as  is  suggested  by  the  current  conven-
tional application of SPT.4

For example, most patients of African
descent  are  conventionally  labeled  as

Fitzpatrick  skin  type  V  (brown)  or  VI
(dark brown). However, upon question-
ing,  some  of  these  patients  report  that
they do frequently burn. This subset of
patients  likely  would  be  classified  as
having  a  skin  type  of  III  or  IV,  if  they
were  truly  categorized  based  on  a  self-
reported  tanning  history.  One  study
compared  skin  pigmentation  as  mea-
sured  by  diffuse  reflectance  spec-
troscopy  (DRS)  of  MEDs.4 This  study
confirmed  that  epidermal  pigmentation
was  not  an  accurate  predictor  of  skin
sensitivity to UVB radiation.

Such  research  highlights  the  limita-
tion  of  the  SPT,  which  was  originally
designed  to  evaluate  lighter  skin  types.
Although the Fitzpatrick SPT continues
to  be  widely  used,  other  systems  have
been  proposed  to  more  clearly  define
skin of color.

Japanese Skin Type Scale

A Japanese skin type (JST) scale has been
used to classify Japanese patients based
on  personal  history  of  sun-reactivity.13
This  scale,  which  ranges  from  JST-I  to
JST-III, has been correlated with MEDs
and minimal melanogenic dose (MMD)
in Japanese patients. The MED and the
MMD  have  been  shown  to  increase
with  increasing  JST.  The  MMD  was
shown to be greater than corresponding
MED for all JST types.14 These data are
in  contrast  to  data  in  Caucasian  skin,
revealing that the MED was the same as
MMD in SPT II and MMD was less than
MED  in  SPT  III  and  IV.15 The  authors
proposed that UVB may elicit more ery-
thema  than  pigmentation  in  Japanese
patients.

Taylor Hyperpigmentation Scale

The  Taylor  Hyperpigmentation  Scale  is
a validated scale to describe skin of color
and  to  monitor  treatment  of  hyperpig-
mentation.16 It  consists  of  15  plastic
cards representing different hues in skin
phototypes  IV  through  VI.  Each  card
also  has  10  bands  of  progressively
darker gradations of skin hue. Clinicians
can use this system to assess and define
skin color in a given patient. The Taylor
Hyperpigmentation  Scale  also  provides
a  simple,  convenient  tool  to  measure
improvement  after  treatment  of  hyper-
pigmentation (Fig. 14-1).

Lancer Ethnicity Scale

The  Lancer  Ethnicity  Scale  (LES)  was
specifically developed to assess risk and
outcome in the cosmetic laser patient.17

the patient’s ethnicity, an LES skin type
ranging from 1 to 5 is assigned to each
grandparent. The LES skin type is based
on  the  geographic  origin  of  the  grand-
parent, ranging from type 5 (African) to
type  1  (Nordic).  The  number  is  totaled
for  all  four  grandparents  and  then
divided  by  four  to  determine  the  LES
skin type of the patient. The author sug-
gests  that  the  lower  the  LES  skin  type,
the lower the risk of scarring and uneven
pigmentation  after  laser  and  surgical
procedures. The LES is a novel approach
to treating the cosmetic patient. It places
a  greater  emphasis  on  ethnicity  and
country  of  origin  than  the  patient’s
actual skin color. This concept is insight-
ful but more studies are needed to vali-
date this novel skin typing system.

Baumann Skin Typing System

Baumann’s Skin Typing System addresses
a  very  important  cosmetic  concern  in
skin of color, namely, the propensity to
develop  hyperpigmentation.18 It  does
not  define  ethnicity  or  skin  color.
Rather,  this  questionnaire  aids  in  pre-
dicting which patients are most likely to
hyperpigment after a given procedure. It
also  addresses  the  fact  that  there  are
some  patients  with  Fitzpatrick  skin
types IV to VI who do not have a strong
tendency to hyperpigment despite their

constitutive pigment. Thus, certain pro-
cedures may be less risky in this special
group.  At  the  same  time,  there  are
some  patients  with  Fitzpatrick  skin
type  III  with  a  strong  propensity  to
develop  hyperpigmentation.  By  deter-
mining each individual patient’s hyper-
pigmentation  tendencies,  this  survey
provides  an  excellent  tool  to  the  cos-
metic  dermatologist.  It  can  offer  fur-
ther insight into treatment options for
a  given  patient  that  transcends  the
visual  assessment  of  skin  complexion
(see Chapter 9).

DEFINING STRUCTURE AND 
FUNCTION IN SKIN OF COLOR

Comparative  studies  of  skin  structure
and function in skin of color are limited.
It is important to note that most studies
on this subject involve small numbers of
patients. Much of the data are contradic-
tory and can be difficult to interpret. In
the following section, these findings will
be summarized.

Stratum Corneum: Thickness 
and Compaction

The  stratum  corneum  (SC)  has  been
extensively  studied  in  black  and  white
skin. Most studies confirm that SC thick-
ness  does  not  differ  between  black  and
white  individuals.19–23 However,  studies
have suggested that the SC of black skin
is  more  compact  than  white  skin.22,24
Using repeated tape stripping, investiga-
tors reported that black skin required an
average of 16.6 strips to remove the SC
compared to 10.3 strips in white skin.22
The authors concluded that although SC
thickness was equal in both groups, the
SC in black skin has more cell layers and
increased  intracellular  adhesion.  A  sub-
sequent study confirmed these findings.
The investigators in this later study also
examined  recovery  time  after  barrier
damage  and  found  that  darker  skin
recovered  more  quickly  after  barrier
damage from tape stripping.24 This study
included  African  American,  Asian,  and
Hispanic subjects and found that the skin
differences  in  SC  cell  layers  and  barrier
function  were  related  to  skin  color  and
not related to race. Thus, it appears that
although  SC  thickness  is  the  same
between  the  races,  darker  skin  is  more
compact (Table 14-2).

Stratum Corneum: Lipid Content,
Ceramides, and Barrier Function

Lipids in the SC play an important role
in  the  barrier  function  of  the  skin.  The

major 
lipids  of  the  epidermis  are
ceramides,  cholesterol,  and  free  fatty
acids. Studies have shown that there is
greater  lipid  content  in  black  SC  when
compared  to  white  SC.25,26 Once  the
lipids  are  removed  from  the  SC,  the
weight  of  delipidized  SC  is  equal  in
black and white patients.22

Although  greater  overall  lipid  content
has  been  demonstrated  in  black  SC,  a
study  in  the  early  1990s  showed  that
ceramide levels were lowest in black skin.
In this report, ceramide levels were noted
in decreasing order in Hispanic and Asian,
white,  and  black  skin.  Ceramide  levels
were  inversely  correlated  with  transepi-
dermal  water  loss  (TEWL).  Additionally,
the  ceramide  levels  directly  correlated
with water content of the SC.27

There  is  only  one  study  examining
lipid  content  in  Asian  patients.  Scalp
lipids  in  British  and  Thai  subjects  were
compared, with investigators finding no
difference  in  scalp  lipids  between  the
two groups.28

Based  on  the  various  studies  dis-
cussed,  the  data  regarding  racial  differ-
ences  in  lipid  content  are  unclear  and
inconclusive.

Stratum Corneum: TEWL and Barrier
Function

skin  indicate  that  TEWL  is  greater  in
black skin than white skin.27,29–32 There
are  also  six  studies  that  contradict
these findings. Five reported no differ-
ence  in  baseline  TEWL  between  the
black  and  white  subjects,33–37 and  one
reported  decreased  TEWL  in  black
patients.38 The  variations 
the 
results  of  the  latter  study  may  be
explained  by  the  location  of  the  skin
examined.39

in 

Data  on  TEWL  of  Asian  skin  are
inconclusive. Studies have reported that
TEWL  in  Asian  skin  is  greater  than,
equal  to,  and 
less  than  TEWL  in
Caucasian  skin.27,31,40 One  study  com-
paring  Chinese,  Malaysian,  and  Indian
subjects demonstrated no differences in
TEWL (as measured by skin vapor water
loss)  among  the  three  groups.41 There
has been no difference demonstrated in
TEWL  between  Hispanic  and  white
skin.34,42

From  the  studies  involving  black
subjects, five out of eleven studies con-
cluded  that  TEWL  was  increased  in
black  skin  either  at  baseline  or  after
irritation.  The  significance  of  these
data  is  far  reaching.  If  skin  color  truly
does  impact  barrier  function,  these
data  would 
that  acquired
imply 
dyschromias  may  alter  skin  barrier
properties.39 It  also  has  implications
regarding  the  ability  of  people  with
different  skin  colors  to  tolerate  envi-

ronmental insults and to absorb topical
agents.

Stratum Corneum: Corneocyte
Surface Area and Spontaneous
Desquamation

Corneocytes  are  the  nonnucleated  cells
that  comprise  the  SC.  Corneocyte  sur-
face  area  has  been  demonstrated  to
influence  skin  permeabilty.43 A  study
examining  corneocyte  surface  area  in
black, white, and Asian subjects demon-
strated no differences in corneocyte sur-
face area among the groups.44

In  the  same  study,  spontaneous
desquamation  was  measured  in  black,
white,  and  Asian  subjects.  The  investi-
gators  found  that  spontaneous  corneo-
cyte  desquamation  was  equal  in  white
and  Asian  patients;  however,  sponta-
neous  corneocyte  desquamation  was
in  black  patients.44 The
greatest 
increased  desquamation  seen  in  this
study  may  explain  the  dry  “ashy”  skin
often  seen  clinically  in  black  patients
(Fig. 14-2). Subsequent studies have not
confirmed these data. One study reported
a  greater  desquamation  index  in  white
subjects.38 Another  study  reported  no
difference  in  the  desquamation  index
between black and white patients.45 The
data  on  the  differences  in  spontaneous
corneocyte  desquamation  between
these populations remain unclear.

112

TEWL  is  one  measure  of  SC  barrier
function. Five studies of TEWL in black

 
 
 
cadaveric  skin  may  not  reflect  in  vivo
absorption.  Thus,  the  data  regarding
percutaneous absorption in skin of color
are inconclusive.

Cutaneous Blood Vessel Reactivity

Cutaneous blood vessel reactivity can be
measured via Laser Doppler Velocimetry
(LDV)  or  photoplethysmography  (PPG).
LDV is a noninvasive method to measure
the flow of red blood cells in vasculature.
PPG  measures  the  pulsative  changes  in
dermal  vasculature  and  is  synchronized
with  pulse  rate.39 These  methods  have
been  used  to  measure  skin  irritancy  to
topical  products,  absorption  of  topicals,
and efficacy of topical medications. Nine
studies compared blood vessel reactivity
among  ethnic  groups  via  LDV.  One  of
these studies also examined blood vessel
reactivity via PPG. In all studies, a topical
agent was applied (i.e., vasodilator, vaso-
constrictor, or irritant) and then reactiv-
ity to the given agent was measured.

In the six studies that included black
subjects, two showed no difference,30,51
three  showed  decreased  blood  vessel
reactivity  in  black  subjects,31,52,53 and
one showed increased blood vessel reac-
tivity in black subjects when compared
to white subjects.54

Two  studies  compared  Hispanic  and
white  subjects  and  found  no  difference
in  LDV  response  to  a  topical  irritant  or
nicotinate.42,55

Three studies included Asian patients.
Two  studies  demonstrated  increased
blood  vessel 
in  Asian
patients,31,54 and one showed no differ-
ence  in  blood  vessel  reactivity  when
compared to white patients.40

reactivity 

Much  of  the  data  on  blood  vessel
reactivity in skin of color are difficult to
interpret because in each study different
topical  agents  were  used.  However,  in
five of the nine studies, the authors con-
cluded that there was no significant dif-
ference  between  the  subjects  studied.
Further research is needed to clarify the
data on cutaneous blood vessel reactiv-
ity in skin of color.

Skin Irritancy

The impact of ethnicity on skin irritancy
is  controversial.  Original  studies  used
visual  perception  of  erythema  as  a  pri-
mary  endpoint.56–58 This  method  of
assessing  cutaneous  irritancy  has  obvi-
ous limitations in darker skin types. The
earlier studies suggested that black sub-
jects were less sensitive to irritants than
white  subjects.30,42 As  described  in  pre-
vious  sections,  much  of  this  research

(cid:2) FIGURE 14-2 Dry skin presents as “ashy skin” in dark-skinned patients.

Stratum Corneum: Water Content

Water  content  in  the  skin  can  be  mea-
sured  by  capacitance,  conductance,
impedance,  and  resistance.  There  are
seven  studies  in  the  literature  using
these  methods  to  compare  water  con-
tent 
in  the  skin  of  black,  white,
Hispanic, and Asian subjects.

Five  studies  examined  black  and
white  skin.  Three  studies  showed  no
significant differences.30,37,45 In the latter
study,  skin  hydration  correlated  with
scaliness  that  was  seen  clinically.  One
study  showed  increased  water  content
in  black  skin  while  another  suggested
decreased  water  content 
in  black
skin.38,46

One  study  examined  Hispanic  and
white  subjects  and  found  no  difference
in  water  content  at  baseline.42 Later
work contradicts these data. This subse-
quent study showed racial variability in
SC  water  content  among  white,  black,
and Hispanic patients.34 The water con-
tent values also varied by anatomic site.
In  the  only  study  that  included  Asian
patients,  Asian  skin  was  found  to  have
higher water content than white, black,
and Hispanic subjects.27

Based  on  a  summation  of  the
research,  there  does  not  appear  to  be  a
clear  trend  in  the  difference  in  water
content  among  various  ethnic  groups.
Indeed, the data on this subject are con-
tradictory and inconclusive.

Percutaneous Absorption

Percutaneous absorption has been stud-
ied  in  black  and  white  patients.  Three
studies estimated absorption via urinary
excretion  of  a  topically  applied  sub-
stance.  Two  studies  saw  no  difference
between black and white patients, while
the  other  showed  decreased  urinary
excretion  in  black  patients.47–49 All  of
these studies had a limited sample size.
One additional study examined absorp-
tion in white and black cadaveric skin.50
The authors reported decreased absorp-
tion in the black cadaveric skin.

Based on a summation of the studies,
it is difficult to confirm any differences
in  percutaneous  absorption  in  skin  of
color.  The  studies  measuring  urinary
excretion  are  limited  by  other  possible
variables  such  as  incomplete  urine  col-
lections, renal function, and metabolism
differences.  In  addition,  the  study  of

 
 
 
revealed  inconsistent  and  contradictory
data. Subsequent authors have reviewed
and  reexamined  the  research  on  skin
irritancy  in  an  effort  to  determine  if
definitive  conclusions  can  be  made
regarding  skin  irritancy  in  skin  of
color.39,59,60 Most  authors  agree,  from
the  current  data,  there  does  not  appear
to be a clear increase or decrease in skin
irritancy in skin of color.

Stinging,  a  manifestation  of  sensory
irritation, has also been studied in differ-
ent  skin  types.  Early  reports  suggested
that stinging was most frequent in fair-
skinned  persons  of  Celtic  ancestry.61 A
subsequent study showed no skin type
propensity  for  stinging.  The  authors
reported  that  increased  stinging  was
most related to a history of sensitivity to
soaps,  cosmetics,  and  drugs62
(see
Chapter 17).

Most epidemiologic studies of allergic
contact  dermatitis  demonstrate  equal
incidence  among  ethnicities.63–66 Thus,
based  on  current  objective  data,  there
does  not  appear  to  be  any  clear  differ-
ence  in  skin  irritancy  in  skin  of  color
when  compared  to  white  skin  (see
Chapter 18).

pH, Elastic Recovery/Extensibility,
Mast Cell Granules, Epidermal
Innervation

Three studies have examined pH in skin
of  color.32,37,38 One  demonstrated
decreased  pH  in  black  skin  after  three
tape strips but not at baseline, or after 9,
12, or 15 tape strips.32 Another showed
decreased  pH  in  black  skin  when  com-
pared  to  white  skin  on  the  cheeks  but
not  the  legs.38 The  most  recent  study
revealed  no  difference  in  pH  between
black  and  white  subjects.37 The  data
from these three studies are insufficient
to  draw  any  definitive  conclusions  on
pH in skin of color.

Elastic  recovery  and  extensibility
have  also  been  studied  in  black  and
white  skin.34,38 The  current  data  are
inconsistent  and  conflicting.  Based  on
the  data,  no  conclusion  can  be  made
regarding skin biomechanics in different
races.

Mast cell size and characteristics have
been studied in black skin. In one study,
no histologic differences in the number
and size of mast cells were identified.23
However,  electron  microscopy  of  mast
cells  in  black  skin  demonstrated  larger
granules, more parallel–linear striations,
and  less  curved  lamellae.  Tryptase  was
localized to the parallel-linear striations
in black skin and localized to the curved
lamellae  in  white  skin.  In  this  small

study,  significant  structural  differences
were demonstrated in mast cells of black
subjects.67

Pruritus, atopic dermatitis, and macu-
lar  amyloid  are  frequently  described  in
many  Asian  populations.  Epidermal
innervation  has  been  studied  in  Asian
and  Caucasian  patients  to  investigate
differences  in  skin  innervation.  No  dif-
ferences  in  innervation  as  measured  by
confocal  microscopy  were 
found
between European Caucasian, Japanese
American,  and  Chinese  American 
subjects.68

Melanin and Melanosome
Distribution

As  described  previously,  it  is  well
established that differences in pigmen-
tation are caused by the size and distri-
bution  of  melanosomes  within  the
keratinocytes.2 Darker-skinned  subjects
have large, singly dispersed melanosomes
while 
lighter-skinned  subjects  have
small grouped melanosomes within ker-
atinocytes.  Subsequent  research  con-
firmed  and  expanded  on  the  role  of
melanosomes in skin color. These stud-
ies  demonstrated  that  melanosome
grouping  correlates  with  the  degree  of
pigmentation in white, black, and Asian
subjects.69,70 Darker-skinned  black
subjects  had  large,  singly  dispersed
melanosomes  while 
lighter-skinned
black  subjects  had  both  large,  singly
distributed  melanosomes  and  small
grouped  melanosomes.  Similarly,  dark-
skinned  white  subjects  had  singly  dis-
persed  melanosomes  on  sun-exposed
skin, while light-skinned white subjects
with minimal sun exposure had grouped
melanosomes.  Melanosome  grouping
was  also  correlated  with  sun  exposure.
Asian forearm skin primarily had singly
distributed  melanosomes  while  unex-
posed  abdominal  skin  had  grouped
melanosomes.69,70

Further research has determined that
the  ability  of  a  melanosome  to  form
aggregates  is  determined  by  its  size.
Research  suggests  that  melanosomes
greater  than  0.35  (cid:2)m  cannot  form
groups.69,70

Basal cell layer melanosomes and total
melanin  content  also  correlate  with  the
degree  of  pigmentation.  Darkly  pig-
mented  skin  has  increased  melanin  as
measured  by  cell  culture.71 Darkly  pig-
mented  skin  also  has  increased  density
of basal cell layer melanosomes.69 Fewer
basal layer melanosomes were observed
in fair-skinned Asian patients when com-
pared  to  darker-skinned  individuals.72
Additional  studies  have  shown  that,  in

black  skin,  melanosomes  are  not  only
increased in the basal layer but also dis-
tributed throughout all layers of the epi-
dermis.23,73 This  is  in  contrast  to  white
skin  where  melanosomes  are  primarily
limited to the basal layer.

The  protease-activated  receptor-2
(PAR-2)  expressed  on  the  keratinocyte
plays  a  role  in  melanosome  uptake  via
phagocytosis.  Trypsin  activates  PAR-2 
in vivo. Investigators have demonstrated
that  PAR-2  and  trypsin  have  greater
expression  in  darkly  pigmented  skin
when compared to lighter skin. In addi-
tion,  PAR-2-induced  phagocytosis  is
more  efficient  in  darker  skin  types.
These  data  suggest  that  PAR-2  expres-
sion may play a role in darker skin phe-
notypes74 (see Chapter 13).

Epidermis: Overall Architecture

It  is  well  established  that  SC  thickness
does  not  differ  among  ethnicities.19–23
Overall  skin  thickness  as  measured  by
calipers  also  does  not  differ  between
white  and  black  subjects.75 Differences
in  the  architecture  of  the  epidermis
between  the  races  involve  melanin  and
melanosome  distribution  as  described
above.  Other  differences  in  epidermal
architecture  are  related  to  UV  damage.
These changes are described below.

PHOTOAGING IN SKIN 
OF COLOR 

UV Reactivity and Photoprotection

The  photoprotection  conferred  by
melanin in darkly pigmented skin greatly
influences  the  UV-induced  differences
observed  in  black  and  white  skin.
Epidermal architecture in black and white
subjects supports this notion. One study
demonstrated an intact, compact stratum
lucidum  in  sun-exposed  black  skin,  in
contrast  to  a  swollen,  cellular  stratum
lucidum in sun-exposed white skin. Black
skin rarely exhibited atrophy, while white
skin had numerous focal areas of atrophy,
necrosis, vacuoles, and dyskeratosis.23

Melanin clearly offers protection from
UV light. It acts as a neutral density filter
to reduce penetration of all wavelengths
of  light  equally.76 In  a  study  using  skin
samples from blacks and whites, investi-
gators  found  that  5  times  as  much  UV
light reached the upper dermis of white
skin when compared to black skin. The
authors determined that the main site of
UV  filtration  in  white  patients  was  the
SC, compared to the malpighian layer in
black  patients.  The  average  protection
offered  by  melanin  in  black  skin  was

calculated to be equivalent to a sun pro-
tective factor (SPF) of 13.4 compared to
3.4 for white skin. They concluded that
the  photoprotection  observed  in  black
skin was due to both increased melanin
content  and  the  unique  distribution  of
melanosomes in dark skin.76

Another  study  examined  biopsies  in
black  and  white  skin  before  and  after
solar-simulating  radiation  (SSR).  After
SSR, white skin displayed epidermal and
dermal DNA damage, an influx of neu-
trophils,  active  proteolytic  enzymes,
and  diffuse  keratinocyte  activation.
Black  skin  only  demonstrated  DNA
damage  in  the  suprabasal  dermis.  This
study  of  acute  changes  after  SSR  con-
firms  the  significance  of  UV  protection
imparted by melanin.77

Racial differences in MED have been
described.  Darkly  pigmented  black  skin
has been determined to have an MED up
to 33 times greater than that of individu-
als  with  white  skin.70 In  Japanese  sub-
jects, MED has also been correlated with
skin color. In this study, the investigators
found  that  the  greater  the  epidermal
melanin content, the less severe the reac-
tion to the sun.78 It is important to note,
however, that darker skin is not always
predictive of MED. As mentioned previ-
ously, in darker skin, pigmentation does
not  consistently  correlate  with  MED.4
Other  factors  may  influence  the  ability
to tan or burn in skin of color.

The process of skin tanning in differ-
ent  racial  ethnic  groups  has  been  stud-
ied.  The  most  significant  change  noted
after  1  MED  exposure  was  an  upward
shift in the distribution of melanin to the
middle  layers  of  the  epidermis.  This
change  was  most  dramatic  in  darker
skin.  Such  data  provide  the  basis  for  a
better  understanding  of  tanning  in  the
darker skin types.79

One  study  examined  skin  in  Korean
subjects and the cumulative response to
sun  exposure.  Investigators  compared
constitutive  and  facultative  (acquired)
pigmentation  in  different  age  groups.
Facultative pigment of sun-exposed skin
in Caucasians appears to reflect cumula-
tive lifetime UV exposure. In this study,
constitutive pigment was highest during
the first decade of life, decreased during
the second decade, and was maintained
during the third decade of life in Korean
subjects. In contrast to Caucasians, fac-
ultative  pigmentation  did  not  increase
with age.80

Histologic Findings

Despite  the  photoprotection  conferred
by  darker  skin,  chronologic  aging  has

been  observed  in  black  skin.  In  one
study, older black subjects demonstrated
flattening of the dermal–epidermal junc-
tion  when  compared  to  younger  sub-
jects.73 Elastic fiber degeneration and an
increase  in  the  superficial  vascular
plexus  were  also  noted  in  the  aged
group.  The  skin  of  older  black  subjects
was also characterized by a decrease in
the number of melanocytes.73

A study in older Thai patients with
a  history  of  high  sun  exposure  also
showed epidermal atrophy, cell atypia,
poor polarity, and disorderly differen-
tiation.81
In  a  study  of  Japanese
patients, the relationship between skin
phototype  and  facial  wrinkling  was
examined.  As  expected,  higher  scores
were  recorded  for  deep  wrinkles  in
individuals  with  Fitzpatrick  SPT  I.
Interestingly,  the  same  tendency  was
not  demonstrated  for  fine  wrinkle
scores.82

Clinical Findings

The  clinical  signs  of  aging  in  skin  of
color have been described. In a study of
French Caucasian and Chinese subjects,
wrinkle  onset  was  delayed  by  approxi-
mately  10  years  in  Chinese  women.
Hyperpigmentation  was  a  much  more
important  sign  of  aging  in  Chinese
women.83

In a study of Japanese and Caucasian
patients,  young  Japanese  patients  had
significantly  lower  wrinkle  scores.  The
sagging  score  was  also  significantly
lower in Japanese subjects older than 40
years  when  compared  with  Caucasian
subjects.  Lower  face  aging  was  more
common in Caucasian subjects.84

In  African  Americans,  the  clinical
signs  of  aging  are  less  pronounced  and
tend  to  be  delayed  at  least  a  decade
when  compared  to  Caucasian  skin.
Many  patients  complain  of  dark  circles
and  hollowing  beneath  the  eyes,  while
others  experience  lower  eyelid  bags.
Lower-eyelid signs of aging usually start
with  midface  aging  during  the  30s.  In
midface  aging,  the  malar  fat  pad
descends from its location overlying the
infraorbital  rim  and  accumulates  along
the  nasolabial  fold.  This  can  lead  to  a
hollowed  appearance  beneath  the  eyes
and  an  apparent  deepening  of  the
nasolablial fold.85 It is important to note
that  these  changes  occur  with  intrinsic
aging and are less related to photodam-
age.  Photoaging  in  darker  skin  is  mani-
fested  primarily  by  uneven  pigmenta-
tion, which is one of the most common
cosmetic complaints in skin of color. The
presence of seborrheic keratosis and der-

matosis  papulosa  nigra  is  another  com-
mon  clinical  sign  of  aging  in  patients
with skin of color.

Based  on  these  studies,  photoaging,
although delayed, does occur in skin of
color. Despite the significant protection
offered by melanin in darker skin types,
these data suggest that photoprotection
should  still  be  emphasized  in  patients
with skin of color.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
REGARDING STRUCTURE AND 
FUNCTION IN SKIN OF COLOR

Dermis: Overall Architecture

In  a  comparison  of  black  and  white
facial  skin,  dermal  differences  are  evi-
dent. Some of these changes are related
to  UV  damage  and  include  decreased
elastosis in black skin.23

Other  differences  appear  to  be  pri-
mary  variations 
in  the  fibroblasts,
macrophages,  and  giant  cells.  In  one
study, black skin was reported to contain
more fiber fragments composed of colla-
gen fibrils and glycoproteins. Fibroblasts
were more numerous and larger in size.
They  were  frequently  binucleated  and
multinucleated. Additionally, there were
more  binucleated  and  multinucleated
macrophages and giant cells.23

The changes described in fibroblasts
are especially significant in skin of color
because of the increased risk of keloids
and  scarring  in  these  patients.  Other
differences in dermal structures reported
between the races are described below.23

ECCRINE GLANDS Research on ethnic dif-
ferences in eccrine sweat glands is con-
tradictory. Of the four studies measuring
sweat  production  in  black  and  white
subjects, two reported decreased sweat-
ing  in  black  subjects  and  two  reported
no difference.86–89

Four  other  studies  have  measured
resistance  to  indirectly  assess  eccrine
gland activity. They have shown increased
resistance  in  darker-skinned  patients,
which  suggests  increased  eccrine  gland
activity.46,90–92

Based on these studies, no conclusion
can  be  made  on  eccrine  gland  activity
between different ethnic groups.

APOCRINE  GLANDS Research  on  ethnic
differences in apocrine glands is limited.
Two  small  nonblinded  studies  suggest
that  apocrine  glands  are  larger  in  black
subjects.93,94 One larger histologic analy-
sis  reported  that  apocrine  glands  are
more numerous in black skin.90 Based on

these  data,  apocrine  glands  may  be
increased in black individuals.

APOCRINE-ECCRINE  GLANDS Apocrine-
eccrine  sweat  glands  have  features  of
both  eccrine  and  apocrine  glands.  One
study of facial skin reported more numer-
ous apocrine-eccrine glands in black skin
when compared to white skin.23

SEBACEOUS GLANDS Studies of sebaceous
glands  and  sebaceous  gland  activity
reveal contradictory findings. One study
reported increased sebaceous gland size
in  black  patients.95 Another  study
reported increased sebum production in
black patients.96 Three studies indicated
no difference in sebaceous gland activity
between black and white subjects.37,97,98
Research in Japanese subjects, however,
found a correlation between skin surface
lipids and increased pigmentation78 (see
Chapter 10).

HAIR Hair  composition  and  structure
has  been  studied  between  the  races.
There  is  no  difference  in  keratin
between  black  and  white  subjects.99
One study has shown some differences
in amino acid composition; however, a
follow-up  study  demonstrated  no
difference.100,101

Vellus hair follicular density has been
studied in African American, Asian, and
Caucasian  subjects.  It  has  been  pro-
posed  that  vellus  hair  follicles  are  a
potential  reservoir  for  topically  applied
substances. Vellus follicular hair density
was  lower  in  African  Americans  and
Asians  when  compared  to  white  sub-
jects.  The  authors  suggested  that  this
difference  may  impact  skin  absorption
in different ethnic groups.102

Differences in terminal hair structure
between the races have been well stud-
ied and are described below.

AFRICAN  HAIR In  subjects  of  African
descent, four distinct hair types are rec-
ognized:  straight,  wavy,  helical,  and 
spiral.  The  spiral  hair  type  is  the  most
common  subtype.103 African  hair  has  a
flattened elliptical shape in cross-section
with  a  ribbon-like  appearance.104 The
hair is typically coiled tightly, and most
naturally  shed  hairs  have  a  frayed  tip.
Spontaneous  knotting  is  often  seen.
Longitudinal  splitting,  fissures,  and
breaking  of  the  hair  shaft  are  also
observed.105

Other  studies  of  black  hair  have
revealed  that  black  subjects  had  fewer
elastic  fibrils  anchoring  the  hair  to  the
dermis.23 This  has  implications  in  sev-
eral forms of alopecia frequently seen in

black patients, particularly traction alope-
cia.  Additionally,  there  is  decreased  hair
density  in  African  American  subjects
when compared to white subjects.106

CAUCASIAN  HAIR Caucasian  hair  is  typi-
cally straight or slightly curved. The hair
is  elliptical  in  cross-section.  It  has  the
smallest cross-sectional area among eth-
nic groups and naturally shed hairs usu-
ally  have  the  original  or  cut  tip.104

SUMMARY

Understanding  the  unique  characteris-
tics of skin of color is extremely impor-
tant in cosmetic dermatology. The most
well-defined  and  distinct  differences  in
skin  of  color  pertain  to  melanin  in  the
skin. Increased melanin in skin of color
offers  a  significant  advantage  to  these
patients, namely, a delay in photoaging.
The disadvantage of melanin also has
great  impact  in  cosmetic  dermatology,
as  this  constitutive  pigment  increases
the  risk  of  hyperpigmentation  from
many cosmetic procedures.

Apparent differences in fibroblasts in
skin  of  color  also  greatly  impact  the
practice of cosmetic dermatology. These
fibroblast  differences 
likely  place
patients  with  skin  of  color  at  increased
risk  of  hypertrophic  scars  and  keloids
after  invasive  surgical  and  laser  proce-
dures.

More than half of the world’s popula-
tion has skin of color. Despite this fact,
our understanding of skin structure and
function  is  limited  in  these  patients.
Research  to  date  has  been  quite  com-
pelling; however, most research on skin
of color is preliminary. Further research
and larger population studies are neces-
sary to definitively describe the similari-
ties and differences in skin structure and
function  among  the  various  ethnic
groups.

Acne (Type 1
Sensitive Skin)

Leslie Baumann, MD
Jonette Keri, MD, PhD

Any discussion of the practice of cosmetic
dermatology must include a discussion of
acne. Although acne is not typically con-
sidered  to  be  a  “cosmetic”  problem,  its
highly visible nature makes it a very com-
mon complaint among cosmetic patients
who  are  by  definition  concerned  about
their  appearance.  Acne  can  often  have  a
profound  psychological 
impact  on
patients.  Recently,  an  evaluation  of  the
psychosocial implications of acne on self-
image and quality of life found that it may
be equivalent to disorders such as asthma
or epilepsy.1 Acne can be especially trou-
blesome  to  adults  who  perceive  them-
selves  as  too  old  to  have  this  condition
most often associated with adolescence.

Acne vulgaris is a common, multifacto-
rial  process  involving  the  pilosebaceous
unit.  More  than  17  million  people2 and
75% to 95% of all teens3 are affected by
some  form  of  acne  each  year  in  the
United  States  alone.  The  majority  of
patients  outside  this  age  range  are  adult
women who typically exhibit a hormonal
component to their acne. Approximately
12% of women will have acne until the
age of 44, whereas only 3% of men will
have  acne  until  the  same  age.4 In  many
cases, adults are more surprised and upset
by  acne  onset  than  are  teenagers.  In  all
cases, though, early and individually tai-
lored treatment is necessary to achieve a
satisfactory  cosmetic  appearance  for  the
patient.  This  chapter  will  include  a  brief
survey  of  the  salient  aspects  of  acne
pathophysiology  as  well  as  suggestions
for  treatment  and  prevention.  The  psy-
chosocial  aspects  of  acne,  or  the  signifi-
cant psychological distress that this con-
dition  provokes,  is  beyond  the  scope  of
this chapter. It is worth noting, however,
that  many  patients  seeking  treatment
only  for  acne  report  substantial  anxiety
associated with this disease. Regardless of
acne severity, acne is also one of the chief
concerns  of  patients  with  body  dysmor-
phic disorder5 (see Chapter 40).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ACNE

ally associated with one another, with the
latter  often  succeeding  the  former.
Inflammation of the follicular epithelium,
which  loosens  hyperkeratotic  material
within  the  follicle  creating  pustules  and
papules,  characterizes  acnegenesis  (Fig.
15-1). Comedogenesis is best described as
a  noninflammatory  follicular  reaction
manifested by a dense compact hyperker-
atosis of the follicle, and usually precedes
acnegenesis. Because the etiology of such
lesions varies from person to person and
within  individuals  also,  it  is  difficult  to
categorically  identify  or  isolate  a  basic
cause  of  acne;  however,  three  principal
factors have been identified. The primary
causal  factors  in  acne  work  interdepen-
dently and are mediated by such impor-
tant influences as heredity and hormonal
activity.

Sebaceous Gland Hyperactivity

Sebum  is  continuously  synthesized  by
the sebaceous glands and secreted to the
skin  surface  through  the  hair  follicle
pore.  The  excretion  of  lipids  by  the
sebaceous glands is controlled hormon-
ally. The sebaceous glands are located all
over the body but are largest and most
numerous  in  the  face,  back,  chest,  and
shoulders.  These  glands  become  more
active  during  puberty  because  of  the

increase 
in  androgens,  particularly
testosterone,  which  spurs  sebum  pro-
duction. This imbalance between sebum
production  and  the  secretion  capacity
leads to a blockage of sebum in the hair
follicle followed by inflammation.

Hormones  continue  to  affect  seba-
ceous  gland  activity  into  adulthood.  In
males, lipid secretion is regulated by the
action  of  testosterone.  In  females,  the
immediate  increase  in  luteinizing  hor-
mone following ovulation incites acceler-
ation  in  sebaceous  gland  activity.  The
higher sebum secretion then stimulates or
exacerbates acne breakouts usually 2 to 7
days prior to menstruation. Women expe-
riencing  excessive  androgen  states,  such
as  those  seen  in  polycystic  ovarian  dis-
ease, frequently suffer from acne as well.
The notion that sebum plays a key role
in acnegenesis is buttressed by several facts
including its comedogenicity, data showing
that it causes inflammation when injected
into  the  skin,  and  the  reportedly  higher
level of sebum production in people with
severe  acne.6 Researchers  have  also
reported  that  acne  patients  possess  larger
sebaceous glands than the general popula-
tion.7 Furthermore, drugs that inhibit seba-
ceous  gland  activity,  such  as  antiandro-
gens,  estrogens,  and  oral  retinoids,  are
integral  treatment  modalities  in  the  suc-
cessful control of acne.

The  literature  reveals  no  discernible
differences in the sebum composition of
acne  patients  as  compared  to  age-
matched controls. Strauss and Thiboutot
have  noted,  though,  an  inverse  relation-
ship  between  sebum  secretion  and
linoleic  acid  concentration  in  the  sebum
of  acne  patients—the  higher  the  sebum
secretion, the lower the linoleic acid con-
centration.7 Downing et al. theorized that
the lower concentrations of linoleic acid,
which  correlated  with  the  high  sebum
secretion rates of acne patients, leads to a
localized deficiency of essential fatty acid
of  the  follicular  epithelium.8 This  defi-
ciency  then  contributes  to  diminished
epithelial  barrier  function  and  follicular
hyperkeratosis, which aggravates acne.

Changes in Follicular Keratinization

tend 

to  stick 

In  the  lower  portion  of  the  follicular
infundibulum,  the  normal  process  of
keratinization  occurs  in  the  same  way
that it occurs on the skin’s surface. This
maturing  of  keratinocytes  and  subse-
quent exfoliation into the follicle marks
the beginning of the formation of come-
dones.  In  acne  patients,  these  ker-
atinocytes 
together
because  of  the  effects  of  positive  and
negative charges, the actions of transg-
lutaminase, and the stickiness of sebum.
The  clumped  keratinocytes  block  the
pore/follicle, creating a blackhead if the
pore  is  open  (“open  comedone”)  or  a
whitehead if it is closed (“closed come-
done”) (Fig. 15-2). The clogged pore is a
great  nutritional  source  for  bacteria  so
Propionibacterium  acnes gravitate  to  the
blocked pores. The immune system rec-

ognizes  the  presence  of  bacteria  and
mounts  an  immune  response  resulting
in redness, pus, as well as inflammation,
and  the  typical  “pimple”  results.  Most
of the inflammation, however, is likely
due to inflammatory mediators that are
released  when  bacteria  digest  sebum
(Fig. 15-3).

The Inﬂuence of Bacteria

P.  acnes has  been  cited  as  the  cause  of
acne  because  it  is  typically  present  in
teenagers with acne and not those with-
out  acne.7 However,  P.  acnes is  com-
monly found in the facial flora of adults
with or without acne. The exact role of
bacteria is therefore unclear. It is known
that  sebum  accumulation  because  of
excess lipid secretion and hyperkeratosis
at the infundibulum leads to an increase
in P. acnes around the hair follicles. The
presence  of  the  bacteria  is  likely  not  a
direct cause of acne breakouts, though. It
is more likely that the inflammation seen
in acne is caused by free fatty acids that
result  from  the  breakdown  of  triglyc-
erides  in  the  sebum  owing  to  bacterial
lipases.  Other  extracellular  enzymes,
proteases,  and  hyaluronidases  may  also
play a role in the inflammatory process.7
The role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
has  been  a  recent  topic  of  avid  interest
regarding  the  pathogenesis  of  acne.
According  to  Heymann,  these  trans-
membrane proteins, when activated by
ligands,  modulate  the  expression  of
numerous  immune  response  genes.9
Evidence suggests that P. acnes, through
its  several  secreted  proinflammatory
products,  can  induce  TLR  expression

In vitro work on monocytes has shown
that  all-trans-retinoic  acid  led  to  down-
regulation  of  TLR2,  yielding  more
details  regarding  the  retinoid  mecha-
nism of action10 (see Chapter 4).

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

There are several acne variants and disor-
ders  with  similar  presentations.  A  brief
survey  of  these  conditions  appears  near
the  conclusion  of  this  chapter.  In  addi-
tion,  many  other  dermatologic  condi-
tions  can  be  confused  with  acne  (Box 
15-1). These are unrelated conditions, but
can be mimics.

The Basic Lesion

The  fundamental  acne  lesion  is  the
microcomedo,  or  microcomedone,  an
enlarged  hair  follicle  full  of  sebum  and 
P.  acnes.  Although  there  is  a  long  list  of
materials that can cause comedones, the
mechanism  of  spontaneous  comedone
formation  is  unknown.11 The  comedo
that remains beneath the skin is a white-
head; a comedo that opens to the surface
of the skin is labeled a blackhead because
it  appears  black  on  the  epidermis.  The
diverse  array  of  other  acne  lesions
includes papules (small, inflamed lesions
presenting  as  pink,  tender,  nonpustular
bumps);  pustules  (small,  inflamed,  ten-
der,  pustular  lesions,  usually  red  at  the
base); nodules (relatively large, spherical,
painful lesions located deeper in the der-
mis);  and  cysts  (even  deeper,  inflamed,
pustular,  painful  lesions  that  can  cause
scarring) (Figs. 15-4 and 15-5).

TREATMENT

There  are  several  therapeutic  regimens
for  acne,  most  of  which  focus  on  pre-
vention of future eruptions rather than
treatment of present lesions. This is the
reason  that  the  majority  of  treatments
take 8 weeks to work. Only salicylic acid,
benzoyl  peroxide,  and  steroids  treat  lesions
already  visible  on  the  skin.  Steroids,

(cid:2) FIGURE 15-3 A close-up of the hair follicle and sebaceous gland demonstrating the different stages of acne. A. Desquamation of ker-
atinocytes occurs in the same way that it does on the skin’s surface. However, instead of sloughing into the environment, the keratinocytes
slough into the hair follicle. This is a continuous and normal process that represents the culmination of the cell cycle. B. The ﬁrst stage of
acne is also known as comedogenesis. The sloughed cells stick together inside the hair follicle, resulting in a clogged pore or comedone.
This is caused by several factors including increased amounts of sebum, inﬂammation of the sides of the hair follicle preventing the release
of the desquamated keratinocytes, and inceased cohesion of keratinocytes. C. The keratinocyte plug and sebum is an excellent food source
for bacteria. The bacteria invade the comedone and release inﬂammatory factors that lead to the next stage of acne. D. Inﬂammation con-
tinues with increased redness and pus. This is clinically detectable as a papule or pustule. E. Continued inﬂammation may lead to so much
inﬂammation that the hair follicle ruptures and the bacteria and debris are released into the dermis. When severe, this can lead to scarring.

The Five Steps
NORMALIZING  KERATINIZATION/EXFOLIATION
The  first  step  in  controlling  acne  is  to
prevent  the  exfoliated  keratinocytes

levels  of 

from  sticking  together  (Box  15-2).
Retinoids  achieve  this  goal  by  reducing
the  positive  and  negative  charges  that
render the cells sticky and by decreasing

ELIMINATING  OR  REDUCING  P. ACNES
BACTERIA The  use  of  antibiotics  or
benzoyl  peroxide  attacks  the  bacterial
population thereby decreasing the level
of  inflammatory  extracellular  products
induced by P. acnes (Box 15-3). The two
antibiotics  that  are  most  commonly
used in the treatment of acne, and have
been shown to be equally effective,15 are
erythromycin and clindamycin. In addi-
tion to being antibacterial, these agents
exhibit  anti-inflammatory  activity  as
they lower the percentage of inflamma-
tory free fatty acids produced by bacter-
ial digestion of surface lipids.16

The  escalating  incidence  of  antibiotic
resistance is also an important considera-
tion when treating the bacterial aspect of
acne.  Recent  research  suggests  that  as
many  as  60%  of  acne  patients  exhibit
antibiotic-resistant strains of P. acnes.17 A
recent review of 50 controlled trials found
that  there  was  a  gradual  decrease  in  the
efficacy of topical erythromycin, but that
the efficacy of topical clindamycin stayed
the same.17 The preponderance of bacte-
ria remain sensitive to medication in most
of these patients, but an increasing num-
ber of patients have gradually developed
less  sensitive  or  more  resistant  strains.
Regardless, the use of two modalities (i.e.,
benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic)
in  acne  therapies  has  been  shown  to
decrease the resistance.

Although standard dosing regimens
of  oral  antibiotics  remain  a  mainstay
of treatment, newer lower-dose antibi-
otic  formulations  represent  submicro-
bial  dosing  and  again  are  seen  as  a
prudent approach to combating bacte-
rial  resistance.  With  such  low-dose
antibiotics, the drug works as an anti-
inflammatory  agent  rather  than  an
antimicrobial.

Patients  with  cystic  acne,  or  those

regimens,  can  be  treated  with  oral
retinoids such as isotretinoin (Fig. 15-6).
This is the only class of drugs that nor-
malize  keratinization  as  well  as  reduce

shown that a marked decrease in sebum

AHAs versus BHA
There is a signiﬁcant chemical distinction
between salicylic acid and the alpha
hydroxy acids. The AHAs are water solu-
ble, while salicylic acid is lipid soluble.
Consequently, the distinct hydroxy acid
families enter and function in different
areas of the skin; salicylic acid usually
effects change only in the upper epider-
mis while AHAs are believed to penetrate
the dermis.20,21 This difference might
account for the longer duration of stinging
reported by patients using AHAs as com-
pared to those using BHA.

Because BHA is lipophilic, it is suited, unlike

AHAs, to penetrate the sebaceous material
in the follicles and thus able to induce
exfoliation within the infundibula.22 The
comedolytic properties of BHA were con-
ﬁrmed in a study in which investigators
compared the number of microcomedones
observed in biopsies of women treated with
2% salicylic acid to those in women treated
with 8% glycolic acid.23 The glycolic formu-
lation did not reduce the density of micro-
comedones, whereas BHA application
resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant (p <
0.05) decrease. Salicylic acid is marketed to
patients in a variety of formulations includ-
ing gels, lotions, masks, and cleansers.
Because of its anti-inﬂammatory activity,

salicylic acid is also widely used in acne
peels. A 1995 clinical study by Di Nardo
showed that a product containing a com-
bination of glycolic and salicylic acids
reduced more inﬂammatory acne lesions
than did benzoyl peroxide.24 It is notewor-
thy that this study demonstrated that the
combination of the AHA and BHA was
more effective against acne lesions than
was salicylic acid alone.

Anecdotally, salicylic acid has been reported
to work better than AHAs in the treatment
of rosacea because the anti-inﬂammatory
properties of BHA induce less erythema.
As of the date of this publication, however,
there have been no double-blind studies
to address this purported beneﬁt.

the  sebaceous  follicle.18 Because  it
causes free radical formation, the use of
benzoyl peroxide may lead to exagger-
ated  or  accelerated  aging  of  the  skin
and  its  use  should  be  avoided.  When
applied  at  the  same  time  as  topical
tretinoin,  benzoyl  peroxide  can  dena-
ture  the  tretinoin  and  reduce  its  effec-
tiveness.19

Sodium  sulfacetamide  and  sulfur  are
present in a variety of combination prod-
ucts. Sodium sulfacetamide is an antibac-
terial agent, and the mechanism of action
of sulfur is also thought to be antibacter-
ial in addition to being keratolytic.

REMOVING THE MATERIAL THAT CLOGS THE
PORES Comedolytics,  such  as  salicylic
acid (BHA) and AHAs, are used to loosen
the keratinocytes and “unclog” the pores
(Box  15-4).  BHA  is  more  effective  in
reducing the number of comedones than
are  AHAs  (see  “AHAs  versus  BHA”).
Comedone  extractions  and 
“acne
surgery” can also be performed.

ATTACKING THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE
The  use  of  anti-inflammatory  products,
such  as  salicylic  acid,  is  an  effective
approach to the most physically trouble-

some symptom of acne (Box 15-5). Steroid
injections  and  topical  corticosteroids,
especially  potent  topical  corticosteroids,
pose important risks such as steroid atro-
phy and steroid acne. However, in severe
cystic,  scarring  acne,  oral  corticosteroids
and  intralesional  steroids  may  be  war-
ranted and necessary to prevent scarring.
Finally,  in-office  BHA  peels  are  effective
in reducing the inflammation seen in acne
(Table 15-1).

DECREASING THE LEVEL OF SEBUM The use
of  oral  and  topical  retinoids  decreases
sebaceous gland activity. Hormonal sta-
bilization,  using  oral  contraceptives,  is
also  an  effective  way  for  females  to
reduce  sebaceous  secretions  (Box  15-6).
Although  there  are  currently  only  three
oral contraceptive pills approved by the
FDA  in  the  United  States  for  the  treat-
ment  of  acne  (i.e.,  Ortho  Tri-cyclen,
Estrostep, and Yaz), other such pills can
be  used.  Yaz,  which  was  recently
approved,  is  a  combination  product  of
ethinyl  estradiol  and  drospirenone.  The
drospirenone in this product is an antian-
drogen  and  has  about  the  same  antian-
drogen effect as 25 mg of spironolactone.

MOISTURIZATION AND ACNE

In 1980, Swinyer reported on the differ-
ences between treating acne patients in
a climate with relatively normal humid-
ity in comparison to treatment in a dry
climate. He identified skin dryness as an
important  factor  in  exacerbating  the
pathogenetic  cycle  of  acne,  thus  ham-
pering  its  treatment.25 In  a  subsequent
four-cell  study  that  tested  Swinyer’s
hypothesis,  Jackson  et  al.  conducted  a 
3-month  evaluation  of  the  influence  of
cleansing regimens on the effectiveness
of  acne  therapy  using  10%  benzoyl
peroxide  lotion,  isolating  the  type  of
cleanser  as  the  only  variable.  An
emollient  facial  wash  clearly  outper-
formed pure soap and a benzoyl perox-
ide  wash  in  decreasing  open  come-
dones,  papules,  and  in  overall  global
assessment.26 (Soap  and  placebo  com-
prised  one  cell  of  the  study;  in  each  of
the others, the variable—soap, an emol-
lient,  or  benzoyl  peroxide  wash—was
matched  with  10%  benzoyl  peroxide
lotion.)

Washing the skin with a noncomedo-
genic  agent  appears  to  act  against  acne
and  serves  as  a  suitable  alternative  to
cleansing with relatively abrasive prod-
ucts  while  satisfying  the  acne  patient’s
typical  desire  to  wash  one’s  face.  In
hydrating  while  cleansing,  use  of  an
emollient  facial  cleanser  will  accelerate
the  pace  of  acne  resolution  and  con-
tribute to overall response regardless of
the patient’s treatment regimen.26

ACNE PREVENTION REGIMEN

Regimens  should  contain  products  that
affect each of the five steps of acne for-
mation described above. One such pro-
gram is the following:

AM

1. Washing  with  a  mild  2%  salicylic

acid cleanser.

126

2. Applying a topical antibiotic solution

or azelaic acid.

3. Applying  a  sunscreen  SPF  45  with
moisturizing cream (unless the skin is
very  oily,  in  which  case  the  patient
should try a lotion or gel).

PM

1. Washing with the same salicylic acid

cleanser.

2. Applying a topical retinoid.

The physician might consider adding
in-office salicylic acid peels, oral antibi-
otics  and  retinoids,  and  oral  contracep-
tives in recalcitrant cases. Some make up
foundations  contain  salicylic  acid  as  an
additive to aid in the prevention or ame-
lioration of acne.

COMMON ACNE VARIANTS

Acne Cosmetica

Developing acne as a result of cosmetics
use  is  not  as  common  today  as  it 
was  just  a  couple  of  decades  ago.
Manufacturers  test  their  products  for
comedogenicity  now  before  putting
them  on  the  market.  So,  if  a  person
chooses  nongreasy,  nonocclusive  prod-
ucts,  the  cosmetic  choice  is  unlikely  to
be a source of acne. See Chapter 32 for
more information.

Acne Detergicans

The  obsessive  use  of  soaps  by  patients
may lead to acne. Many facial cleansers
and shampoos contain unsaturated fatty
acids that have been shown to be come-
dogenic.27 Other  components  such  as
bacteriostatic  agents  and  botanical
ingredients  may  irritate  the  hair  follicle
and  cause  acne  as  well.  Therefore,  it  is
important  to  educate  patients  that
washing  does  not  necessarily  improve
acne  because  the  detergents  used  are
only capable of removing surface oil and
do not affect the sebum in the follicles,
where the disease originates. (Of course,
one exception to this would be cleansers
containing salicylic acid, which has been
shown to penetrate into the comedones
and improve them.) Acne detergicans is
uncommon but should be considered in
patients  that  wash  their  face  or  skin
more than 4 times daily.28

Rosacea

This is an acneiform condition typically
presenting in adults between 25 and 60
years  of  age  that  is  characterized  by
facial redness, flushing, papules and pus-
tules,  and  the  formation  of  prominent
blood vessels in the face. These patients
usually  worsen  with  AHAs  and

retinoids  but  do  well  with  antibiotics,
BHA,  and  laser  treatment  of  telangiec-
tasias. The exact cause is unknown, but
rosacea is a condition distinct from acne,
although a patient may have both condi-
tions at the same time (see Chapter 16).

SUMMARY

The  pilosebaceous  unit,  which  com-
prises the hair follicles, the cells that line
them,  and  nearby  sebaceous  glands,  is
the location where acne manifests. This
disease is a function of a complex inter-
play of hereditary, hormonal, and occa-
sional  exogenous  factors.  A  change  in
the inner lining of the hair follicle—cells
turn  over  too  quickly  and  clump
together—results in an inhibition of the
usual passage of sebum and a blockage
at  the  follicular  opening.  This  sets  the
stage for the involvement of P. acnes and
subsequent inflammation.

Just  as  the  etiology  is  complex  and
multifactorial,  the  approach  to  treat-
ment  is  variable  and  requires  several
steps  tailored  to  the  individual  patient.
There is not, to date, one isolated cause
or a panacea—a medication that works
for  all  patients.  Early  intervention  and
preventative treatment are largely effec-
tive in resolving all but the most recalci-
trant cases of this common, cosmetically
altering, and distressing condition.

Rosacea (Type 2
Sensitive Skin)

Sogol Saghari, MD
Jonette Keri, MD
Stuart Shanler, MD
Leslie Baumann, MD

Rosacea  is  a  well  recognized,  chronic,
cutaneous  condition  presenting  as  cen-
tral  facial  erythema,  telangiectasia,
papules, and pustules. A Swedish study
demonstrated  a  prevalence  of  approxi-
mately 10% in the general population.1
In  the  United  States,  it  is  believed  that
there are 13 million people affected with
rosacea. It is usually diagnosed between
the ages of 30 and 50 years and although
both genders can be affected, it is more
common  in  women,  with  more  men
experiencing  the  phymatous  changes.
Rosacea  is  also  more  prevalent  in  fair-
skinned  than  dark-skinned  individuals.
Sun damage, a propensity to flush, and
genetic predisposition are risk factors in
acquiring rosacea.

ETIOLOGY

The  precise  causal  pathway  of  rosacea
still  remains  unknown.  In  addition  to
genetic  predisposition,  many  other  fac-
tors  have  been  implicated  in  the  patho-
genesis  of  rosacea.  These 
include
Demodex  folliculorum mites,  Helicobacter
pylori infection, vascular lability, response
to chemical and ingested agents, and psy-
chogenic  factors.  Sunlight,  heat,  alcohol
consumption,  and  spicy  food  are  also
very  well  known  for  their  contributions
in  aggravating  rosacea  symptoms.  The
association of rosacea and digestive tract
bacteria is controversial. Helicobacter pylori
is a very common infection of the diges-
tive tract and there are studies supporting
both sides of the argument.2–4 It has been
suggested  that  intestinal  inflammation5
and  bacteria  may  cause  hypersensitiza-
tion  of  facial  sensory  neurons  via  the
plasma  kallikrein–kinin  pathway  and
production of bradykinin, a well-known
vasodilator6 (Box 16-1).

Rosacea  is  associated  with  dermal
connective  tissue  damage  and  pilose-
baceous  abnormalities.  The  follicular
immune  response  observed  in  rosacea
has led some authors to suggest that the
pilosebaceous  inflammation  secondary
to Demodex mites and bacteria are the
key  to  developing  rosacea.7,8 Although

BOX 16-1

The kinin-kallikrein system or “kinin system”
is a poorly delineated system of blood
proteins that plays a role in inﬂammation,
blood pressure control, coagulation, and
pain. Its important mediators, bradykinin
and kallidin, are vasodilators.

the  potential  involvement  of  Demodex
mites in rosacea still remains controver-
sial, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9),
also  known  as  gelatinase,  has  been
implicated  with  somewhat  more  confi-
dence  in  the  pathophysiology  of  this
condition. Increased levels of MMP-9, if
not controlled by its inhibitors, result in
an  inflammatory  response  and  the
degradation  of  collagen.  Afonso  et  al.
demonstrated  that  MMP-9  is  increased
in patients with ocular rosacea.9 In addi-
tion, the expression of MMP-9 has been
shown to be increased in the fibroblasts
of patients with Demodex folliculorum and
rosacea  when  compared  to  patients
with rosacea in the absence of Demodex
mites.10 More  research  is  warranted  to
study the correlation between Demodex
mites  and  MMPs  in  the  etiology  of
rosacea.

Another  leading  theory  is  based  on
vascular  response.  Flushing  and  telang-
iectasias are major symptoms in patients
affected with rosacea. A combination of
superficiality  of  cutaneous  vasculature
on the face,11 higher blood flow of facial
skin,12 and  vascular  dysregulation  via
humoral  and  neural  mechanisms13 may
explain  the  rationale  behind  this  the-
ory.14 The mechanism of vasodilatation
and  flushing  is  believed  to  be  both
humoral  and  neural.14 Wilkin  demon-
strated  increased  blood  flow  of  the
cheeks  and  forearms  by  both  the
vasodilator activity of prostaglandins on
vascular smooth muscles (nicotinic acid
test)  and  oral  thermal  challenge  medi-
ated  by  neural  mechanisms.15 In  addi-
tion to prostaglandins, other neurotrans-
mitters  including  histamine,  serotonin,
and substance P may also play a role in
the  erythema  response  of  rosacea.16
Vascular  endothelial  growth  factor
(VEGF) is known to increase angiogene-
sis and vascular permeability.17 A recent
study by Smith et al. demonstrated the
presence of VEGF receptors on vascular
endothelium  in  addition  to  the  expres-
sion of both VEGF and VEGF receptors
on  inflammatory  cells  of  patients  with
rosacea.18 They  proposed  that  VEGF

“receptor-ligand  binding”  may  play  a
role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  this  condi-
tion. Topical antiangiogenic growth fac-
tors  will  likely  be  a  focus  in  future
research on rosacea treatments.19

In  2007,  Richard  Gallo  and  col-
leagues observed that individuals with
rosacea express abnormally high levels
of 
(an
two  proteins:  cathelicidin 
antimicrobial  protein  important  in
mounting an immune response to vari-
ous  bacterial,  viral,  and 
fungal
pathogens) and stratum corneum tryp-
tic  enzyme 
(SCTE),  also  called
kallikrein  5,  a  serine  protease.20 They
demonstrated that when both of these
proteins are present in excess an abnor-
mality  in  enzymatic  processing  occurs
and  yields  high  levels  of  abnormal
cathelicidin, which is proinflammatory,
and  clinically  results  in  the  erythema,
inflammation,  and  vascular  dilatation
and  growth  characteristic  of  rosacea.
Cathelicidins  have  also  been  impli-
cated in the pathophysiology of psoria-
sis  (increased)  and  atopic  dermatitis
(decreased),21 and therapies designed to
modify cathelicidin production are cur-
rently being developed.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATION

Diagnostic Criteria

In  April  2002,  the  National  Rosacea
Society  Expert  Committee  published
an  article  in  the Journal  of  the  American
Academy  of  Dermatology
in  which
diagnostic  criteria  were  discussed22
(Table  16-1.) According  to  the  pub-
lished  diagnostic  guidelines,  the  main
criteria  include  “flushing,”  “nontran-
sient  erythema,”  “papules/pustules,”
and  “telangiectasia,”  where  the  pres-
ence of one or more on the central face
is sufficient for a diagnosis of rosacea.
It  is  important  to  note  that  the  symp-
tom  of  flushing  alone  is  enough  to
diagnose  rosacea.  Experts  have  classi-
fied rosacea into four subtypes and one
variant.22

ROSACEA SUBTYPES The characteristics of
the  four  rosacea  subtypes  are  listed  in
Table 16-2. The condition may progress
from the milder subtypes such as flushing
to  papulopustular  and  phymatous
rosacea.  Patients  may  have  more  than
one subtype. It is important to diagnose
and  treat  rosacea  early  to  try  to  avoid
progression of the disorder. The four sub-
types of rosacea are discussed below.

Phymatous changes

Adapted from Wilkin J, Dahl M, Detmar M, et al.; National Rosacea Society Expert Committee. Standard

tion and staging of rosacea. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2004;50(6):907-912.

for  dermatologists  to  screen  patients
and  ask  them  about  facial  flushing
symptoms.

Subtype  2:  Papulopustular  Rosacea
(Fig. 16-2.) Papulopustular rosacea, also
called  “classic  rosacea,”  presents  with
papules, pustules, and erythema on the
central  face.  Patients  describe  the  ery-
thema  as  persistent  with  episodic
breakouts of papules and pustules. This
type may be misdiagnosed as acne. Age
of  onset  (older  than  30  years  of  age),
absence  of  comedones,  development

after precipitating factors, such as spicy
food,  and  the  presence  of  telangiec-
tasias may help the practitioner to dis-
tinguish  the  papulopustular  form  of
rosacea from acne.

Subtype  3:  Phymatous  Rosacea  (Fig. 16-3.)
Phymatous changes are well recognized
by  thickened  and  uneven  skin  on  the
nose with an irregular surface and nodu-
larities. This is commonly known as the
“WC  Field’s  nose.”  Although  it  most
commonly affects the nasal area, it also
occurs on the malar area and chin. This
type  is  seen  more  commonly  in  men 
and  most  patients  have  been  affected 
for  many  years.  Treatment  modalities
include  isotretinoin,  laser  resurfacing,
and surgical intervention.

Subtype  4:  Ocular  Rosacea  (Fig. 16-4.)
The  ocular  manifestations  of  rosacea
are  usually  nonspecific.  Most  patients
with  ocular  rosacea  complain  of  burn-
ing,  stinging,  itching,  and  watering  of
their  eyes.  Many  may  go  undiagnosed
and  untreated  for  several  years,  since
they  misinterpret  their  symptoms  as
evidence  of  allergies  to  different  sub-
stances. Ocular rosacea should be con-
sidered  if  a  patient  complains  of  or

Subtype 1: Erythemotelangiectatic Rosacea
(Fig. 16-1.) This  subtype  is  character-
ized by erythema (redness) of the cen-
tral face, in addition to telangiectasias
and  flushing.  The  patient  may  only
present  with  one  of  the  mentioned
signs  and  symptoms.  Many  patients
describe worsening of their symptoms
with  aggravating  factors  such  as  hot
beverages,  spicy  food,  sunlight,  heat,
etc.  These  patients  have  a  sensitive
and  irritable  skin  type.  Therefore,
complaints  of  burning  and  stinging
with  topical  skin  regimens  are  com-
mon23 (see Chapter 17). Many patients
in this subtype do not realize that they
have  rosacea  and  therefore  are  not
using the proper skin care to avoid pro-
gression. Consequently, it is important

VARIANTS  OF  ROSACEA The  National
Rosacea  Society  Expert  Committee  has
only recognized one variant for rosacea,
which is the granulomatous form.22 It is
worth  noting  that  pyoderma  faciale
(also  called  rosacea  fulminans),  steroid-
induced rosacea, and perioral dermatitis
are now considered to be different enti-
ties and are no longer classified as sub-
types of rosacea.

Granulomatous  Rosacea The  granuloma-
tous  variant  of  rosacea  is  characterized
by yellow-brown firm papules and nod-
ules  usually  on  the  periorificial  and
malar  areas  of  the  face.22 The  papules
and  nodules  appear  to  be  less  inflamed
than in the papulopustular subtype. The
presence of other subtypes is not neces-
sary for diagnosis of this variant.

Differential Diagnosis

Facial erythema and flushing are seen in
many dermatologic and systemic disor-
ders.  A  clinical  history  and  physical
examination are very important aspects
of the patient evaluation. The Baumann
Skin  Type  Indicator  (BSTI)  can  help
determine patients at risk for developing
rosacea by asking them historical ques-
tions about facial flushing (see Chapter 9).
Laboratory tests may be needed to rule
out  systemic  diseases,  such  as  collagen
vascular  disorders,  if  these  are  sus-
pected.  Table  16-3 lists  the  differential
diagnosis of rosacea.26

TREATMENT

The first step in the treatment of rosacea
is  to  determine  the  subtype.  All  sub-
types  share  one  common  feature—
inflammation.  Therefore,  anti-inflam-
matory  supplements  and  skin  care
products  can  help  this  condition  (see

have  some  cutaneous  manifestation  of

ance are very important aspects of con-

the  facial  sensitivity  of  these  patients,
selecting  the  right  sunscreen  may  be
challenging. Physical blockers (e.g., zinc
oxide and titanium dioxide) are usually

Green-tinted  moisturizers/sunscreens
can  conceal  facial  erythema  and  are
therefore favored by many patients with
rosacea.  Avoidance  of  aggravating  fac-
tors also plays an important role in treat-
ing  this  anxiety-producing  condition
(Table  16-4).  Based  on  the  severity  of

antibiotics  may  be  used.  Although
antibiotic  therapy  controls  the  inflam-
matory component of rosacea, and may
prevent  its  exacerbation,  antibiotics  do
not improve the telangiectatic lesions on
the face. In recent years, light and laser
treatments  have  been  widely  and  suc-
cessfully  used  for  this  purpose.  In  a
study  of  60  patients  affected  with
rosacea  who  were  treated  with  intense
pulsed  light  (IPL),  there  was  a  mean
clearance  of  almost  78%  of  the  telang-
iectasias. In this study, the mean number
of  treatments  was  about  four  and  the
wavelength, pulse duration, and energy
were  adjusted  according  to  patients’
skin  color.27 Pulsed  dye  laser  (PDL)  is
another  alternative.  It  is  reasonable  to
consider  an  initial  treatment  plan  with
IPL  and  later,  treat  the  resistant  telang-
iectatic  areas  with  PDL.  Vascular  laser
treatments will be discussed in detail in

SUMMARY

The  complex  etiology  and  wide  spec-
trum  clinical  manifestations  of  rosacea
render  it  a  challenging  condition  for
both  dermatologists  and  patients.
There 
is  no  single  and  universal
approach  to  treating  the  patients
affected  by  this  condition.  However,
diagnosing rosacea early in the flushing
stage and treating with anti-inflamma-
tory  modalities  may  prevent  its  pro-
gression.  Treatment  regimens  should
individualized  and  tailored  to
be 
address patients’ concerns.

Burning and Stinging
Skin (Type 3
Sensitive Skin)

Leslie Baumann, MD

A  subset  of  people  feel  stinging  and
burning  when  exposed  to  certain  skin
care  products.  These  people  have  tradi-
tionally  been  called  “stingers”  since
Kligman  coined  the  term  in  1977.  This
skin  type  has  also  been  called  reactive
skin, hyperreactive skin, intolerant skin,
or  irritable  skin.  In  the  Baumann  Skin
Typing  System,  stingers  are  designated
as having Baumann S3 sensitive skin (see
Chapter 9); the “3” denotes burners and
stingers rather than other types of sensi-
tive skin that develop such as acne (S1),
rosacea  (S2),  or  contact  dermatitis  (S4).
One patient can demonstrate one to four
different  types  of  sensitive  skin.  For
example, many rosacea (S2) patients are
also burners and stingers (S3). Although
this skin type is referred to as stingers in
the context of applying chemical factors
such  as  skin  care  ingredients,  this  skin
type  also  includes  those  who  feel  the
onset of a prickling, tingling sensation, or
slight  pain  because  of  physical  factors
such  as  ultraviolet  radiation,  heat,  cold,
and  wind.  Psychologic  stress  or  hor-
monal factors such as menstruation may
play  a  role  as  well.  It  is  important  to
know a patient’s susceptibility to S3 sen-
sitive skin because this may lead to non-
compliance  with  certain  medications
and vehicles that cause discomfort to the
patient.  Finacea  is  an  example  of  a
rosacea  medication  that  causes  stinging
in  a  small  proportion  of  users.  Retin  A
Micro contains benzyl alcohol (a deriva-
tive of benzoic acid) that can cause sting-
ing  in  certain  people.  This  chapter  will
discuss what is known about the mecha-
nisms  of  burning  and  stinging,  what
ingredients  are  most  likely  to  cause  it,
and how to identify a potential “stinger.”

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Type 3 sensitive skin is common world-
wide. In a British study, 57% of women
and  31.4%  of  men  reported  that  they
had experienced an adverse reaction to a
personal skin care product at some stage

in their lives, with 23% of women and
13.8% of men having had a problem in
the  last  12  months.1 Another  study
demonstrated  that  women  showed  a
greater  tendency  toward  being  more
sensitive to the subjective effects elicited
by lactic acid than males.2

MECHANISMS OF BURNING 
AND STINGING

Stinging is a problem reported to occur
primarily on the face, particularly on the
nasolabial 
folds  and  cheeks.  The
extreme  sensitivity  of  this  region  is
thought to be caused by a more perme-
able horny layer, a high density of sweat
glands  and  hair  follicles,  and  an  elabo-
rate  network  of  sensory  nerves.3 There
is  specificity  of  the  stinging  response
that  is  not  understood.  In  other  words,
an  individual  may  be  a  lactic  acid
stinger, but not experience such a reac-
tion to other ingredients such as benzoic
acid and azelaic acid. One study showed
that  there  was  no  correlation  between
patients who stung from lactic acid and
those who stung from azelaic acid.4 This
suggests that there is some sort of speci-
ficity  involved  that  has  not  yet  been
deciphered.

The Role of the Sensory Nervous
System

It is likely that the sensory system in the
epidermis  is  involved  in  this  process,
rather  than  the  dermal  sensory  system.
In  the  epidermis,  sensory  nerves  are
linked  to  keratinocytes,  melanocytes,
Langerhans  cells,  and  Merkel  cells  (Box
17-1).  Sensory  nerves  are  categorized
into two groups: the epidermal and the
dermal sensory organs. It is the epider-
mally-located  Merkel  cells  that  are
thought to play a role in sensory percep-
tion; however, the exact role of Merkel
cells  and  their  possible  involvement  in
mechanosensation  is  unclear.5 Merkel
cells  consist  of  neurosecretory  granules
that contain neurotransmitter-type sub-
stances such as metenkephalin, vasoac-
tive  intestinal  peptide,  neuron-specific
enolase,  and  synaptophysin.6 The
Merkel  cell-nerve  complex  has  been
called  by  other  names  including  touch
domes,  hederiform  endings,  Iggo’s  cap-
sule, Pinkus corpuscles, and Haarsheibe.
Merkel cell-nerve complexes have been
found to be associated with hair follicles
and eccrine sweat ducts. Little is known

about  the  effects  of  chemical  agents
upon  the  excitability  of  sensory  units
such as Merkel cells.

It  is  believed  that  those  with  a
predilection  toward  stinging  have  an
increased nerve response. Capsaicin, the
irritant  ingredient  found  in  red  pepper
and  used  commercially  as  “pepper
spray,” causes pain and burning on skin
contact  on  all  subjects.  Its  mechanisms
of action have been studied in the pur-
suit  of  a  better  understanding  of
chemogenic  pain.  Although  it  is  not
known  if  these  same  pathways  play  a
role in the skin burning that patients feel
when they apply skin care products, it is
possible  that  these  follow  a  similar
mechanism;  therefore,  the  actions  of
capsaicin  will  be  explored  here.  The  C
polymodal  nociceptor  is  stimulated  by
capsaicin  and  other  chemicals.  The
effects  of  capsaicin  are  dependent  on
concentration.  Topical  application  of
1%  capsaicin  on  intact  skin  typically
produces sensitization to heat.7 Findings
of  differential  capsaicin  effects  on  heat
perception  and  mechanical  stimuli  per-
ception have led to the belief in the exis-
tence  of  two  categories  of  functionally
different  nociceptors  in  human  skin.8
Much  more  research  needs  to  be  con-
ducted in this area; however, it is plausi-
ble  that  the  heat-sensitive  nociceptors
play  a  role  in  this  stinging  and  burning
skin type.

BOX 17-1 Sensory Nerves in the Skin

The superﬁcial skin layer includes sensory
nerve ﬁbers connected to specialized
receptors such as Merkel cells.

Three types of ﬁbers are generally recog-
nized in the sensory subclass of ﬁbers:
• Beta ﬁbers, which are the largest ﬁbers

and myelinated, mediate the touch, vibra-
tion, and pressure sensations (conduction
velocity of 2–30 m s(cid:4)1).

• Delta ﬁbers, smaller and myelinated,
mediate the cold and pain sensations
(conduction velocity of (cid:5)30 m s(cid:4)1).
• C ﬁbers, the slowest, smaller and non-

myelinated, mediate the warm and itching
sensations (conduction velocity of 
(cid:6)2 m s(cid:4)1). C ﬁbers mediate most of the
autonomic peripheral functions.

fibers likely play a role because they are
known  to  mediate  warm  sensations.
Although the stinging and burning that
characterize  this  skin  type  are  not
always  associated  with  inflammation,
inflammation  may  occur  as  well.
Neurogenic  inflammation  may  result
from neuromediators such as substance P,
calcitonin  gene-related  peptide  (CGRP),
and  vasoactive  intestinal  peptide,  lead-
ing  to  vasodilatation  and  mast  cell
degranulation.9 Nonspecific  inflamma-
tion  may  also  be  associated  with  the
release  of  IL-1,  IL-8,  PgE2,  PgF2,  and
TNF.10 Sorbic  acid,  a  known  cause  of
skin stinging, has been found to release
prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) from a cellular
source in the skin resulting in cutaneous
vasodilatation.11

Itching seems to be a different process
than burning or stinging; however, there
may be some overlap. A detailed expla-
nation of itching is beyond the scope of
this  chapter  but  a  good  recent  review
can  be  found  in  the  study  by  Steinhoff 
et  al.12 An  itch  response  can  be  experi-
mentally induced by topical or intrader-
mal  injections  of  various  substances
such  as  proteolytic  enzymes,  mast  cell
degranulators,  and  vasoactive  agents.
Grove  compared  the  cumulative  lactic
acid sting scores with the histamine itch
scores  in  32  young  subjects;  all  the
subjects  who  were  stingers  were  also
moderate  to  intense  itchers,  whereas
50%  of  the  moderate  itchers  experi-
enced no stinging.13 Recent studies sug-
gest that a new class of C fibers with an
exceptionally lower conduction velocity
and  insensitivity  to  mechanical  stimuli
likely can be considered as afferent units
that mediate the itchy sensation.14

The Skin Barrier and Stinging

The skin barrier plays an important role
in both keeping water from evaporating
from  the  skin  as  well  as  keeping  out
allergens and irritants (see Chapter 11).
It has been postulated that an impaired
skin  barrier  allows  excessive  penetra-
tion of applied ingredients, which may
lead  to  stinging.  A  recent  study  evalu-
ated  298  women  with  5%  lactic  acid
solution  and  measured  transepidermal
water loss, skin hydration, sebum con-
tent,  and  pH.15 A  positive  correlation
between 
increased
transepidermal  water  loss  was  found,
suggesting that skin barrier perturbation
played  a  role  in  the  development  of
stinging.  No  correlation  was  observed
between  stinging  responses  and  other
parameters  such  as  skin  hydration,
sebum content, or pH. However, not all

stinging 

and 

studies show stingers to have impaired
barriers. One study examining the rela-
tionship between stingers (Baumann S3
type) and those who develop an irritant
reaction to a 0.3% sodium dodecyl sul-
fate patch test (Baumann S4 type) found
that  stingers  were  no  more  likely  to
develop  an  irritant  response  than  non-
stingers.3

Rosacea and Skin Stinging

Patients with rosacea (Baumann S2 type)
have a tendency to flush. This flushing is
often  accompanied  by  a  warm  sensa-
tion. Many rosacea patients also complain
of intolerance to skin care products. One
study  examined 
relationship.
Thirty-two patients with rosacea and 32
controls were given the lactic acid sting-
ing  test.  Twenty-four  patients  and  six
controls  reacted  positively  as  stingers 
(p (cid:6) 0.001).  This  study  suggests  that
patients  with  rosacea  may  be  more
likely to be stingers.16

this 

ETHNICITY AND STINGING

Although  there  is  a  clinical  consensus
that  blacks  are  less  reactive  and  Asians
are more reactive than whites, the data
supporting  this  hypothesis  rarely  reach
statistical significance.17 Frosch reported
that  most  common  stingers  were  light-
complexioned persons of Celtic ancestry
who  sunburned  easily  and  tanned
poorly.18 Grove et al. found that stinging
was  not  related  to  ethnicity,  but  was
associated  mainly  with  a  person’s  his-
tory  of  sensitivity  to  soaps,  cosmetics,
and drugs.19 Aramaki et al. found signif-
icant  subjective  sensory  differences
between Japanese and German women
even though they had significant differ-
ences in reactions to sodium lauryl sulfate
testing.20 They concluded that Japanese
women  might  be  more  likely  to  report
stronger stinging sensations, reflecting a
different  cultural  behavior.  Large-scale
studies of ethnic differences in this skin
type have not been performed.

INGREDIENTS THAT CAUSE  
STINGING

A list of common stinging ingredients is
found  in  Table  17-1.  However,  new
ingredients  are  being  developed  every
day  so  it  is  impossible  to  have  a  com-
plete  list.  Patients  with  a  proclivity  to
experience stinging should be advised to
make  a  list  of  the  ingredients  found  in
the  stinging
products

the  patient  identify  the  responsible
ingredient(s) to be avoided in the future.
As  a  general  rule,  products  with  a  low
pH such as any acids (e.g., glycolic, sali-
cylic, lactic) will cause stinging. Vitamin
C  is  formulated  with  a  low  pH  to
enhance absorption, so some forms may
cause stinging. In addition, alcohols that
are often found in toners and astringents
can cause stinging.

HOW TO IDENTIFY A POTENTIAL 
STINGER

The  Baumann  Skin  Type  Indicator
(BSTI) contains a series of questions that
are  designed  to  identify  those  with  the
Baumann  S3  skin  type  (see  Chapter  9).
This  questionnaire  can  be  accessed
online  by  registering  at  www.SkinIQ.
com.  Using  the  online  version  of  the
questionnaire will allow data to be col-
lected in order to examine issues such as
the role of gender, ethnicity, and climate
on skin stinging. It is imperative to col-
lect large amounts of worldwide data to
identify  the  factors  relevant  in  this
condition.

Objective  measures  in  the  research
and  clinical  setting  may  be  used  to
identify stingers. However, it is impor-
tant to note that not all stingers react to
all  known  stinging  agents.  In  spite  of
this,  clinical  tests  can  give  insight  into
this  distressing  condition.  The  lactic
acid stinging test was first described by
Kligman in 1977.18 This method is now
used  with  various  stinging  agents
besides lactic acid. The agent of choice
is  applied  to  the  cheek  using  a  cotton
swab. The stingers experience a moder-
ate  to  severe  sensation  within  a  few

minutes. These subjects are then asked
to  describe  the  intensity  of  the  sensa-
tion using a point scale.21 It is important
to  note  that  substances  cannot  be
simultaneously  tested  on  both  cheeks.
Strong  stinging  on  one  side  may
enhance  the  perception  of  stinging  on
the opposite cheek. In a laboratory set-
ting,  stingers  are  easy  to  identify.  The
problem  is  that  not  all  people  sting  in
response  to  the  same  substance.  For
example, a lactic acid stinger may sting
to  lactic  acid  but  not  to  benzoic  acid.
For  this  reason,  it  is  very  difficult  to
predict  outside  the  laboratory  setting
which  ingredients  will  make  a  patient
sting.  The  BSTI  can  help  identify  sus-
ceptible  subpopulations  who  are  more
likely  to  develop  a  stinging  response
based on historical data.

SUMMARY

Baumann  S3  sensitive  skin  is  a  poorly
understood  skin  type.  Those  who
exhibit  such  a  skin  type  find  that  they
are  intolerant  to  some  skin  care  prod-
ucts. This likely affects their brand and
product choices. Although stinging skin
is  usually  not  accompanied  by  inflam-
mation, it can be very uncomfortable for
the  patient  and  can  lead  to  noncompli-
ance  with  skin  care  regimens  for  other
conditions. More research is needed into
the mechanisms and associations of this
intellectually intriguing skin type so that
treatment  options  can  be  improved
and/or  expanded  for  the  patients  who
suffer  symptoms  because  of  this  sub-
type of sensitive skin.

HOW TO PREVENT STINGING

REFERENCES

At  this  point,  identification  and  avoid-
ance of agents that cause stinging is the
most prudent approach. Patients should
be  instructed  to  keep  a  list  of  ingredi-
ents  that  cause  stinging  and  avoid
agents  that  contain  such  components.
This  includes  shampoos,  conditioners,
and  shaving  products  as  well  as  skin
care products. It is likely that improving
the  skin  barrier  will  decrease  the  inci-
dence  of  the  stinging  response.  Anti-
inflammatory products such as antioxi-
dants,  aloe  vera,  and  chamomile  can
help  decrease  inflammation  that  may
coincide with the stinging response. It is
important  to  remember  that  stinging
not  accompanied  by  inflammation  is
not necessarily detrimental to the skin.
In  fact,  chemical  peel  agents,  glycolic
acid, and lactic acid agents cause sting-
ing  in  many  because  of  their  low  pH.
However,  these  agents  have  been
shown  to  be  very  useful  in  increasing
skin  hydration  and  improving  the
appearance of photodamaged skin.

Contact Dermatitis
(Type 4 Sensitive Skin)

Sharon E. Jacob, MD

OVERVIEW OF CONTACT 
DERMATITIS

Contact dermatitis is an umbrella expres-
sion for a group of dermatoses that are ini-
tiated by the pivotal event of the epider-
mis coming into contact with a triggering
chemical. For practical purposes, there are
three main clinical forms: (1) irritant con-
tact dermatitis (ICD); (2) contact urticaria
(CU);  and  (3)  allergic  contact  dermatitis
(ACD).  Approximately  80%  of  contact
dermatitis  cases  are  identified  as  ICD,
because  ICD  represents  a  nonspecific
inflammatory  response  to  a  chemical
when the skin barrier function is impaired.
Wet  work  (immersing  in  detergents,
water, or other activities that require fre-
quent hand washing) predisposes an indi-
vidual  to  these  irritant-type  reactions
because of disruptions in skin barrier func-
tion  (see  Chapter  11).  Irritancy  can  also
occur  after  chronic  exposure  to  an  envi-
ronment  with  low  humidity,1 or  chronic
exposure to saliva (lip smacking), urine, or
feces.  Another  example  of  an  inducible
ICD  is  epidermal  keratinocyte  damage
following a cosmetic peel (Fig. 18-1).

At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum  is
CU, which accounts for approximately
0.5%  of  the  contact  dermatitides.  This
type  of  reaction  is  IgE-mediated  and
represents  an  immediate-type  hyper-
sensitivity  response.  Clinically,  CU
manifests  classic  wheals  and  flares
(hives);  with  extreme  cases  the  clinical
symptoms may progress to severe respi-
ratory  compromise,  anaphylaxis,  and
death.  A  primary  example  is  latex
hypersensitivity.

The  pathophysiology  of  ACD  is
remarkably  different  from  the  other
types  of  contact  dermatitis.  Like  CU,
ACD is an immunologic reaction; how-
ever, unlike CU, ACD is a consequence
of lymphocyte activation (a T-cell medi-
ated  Type  IV  delayed-type  hypersensi-
tivity [DTH] reaction). To assist with the
visualization of the sensitization process,
it can be useful to consider the triggering
of  ACD  as  similar  to  serial  vaccination,
although scientifically it is important to
note that they are different immunologic

processes. That is, with each subsequent
dose of a chemical the ability to remem-
ber that chemical for future interactions
becomes more likely. For example, with
the  hepatitis  B  vaccine,  three  shots  are
required for establishing long-lasting and
effective “immunity,” or memory of that
chemical;  conversely,  a  tetanus  vaccine
must be “boosted” to guarantee memory.
Like the tetanus, the more potent chemi-
cals may only require a single dose, such
as  poison  ivy.  In  most  cases  of  ACD,
however, the “shots” are mini-doses that
taken sequentially over a given period of
time result in the individual being sensi-
tized to that chemical.

STEPS LEADING TO ALLERGIC
CONTACT DERMATITIS

The  chemicals  likely  to  elicit  an  ACD
are  generally  small  lipophilic  com-
pounds  to  which  an  individual  is 

routinely  exposed.  These  chemicals
usually  have  a  molecular  weight  less
than 500 Da allowing them to penetrate
the  skin  or  mucous  membranes  and
activate  an  immunologic  cascade.2,3
Subsequent to entry into the skin these
chemicals  are  taken  up  by  epidermal
immunologic  cells  (Langerhans  cells)
and  further  processed  for  presentation
to naïve T lymphocytes. This process of
chemical  capture  and  presentation  is
known as the induction phase of sensi-
tization.

With induction there is clonal expan-
sion of memory T cells, each inheriting
the  capability  to  mount  an  immune
response  upon  reexposure  to  the  aller-
genic  chemical.  Upon  reexposure,  or
challenge, the elicitation phase of sensi-
tization ensues, which involves a com-
plex  interplay  between  immune  cells
(i.e.,  Langerhans,  lymphocytes,  and
keratinocytes).  Each  cell  releases  its
respective  cytokine  repertoire  leading

 
 
 
to  the  clinical  picture  of  ACD.  It  is
important to note that while the initial
sensitization process may take up to 21
days,  subsequent  reexposure  of  the
sensitized  individual  may  result  in  a
rechallenge  reaction  within  48  to  120
hours.2

For the most part, primary allergic con-
tact  type  lesions  present  in  the  distribu-
tion  of  allergen—epidermal  contact,
which ultimately provides a very impor-
tant diagnostic clue as to the identity of
the  culprit  chemical  allergen.  There  is  a
notable exception to this rule, however—
the  “recall  reaction.”  In  the  recall  reac-
tion, sites of previous sensitization may
be  remotely  activated  when  contact
with the chemical is initiated at a distant
site.  The  confounding  factors  of  delay
and recall pose a unique challenge in the
diagnosis  of  ACD.  For  example,  one
might not suspect the sensitizing role of
the  hair  dye  paraphenylenediamine
when  a  patient  develops  a  subsequent
reaction  to  an  ester-based  topical  anes-
thetic (both are para-aminobenzoic acid
derivatives)4 (Fig. 18-2).

CLINICAL PICTURE OF 
ALLERGIC CONTACT 
DERMATITIS

While in ACD the primary clinical der-
matitis  usually  occurs  in  the  distribu-
tion of the contact with the instigating
allergen,  there  are  inherent  differences
in  the  area  of  the  involved  epidermis,
the  potency  of  the  allergen,  and  the
duration  of  the  dermatitis  that  may
alter the presentation.4 Classic localiza-
tions  for  cosmetic  contact  allergy  are
the face, neck, hands, and axillae relat-
ing to the use of fragrance-based prod-
ucts 
(Fig.  18-3).
Flavorings such as peppermint or cinna-
mon can lead to skin reactions as well
and  often  present  as  a  dermatitis
around  the  mouth  known  as  perioral
dermatitis  (Fig.  18-4). In  some  cases,
“consort”  or  “connubial”  contact  der-
matitis  occurs  when  the  contact  der-
matitis is caused by contact with prod-
ucts used by partners or coworkers.

COSMETIC IMPLICATIONS OF
CONTACT DERMATITIS

compromised  by  an  ensuing  irritant 

or  allergic-based  contact  dermatitis.
Furthermore, failure to effectively detect
and  avoid  subsequent  exposures  to  the
allergen may result in unmitigating der-
matitis,  which  may  have  a  seemingly
poor  correlation  with  the  current  per-
sonal regimen of the patient. For exam-

ACD can be classified into three main
categories: subacute, acute, and chronic
subtypes.6 In  subacute  presentations,
clinically  the  skin  exhibits  macular
erythema and scaling. The acute presen-
tation typically displays pruritic erythe-
matous,  edematous,  and  papulovesicu-
lar  changes  in  the  skin.  When  the
dermatitis is chronic, however, the clini-
cal presentation involves lichenification
and  fissuring  and  may  not  be  distin-

(cid:2) FIGURE 18-3 Contact dermatitis to fragrance presenting on eyelids.

It should be noted that irritant-based
reactions  may  also  be  seen  at  the 
48-hour  reading.  However,  unlike  the
ACD-type  reactions,  these  tend  to 
be resolving at the delayed reading. The
sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) test may be a
useful adjuvant patch test, especially in
the sensitive skin patient, as it may facil-
itate the differentiation between allergic
and irritant reactions.9 A reaction in the
SLS application patch during patch test-
ing  indicates  that  macular  erythema  in
the  patch  test  sample  on  that  patient
more  likely  reflects  an  irritant  etiology.
Conversely,  if  the  SLS  test  fails  to
demonstrate a reaction upon patch test-
ing, it is more likely that macular erythe-
matous  reactions  may  be  allergic  in
nature.  While  the  SLS  testing  may  be
useful, it is important to note that clini-
cal  correlation  of  the  presentation  and
exposure history are crucial for the cor-
rect  diagnosis  of  allergic  versus  irritant
contact dermatitis.

ral dermatitis, which is a variant of contact dermatitis. In this ﬁgure, the patient’s dermatitis was caused

an  attempt  to  avoid  fragrances,  turn  to
“fragrance-free” products, which notably
may  contain  the  fragrance  benzyl  alco-
hol.  Indeed,  fragrance-based  chemicals
may  be  added  to  products  labeled  as
“fragrance-free”  if  they  are  included  for
an  indication  other  than  as  a  fragrance.
Benzyl  alcohol  has  a  preservative  func-
tion as well as a fragrance function and
can  therefore  be  found  in  “fragrance-
free”  products.  In  this  example,  the
patient using a benzyl alcohol-containing
“fragrance-free”  product  could  end  up
with recall-type reactions in the distribu-
tions  of  other  fragrance  sensitivity
responses. This may occur in addition to
or  without  a  subsequent  dermatitis  in
the  area  of  the  new  “fragrance-free”
product.  Obviously,  a  diagnosis  in  this
case would be difficult to achieve.

As with any ACD, factors to consider
in attempting to correlate exposure with
reactions  and  control  future  outbreaks
are (1) the number and duration of expo-
sures to the same chemical (even if it is
in  a  different  product  composition); 
(2)  status  of  the  skin  barrier;  (3)  occlu-
sion; and (4) the amount (dose) per unit
area of skin exposed.2

DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATIONS

The  epicutaneous  patch  test  is  the  gold
standard testing  tool  in  the  diagnosis  of
ACD. There are two commercially avail-
able  patch  test  screening tools  in  the
United  States  with  Food  and  Drug
Administration  (FDA)  indications:  the
Hermal/Trolab  20  allergen  standard  test
and the 24-chamber Thin-layer Rapid Use
Epicutaneous  (T.R.U.E.)  test.7,8 Beyond
these standard assessment tools, compre-
hensive testing may be performed by tai-
loring the selection of various fragrances,
cosmetics, vehicles, and preservatives for
the patient based on the history and clini-
cal distribution of the dermatitis.

In  comprehensive  testing,  suspect
chemical  substances  are,  per  standard
procedure,  hand-loaded  in  chambers
and placed in contact with the clinically
unaffected  epidermis  of  the  back  and
inner  arm  for  48  hours  (Figs.  18-5  and
18-6). These patches are then removed,
marked,  and  evaluated  after  the  initial
48-hour  application  period.  The  patch
sites are assessed at both 48 hours and at
a  delayed  reading  between  72  and  120
hours  postapplication.  ACD-type  reac-
tions  typically  will  be  evolving  and
worsening  at  the  delayed  reading.
Reactions  are  graded  per  the  North
American  Contact  Dermatitis  protocol
from 0 to 3(cid:3) and irritant.

A  full  discussion  of  the  wide  range  of
sensitizing chemicals found in cosmetic-
based  products  is  beyond  the  scope  of
this chapter, but a list of the most com-
mon  allergens  is  found  in  Table  18-1.
Two categories deserve special attention,
however, with regard to cosmetic-based
contact  allergies,  most  notably  fra-
grances and preservatives.

Fragrances (Table 18-2.)

Since  the  first  report  of  allergy  to
fragrance-based  chemicals  in  1957,  fra-
grances have continued to remain on the
top  10  allergen  list  for  contact  sensitiza-
tion.10 In  fact,  fragrances  are  the  second
most  common  allergen  family  identified
to  cause  ACD,  and  notably  the  most
frequent  cause  of  contact  allergy  to
cosmetics. Specifically, cosmetics account
for 30% to 45% of these allergic contact
reactions,  while  perfumes  and  deodor-
ants/antiperspirants  account  for  4%  to
18%  and  5%  to  17%  of  cases,  respec-
tively.5 In  addition,  most  likely  due  to
exposure habits, fragrance allergy tends
to  occur  more  frequently  in  women,
with a female to male ratio of 3.5:1.11,12
Detection of fragrance allergy may be
quite complex as, for example, an aver-
age  of  30  to  50  (and  upward  of  200)
chemicals  may  be  used  to  create  a
fragrance  composition!13

[tree  lichen],  hydroxycitronellal  [syn-
thetic],  and  (cid:7)-amyl  cinnamic  aldehyde
[synthetic])  as  a  screening  tool  for  fra-
grance  contact  allergy.3,14 This  tool,
Fragrance Mix 1, is now used in both the
commercially  available  FDA-approved
Thin-layer  Rapid  Use  Epicutaneous
(T.R.U.E.)  screening  panel  and  in  com-
prehensive  testing  to  screen  for  fra-
grance  allergy  and  in  conjunction  with
balsam of Peru. Notably, these two com-
ponents  are  thought  to  detect  approxi-
mately 90% of fragrance allergies.15

With  regard  to  the  chemicals  that
comprise  the  remaining  10%,  several
fragrance  allergens  (either  essential  oils
or  synthetics)  account  for  the  majority
of reactions. This underscores the need
for awareness of “natural”- or “herbal”-
based  chemicals  as  potential  sources  of
ACD. Table 18-2 provides a compilation
of  estimated  sensitization  rates  from
several  sources.  Of  note,  patients  may
be allergic to more than one, and several
cross-react.

It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the
top four sensitizers of the eight ingredi-
ents in the Fragrance Mix 1 are also nat-
ural  cross-sensitizers/components  of
balsam  of  Peru.3 Balsam  of  Peru  is  a
dark  brown,  complex  viscid  fluid  har-
vested from the mature Myroxylon bal-
samum tree  primarily  found  in  El
Salvador, which was a Peruvian colony
when  the  compound  was  discovered.
The balsam contains the volatile oil cin-
namein,  a  combination  of  cinnamic
acid, benzoyl cinnamate, benzoyl ben-
zoate,  benzoic  acid,  vanillin,  and
nerodilol, all of which have wide utility
in  the  pharmaceutical,  cosmetic,  and
flavoring industries.16 In 2005, cinnamic
alcohol was found to naturally occur in
both tomatoes and balsam of Peru, pro-
viding  proof  to  support  the  common
claim  that  tomatoes  were  a  trigger  in
patients  with  a  known  allergy  to  bal-
sam  of  Peru.17 Because  it  confers  mild
bactericidal and capillary-bed stimulant
effects, balsam of Peru is widely used in
topical  medicines  for  wounds,  burns,
hemorrhoids,  and  diaper 
salves.
Furthermore,  balsam  of  Peru  compo-
nents, such as benzyl alcohol, are used
widely  in  cosmetics  (i.e.,  BOTOX™-
reconstituted)  for  its  mild  anesthetic
and preservative properties.

Medical  providers  should  be  cognizant
of the use of these covert fragrance chemi-
cals. The FDA code of federal regulations,
title 21, volume 7, section 700.3 (d), states
that the term “fragrance” applies to any nat-
ural  or  synthetic  substance  or  substances
used solely to impart an odor to a cosmetic

reportedly  used  in  the  global  fragrance
and flavor market (see Chapter 36). This
estimated  US$12  to  15  billion  per  year
industry  provides  such  chemicals  for  a
wide  variety  of  products  from  eau  de
toilettes/colognes  and  cosmetics  to
cleaning  supplies  and  medicaments  to
foods  and  flavored  personal  hygiene
products.5,12

Increasing rates of sensitization, how-
ever,  have  prompted  calls  for  fragrance
identification  measures  to  be  estab-
lished. In 1977, Larsen proposed a mix-
ture  of  eight  ingredients  (isoeugenol,
eugenol,  cinnamic  aldehyde,  cinnamic
alcohol  [also  called  cassia  oil],  geraniol
[base  substance  of  the  essential  oils:

METHYLDIBROMO  GLUTARONITRILE  AND
PHENOXYETHANOL  (EUXYL  K400) Methyl-
dibromo  glutaronitrile  (MDGN),  first
introduced in the cosmeceutical industry
in 1985, is a preservative used in a wide
variety of toiletry and industrial products.
Of note, contact allergy to this chemical
is markedly on the rise, with this preserv-
ative ranking second only to FRPs (Table
18-3). Initially,  the  maximum  allowable
concentration was 0.1% in both leave-on
and rinse-off cosmetic products, with one
exception—sunscreens,  for  which  the
maximum  allowable  concentration  was
0.025%.22 However,  by  compounding
the  MDGN  with  phenoxylethanol  in  a
ratio of 1:4 (Euxyl K400, Schulke & Mayr
Inc., Hamburg, Germany), the manufac-
turer was able to make a highly effective
and  stable  preservative  at  even  lower
concentrations  (0.05%–0.02%  depend-
ing on the product).3 A higher concentra-
tion  would  be  more  likely  to  cause
sensitization.

Contact  sensitization  to  Euxyl  K400
does  occur,  however,  and  is  usually  due 
to  the  MDGN  component.  Allergy  to
MDGN has been reported in association
with  the  use  of  makeup  removal  wipes,
moistened  toilet  tissue,  cucumber  eye
gel,  barrier  creams,  ultrasonic  gel,  and
makeups.23,24 High sensitization rates led
the  European  Commission  for  Cosmetic
Products to recommend a ban on the use
of  MDGN  in  leave-on  products  in  2003
and,  likewise,  in  2005  recommend  that
rinse-off
MDGN  be  banned 
products.25,26 Products  containing  these
preservatives  are  still  used  in  the  United
States  and  the  provider  and  consumer
should  be  aware  of  the  potential  for
sensitization.

METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE 
AND
METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE  (EUXYL  K100) In
1977, methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI,
5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one)
and methylisothiazolinone (MI, 2-methyl-
4-isothiazolin-3-one) were first registered
in  the  United  States  as  Kathon  CG  and
Euxyl K100.27 These two chemical preser-
vatives  are  combined  in  a  ratio  of  3:1
(MCI:MI)  and  have  been  extensively
added  to  bubble  bath  preparations,  cos-
metics,  and  soaps.28,29 Because  of  their
chemical nature of having polarity (being
lipophilic at one end and lipophobic at the
other), MCI and MI are compatible with a
large  number  of  surfactants  and  emulsi-
fiers.  Furthermore,  the  isothiazolinones
are biocidal, as they interact and oxidize
accessible cellular thiols on microbials.30

In  a  multicenter  study  including  15
different  countries,  MCI  was  identified
as  the  culprit  contact  allergen  in  2.9%

product.18 By this definition, a product can
be labeled as “fragrance-free” if fragrance-
based ingredients are added to serve a pur-
pose  other  than  affecting  the  odor  of  a
product, such as for preservation.19

Consumers and providers alike should
also be aware that “fragrance-free” is not
synonymous  with  “unscented.”  In  gen-
eral, “fragrance-free” refers to the absence
of  aroma-enhancing  chemicals,  whereas
unscented  may  mean  that  a  fragrance-
masking chemical has been added.

Preservatives (Tables 18-3 and 18-4.)
FORMALDEHYDE  AND  FORMALDEHYDE-
RELEASING  PRESERVATIVES Formaldehyde
and  formaldehyde-releasing  preserva-
tives are second only to fragrances as the
most common sources of cosmetic-asso-
ciated  contact  dermatitis.20 In  order  to
decrease  sensitization  rates  and  ulti-
lower  the  concentration  of
mately 
formaldehyde in products, it is common

for manufacturers to use formaldehyde-
releasing-preservatives  (FRPs)  instead  of
formaldehyde.  Examples  of  FRPs  are
listed  in  Table  18-4. It  is  important  to
note,  however,  that  the  FRPs  are  the
most  sensitizing  of  the  preservative
class.  Cases  of  contact  dermatitis  to
formaldehyde/FRPs  commonly  present
as eyelid dermatitis, which is often asso-
ciated with the use of nail hardeners/lac-
quers/cosmetics  that  contain  formalde-
hydes.  Several  mascaras,  blushes,  eye
shadows,  foundations,  and  shampoos
also contain the FRPs that can contribute
to  the  development  of  eyelid  and  facial
dermatitis  in  the  areas  of  sensitization.
Other  important  potential  sources  of
exposure  to  formaldehyde  and  FRPs
include permanent press clothing, clean-
ing  agents,  baby  wipes,  disinfectants,
cigarette  smoke,  and  the  sweetener
aspartame.21 It  is  worth  noting  that
formaldehyde  is  sometimes  included  in
products touted as “natural.”

76  mg/d  (1.3  mg/kg/d  for  a  person
weighing  70  kg)  with  the  majority 
(50 mg/d) derived from cosmetics and per-
sonal hygiene product exposure. Notably,
food preparations (e.g., mayonnaise, jams,
salad  dressings,  etc.)  are  thought  to
account only for approximately 1 mg/d.33
The  parabens,  when  absorbed
through  the  skin,  are  partially  metabo-
lized  by  carboxyl  esterases  in  the  skin,
liver, and kidney.34 Recently, it has been
demonstrated that a portion of parabens
may be retained in human body tissues
without  hydrolysis  by  tissue  esterases,
which  has  raised  concern  over  the
potential  for  adverse  side  effects.35
Special  regard  has  been  given  to  the
estrogen-like  effects,  which  were  first
described  by  Routledge  et  al.  in  1998
and have been further substantiated by
several studies.36–39

Since estrogen is a major etiologic fac-
tor in the development of human breast
tissue  and  breast  cancers,  Darbre  et  al.
proposed that parabens and other chem-
icals that are used in underarm cosmetics
may have contributed to what was then,
in  2003,  the  increasing  incidence  of
breast cancer.40 In an uncontrolled study
of  20  patients  with  breast  tumors,
parabens  were  found  in  90%  of  the

(Finland),  3.6%  (United  States),  5.7%
(Germany),  and  8.4%  (Italy)  of  the
cases.31 The  rinse-off  products  (i.e.,
shampoos and soaps) were less likely to
provoke  dermatitis  when  compared  to
leave-on  formulations  (i.e.,  moisturizers
and cosmetics). Of note, there may be a
potential  for  MCI  or  MI  to  cross-react
with  metronidazole,  as  the  chemicals
have  similar  molecular  structures.32
Thus, the provider may need to be aware
of this when prescribing formulations for
rosacea, such as Noritate and Metrogel in
an MCI- or MI-allergic patient.

Parabens

The para-hydroxybenzoic acids (parabens)
are a family of five alkyl esters that differ
in  para-position  chemical  composition
substitutions on the benzene ring (methyl
paraben,  ethyl  paraben,  propyl  paraben,
butyl  paraben,  and  benzyl  paraben).
These  chemical  substitutions  impart  on
each  paraben  ester  a  different  solubility
and  antimicrobial  activity  spectrum.
Frequently, manufacturers take advantage
of this and use the parabens in conjunc-
tion  with  each  other  to  enhance  antimi-
crobial efficacy.33 In the United States, the
average  total  paraben  exposure  per  indi-
vidual  is  estimated  to  be  approximately

been suggested that there may have been
“contamination”  of  the  glassware  that
the samples were processed in from the
detergents used by the technicians.37,41

The  close  proximity  of  the  axilla  and
the breast has further fueled queries as to
the  possibility  of  an  association  of
parabens with breast cancer.42 This led the
Cosmetic  Ingredient  Review  Board  to
reevaluate  the  safety  of  parabens  in
2005.43 The  panel  determined  that  the
original  conclusion  on  the  safety  of
parabens in cosmetics withstood, and that
parabens were shown to have much less
estrogenic  activity  than  the  body’s  natu-
rally-occurring  estrogen.44 Nevertheless,

term  exposure  to  low  levels  of  parabens
and subsequent accumulation in the body

tissues  suggests  the  need  for  prospective

With  regard  to  topical  adverse  effects
from  cosmetic  preparations,  the  parabens
have caused both irritant and allergic type
contact  dermatitis.45–48 For  example,
paraben allergy has been described in asso-
ciation  with  facial  cosmetics,  ultrasound
gels,  topical  steroid  creams,  and  food
additives.49–52 A  recent  meta-analysis  by
Krob et al. revealed that despite widespread
use  of  this  preservative  class,  the  overall
prevalence and relevance of paraben allergy
was  remarkably  low  (0.5%),  when  com-
pared to other preservative chemicals.53

IODOPROPYNYL  BUTYL  CARBAMATE In
1996,  iodopropynyl  butyl  carbamate
(IPBC)  was  approved  for  use  in  the
United  States  by 
the  Cosmetic
Ingredient  Review  at  an  allowable  level
of  up  to  0.1%  in  topical  formulations.3
in
Testing  for  this  allergen  began 
Denmark  in  1996  and  in  the  United
States in 1998, with current data suggest-
ing that the sensitization potential is rel-
atively low when compared to the other
preservative allergens.54 (See Chapter 37

have  also  been  reported  to  cause  skin
allergy.  In  order  to  elucidate  the  cause
of contact dermatitis in most patients, a
thorough history is crucial. Having the
patients bring in the offending skin care
products,  when  known,  is  also  neces-
sary.

TREATMENT

The  first  step  in  the  treatment  of  any
contact  dermatitis  is  to  identify  the
offending agent, whether an allergen or a
caustic irritating chemical. Once identifi-
cation  has  been  made,  the  subsequent
step  is  avoidance  of  the  culprit  com-
pound and, in the case of ACD, all cross-
reactive substances. Alternative product
substitution is imperative for the well-
being of the patient. Furthermore, mea-
sures  should  be  taken  to  ensure  barrier
integrity  (i.e.,  decreased  hand  washing
with soaps and increased emollient use)
for both allergic- and irritant-based der-
matoses.  The  use  of  emollients  to  help
heal  the  skin  is  important,  especially
with regard to reactions that are irritant
in nature (see Chapter 31).

In  the  interim,  while  the  avoidance
regimen  is  being  instituted  and  the
immune system is being given a chance
to  “forget”  the  sensitization,  sympto-
matic  treatment  in  ACD  and  CU  may
consist of topical corticosteroids or topi-
cal  immunomodulators.  At  times,  with
severe  acute  or  chronic  extensive

involvement, the use of systemic agents
such  as  prednisone,  cyclosporine,  or
ultraviolet light treatments may be indi-
cated. The use of ICD corticosteroids is
controversial, but seems to be advanta-
geous if applied early.

Wrinkled Skin

Sogol Saghari, MD
Leslie Baumann, MD

The  desire  to  maintain  or  restore  a
youthful  appearance  has  become  a  sig-
nificant  concern  for  many  people  in
today’s world. Evidently, “wrinkles” are
considered one of the major obstacles in
this  arena.  In  2004,  Botox  Cosmetic™
injections  were  shown  to  be  the  most
often  performed  cosmetic  procedure  in
the United States.1 Cutaneous wrinkles,
defined as furrows or ridges on the skin
surface,  appear  to  be  multifactorial  in
etiology  and  a  consequence  of  intrinsic
and extrinsic aging (discussed in Chapter
6).  While  genetic  predisposition  is  an
important factor in developing wrinkles,
engaging  in  particular  life  style  behav-
iors such as excessive sun exposure and
smoking are also known causes of cuta-
neous aging (see Chapter 6). This chap-
ter  will  concentrate  on  wrinkles  not
caused  by  sun  exposure  but,  rather,  by
intrinsic  aging.  Treatment  approaches
focus  more  on  the  condition  itself,  but
also  address  behavioral  elements  per-
taining to extrinsic aging.

AGING

Aging  is  a  process  that  occurs  in  all
organs,  but  is  most  visible  in  the  skin.
The skin may very well reflect or act as
an  outward  sign  of  processes  occurring
in  the  internal  organs.  In  fact,  the
amount  of  facial  wrinkling  has  been
shown  to  correlate  with  the  extent  of
lung  disease  in  COPD.2 The  naturally-
occurring  functional  decline  of  organs
with age can be exacerbated by environ-
mental  factors,  but  there  is  certainly  a
genetic  component  that  influences  the
aging  process.  Little  is  known  at  this
point  about  the  genetics  of  skin  aging
except  for  the  genes  that  have  been
implicated  in  premature  aging  syn-
dromes  such  as  Werner’s  syndrome3
(Table  19-1).  Mammalian  cells  can
undergo  only  a  certain  number  of  cell
divisions  before  replicative  senescence
occurs  and  they  are  no  longer  able  to
divide.6 This  may  be  nature’s  way  of
preventing  these  cells  from  becoming
cancerous; however, this process plays a
role in aging as well.

aThese premature aging syndromes suggest that
DNA repair capacity is very important to mitigate
aging.

Pathology and Etiology

The  histopathology  of  wrinkles  is  a
combination  of  interesting  findings.
Epidermal  thinning  is  an  outstanding
microscopic feature, where the atrophy
is more prominent in the deepest area of
the  wrinkle  (Fig.  6-8).  Other  changes
include  flattening  of  the  dermal-epider-
mal  junction,  atrophy  of  the  subcuta-
neous adipose tissue of the hypodermis,
as  well  as  the  loss  of  collagen,  gly-
cosaminoglycans, and elastin tissue.

COLLAGEN  LOSS Abnormal  and  reduced
collagen is a major finding in the pathol-
ogy  of  wrinkles,  both  in  sun-exposed
and  non-sun-exposed  skin.7 Collagen
modification  in  wrinkled  skin  can  be
explained with a combination of differ-
ent concepts. It is well known that colla-
gen synthesis is decreased in aging skin.
In  addition,  because  of  higher  levels  of
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), col-
lagen  degradation  also  appears  to
increase  with  aging.  Another  explana-
tion  for  abnormal  dermal  collagen  in
cutaneous  aging  is  collagen  glycation.8
As discussed in Chapter 2, glycation of
collagen is a nonenzymatic process that
involves the addition of a reducing sugar
molecule to extracellular matrix collagen
and  proteins.  Following  an  oxidative
reaction,  the  end  products  of  glycated
collagen  and  proteins,  known  as
advanced  glycation  end  products
(AGEs), are formed. The AGEs are then
deposited on the collagen and elastin tis-
sue, rendering them stiffer and less sus-
ceptible to contracture and remodeling.
In  addition,  glycated  collagen  modifies
the actin cytoskeleton of fibroblasts and
inhibits  their  contracture  effect  on  the
collagen.9 AGEs  can  interact  with  cer-
tain receptors to induce intracellular sig-
naling that leads to enhanced oxidative
stress and elaboration of key proinflam-
matory  cytokines.  The  resulting  free
radicals  and  cytokines  lead  to  a  break-
down of collagen.10

Decorin, a small leucine-rich proteo-
glycans  (SLRPs)  found  in  the  extracel-
luar matrix protein, is involved in “dec-
orating” the collagen (see Chapter 2). It
is shaped in a “horseshoe” pattern and
holds  collagen  fibers  in  the  proper
arrangement.11 Interestingly,  a  frag-
ment  of  decorin  also  known  as
“decorunt”  has  been  shown  to  be
higher in adult versus fetal skin.12 Since
decorunt has a lower affinity for colla-
gen fibers, the breakdown of decorin to
decorunt may play a role in the disorga-
nization  of  the  dermal  collagen  net-
work seen in aged skin.

ELASTIN  DEGRADATION Wrinkled  skin  is
known  to  exhibit  decreased  resilience
because of abnormal elastic tissue. In the
setting of UV exposure, the quantity of
elastase,  the  enzyme  responsible  for
degrading elastin, increases and leads to
“elastosis,”  a  hallmark  of  photoaged
skin.  However,  studies  have  demon-
strated  that  nonexposed  aged  skin  also
displays less elastin tissue.13,14

the 

TELOMERE  SHORTENING Telomeres  are
the  terminal  portions  of  mammalian
chromosomes  that  are  composed  of
hundreds  of  short  sequences  of  repeats
of  the  base  pairs  TTAGGG.  They  cap
the  ends  of  chromosomes  preventing
fusion.15 During cell division, when the
chromosomes divide, the enzyme DNA
polymerase  cannot  replicate  the  final
base  pairs  of 
chromosome.
Therefore, these terminal sequences are
continuously  lost  on  replication,  result-
ing  in  shortening  of  the  chromosome.
When telomeres get “too short,” apopto-
sis of the cells is triggered. For this rea-
son, telomeres are thought to play a role
in  aging.  Telomerase  is  a  reverse  tran-
scriptase  enzyme  found  in  stem  cells
that can replicate the terminal base pairs
but  this  enzyme  is  not  found  in  most
cells. Many studies are ongoing that are
looking at the role of telomerase in aging
and cancer.

UV  exposure  may  contribute  to
telomere  shortening.  Telomeres  nor-
mally exist in a loop configuration, with
the loop held in place by the final 150 to
200  bases  on  the  3  strand  that  forms  a
single-stranded  overhang  (Figs.  19-1A
and B). It is believed that when the loop
is disrupted and the overhang becomes
exposed,  p53  (a  tumor  suppressor  pro-
tein)  and  other  DNA  damage  response
proteins are induced,16 resulting in apop-
tosis or senescence. UV light leads to the

which  may  lead  to  disruption  of  the
telomere  loop  (Fig.  19-2).  This  is  one
way  to  explain  the  overlap  seen  in
intrinsic and extrinsic aging.

Immune System

Aging  is  associated  with  an  increase  in
proinflammatory cytokines (see Chapter
4). These  cytokines  result  in  inflamma-
tion, which plays a role in degrading col-

lagen  and  elastin  as  well  as  other  vital
skin components. The role of cytokines
in aging has not been completely eluci-
dated, but this will likely be an area of
extreme  interest  in  upcoming  research.
The function of antigen-presenting cells,
T  cells,  and  B  cells  declines  with  age.
These changes are thought to contribute
to the higher risk of infections and can-
cer observed in older patients.17

Other Factors

The endocrine system may contribute to
aging. It is likely that insulin, vitamin D,
and  thyroid  hormone  levels  influence
skin aging in ways that have not yet been
elucidated.  Hormones,  especially  estro-
gen and androgens, are significant factors
in the aging of skin (see Chapter 5).

PREVENTION AND
TREATMENT

Identifying  skin  types  predisposed  to
wrinkling is the first step in patient man-
agement.  The  Baumann  Skin  Typing
System (Chapter 9) is a useful classifica-
tion  approach,  aiding  physicians  and
patients to understand and manage their
skin needs to prevent and treat wrinkles.
Other  classification  systems,  such  as
those  by  Lemprele  and  Glogau  (see
Chapter 40), also help physicians quan-
tify  the  amount  of  wrinkling.  After
assessing the degree of wrinkling, patient
education  is  the  next  essential  step.
Patients  must  understand  that  preven-
tion of additional wrinkling is the main-
stay  of  managing  wrinkled  skin.  Effects
of  certain  behaviors  such  as  excessive
sun exposure and smoking should be dis-
cussed,  and 
treatment  plans  with
expected  and  realistic  results  should  be
explained  in  detail  with  patients.  It  is
well  known  that  sunscreen  and  sun
avoidance  are  key  elements  in  prevent-
ing extrinsic photoaging. Although UVA
is  more  often  implicated  in  cutaneous
aging, coverage for both UVA and UVB
is recommended when selecting a sun-
screen. A routine skin regimen contain-
ing retinoid application is also valuable
in both the prevention and treatment of
aging skin. Topical retinoids have been
shown  to  both  increase  collagen  syn-
thesis18
the  MMPs
involved  in  collagen  and  elastin  degra-
dation.19 Since oxidative stress resulting
from  UV  irradiation  and  free  radicals
are  implicated  in  skin  aging,  antioxi-
dants have an important role in the pre-
vention and treatment of wrinkles (see
Chapter  34).  Of  antioxidants,  vitamin
(ascorbic acid)  deserves  special 
C 

and  decrease 

 
 
 
attention.  Vitamin  C  is  well  recognized
for its role in the collagen synthesis path-
way via the prolyl hydroxylase enzyme.
Studies  have  revealed  a  reduction  of
wrinkles following topical application of
ascorbic  acid,20–22
correlating  with
increased  collagen  on  histology  of  the
treated  areas.21 Other  antioxidants  such
as  coenzyme  Q10  (ubiquinone),  green
tea, and vitamin E are also believed to be
of value in the prevention and treatment
of aging.

Recently,  photorejuvenation  has
become a popular approach to wrinkle
reduction.  Procedures  with  intensed
pulsed  light  (IPL)  and  light  emitting
diodes 
(LEDs)  have  also  shown
promising  results  in  the  treatment  of
wrinkled skin and photoaging23–26 (see
Chapter 24).

SUMMARY

Much  remains  to  be  learned  regarding
the  science  or  biomechanics  of  aging.
However, the field is rapidly progressing
with  increased  knowledge  about  the
roles  of  genetics,  stem  cells,  telomeres,
the  immune  system,  and  hormones.
Advances in these theoretical realms and
in  the  laboratory  will  certainly  lead  to
novel  therapies  in  the  future.  Specific
preventive  measures  and  treatment
modalities are well recognized and dis-
cussed  at  length  in  various  chapters  of
this book, including the roles of diet and
cigarette smoking. Sunscreen and topical
retinoids  are 
treatment
options, proven to be valuable in treat-
ing wrinkled skin. New data show that
retinoids improve skin texture in intrin-
sically  aged  skin  as  well  as  photodam-
aged skin.27 Patient education and com-
pliance, which are crucial in this matter,
may be achieved by providing thorough
information,  including  illustrations  of
the  benefits  of  treatments  and  behav-
ioral  changes  and  the  disadvantages  of
noncompliance.

Chemical Peels

Leslie Baumann, MD
Sogol Saghari, MD

The  use  of  chemical  peels  to  treat  the
aging  face  is  well  established  and  poses
minimal  risk  when  performed  by
educated  practitioners.  In  addition  to
improving  the  texture  of  the  skin  and
reducing  hyperpigmentation  and  mild
wrinkling,  peels  are  also  useful  in  the
treatment of acne, rosacea, and melasma.
In 1999, chemical peels were so popular
that  they  were  found  to  be  the  most
common  cosmetic  procedure  performed
in  the  United  States.1 In  2006,  chemical
peels were second only to Botox among
the top five minimally invasive cosmetic
procedures performed by board-certified
members  of  the  American  Society  of
Plastic Surgeons, with 1.1 million proce-
dures  performed.2 The  introduction  of
lasers  in  skin  rejuvenation  may  have
some impact on the frequency of chemi-
cal peel treatments. Although the claims
of what chemical peels can do have been

frequently overstated, there is actually an
abundance  of  research  on  the  utility  of
these products, which are used in physi-
cians’ offices and salons worldwide.

Chemical  peels  are  categorized  based
on  the  depth  of  the  procedure:  superfi-
cial,  medium  or  deep.  Superficial  peels
induce necrosis of all or parts of the epi-
dermis, from the stratum granulosum to
the basal cell layer (Figs. 20-1 and 20-2).
Medium-depth  peels  create  necrosis  of
the epidermis and part or all of the papil-
lary  dermis  in  the  treatment  area.  The
necrosis extends into the reticular dermis
following deep peels.3 Currently, superfi-
cial  peels  are  the  most  frequently  per-
formed  peels,  as  intense  pulsed  light,
laser resurfacing and dermabrasion have
essentially  supplanted  medium  and
deeper-depth  peels.  Superficial-  and
medium-depth peels do not significantly
ameliorate deep wrinkles or sagging skin,
but can improve the color and texture of
the skin thereby yielding a more youthful
appearance.  This  chapter  will  focus  on
and  differentiate  between  the  most  fre-
quently used in-office types of superficial
and  medium-depth  peels, 
including
mechanisms  of  action,  side  effects  and
results  obtained  with  the  various  acids

used in peels. Many of the ingredients in
these peels are also found in home prod-
ucts;  therefore,  some  skin  care  products
will be mentioned in this chapter as well.

SUPERFICIAL PEELS

Although  a  wide  variety  of  agents  have
been shown to be effective for superficial
peeling,  alpha  hydroxy  acids  (AHAs),
beta hydroxy acid (BHA), Jessner’s solu-
tion, modified Jessner’s solution, resorci-
nol,  and  trichloroacetic  acid  (TCA)  are
the  most  commonly  used  in-office  peel
compounds. All of these compounds pro-
duce  effects  on  the  skin  by  inducing
desquamation  with  resultant  hastening
of the cell cycle. These solutions remove
the  superficial  layer  of  the  stratum
corneum  (SC),  yielding  skin  that  is
smoother in texture and more evenly pig-
mented.  The  individual  ingredients  of
these peels will be discussed but, notably,
these ingredients are often used in com-
bination.  Many  of  these  ingredients  are
found in home products as well.

AHAs AND BHA

AHAs  and  BHA  are  naturally-occurring
organic acids that contribute to inducing
exfoliation  and  accelerating  the  cell
cycle. Clearly there are myriad uses for
AHAs  and  BHA  in  the  practice  of  cos-
metic  dermatology.  Authors  have
reported success using such products in
the treatment of photoaging by improv-
ing  mottled  pigmentation,  fine  lines,
surface  roughness,  freckles,  and  lentig-
ines.  AHAs  and  BHA  have  also  been
used  with  success  to  treat  actinic  and
seborrheic keratoses.4

Research  in  the  1970s  demonstrated
that  topical  preparations  that  contain
AHAs  exert  profound  influence  on  epi-
dermal  keratinization.5 AHAs  and  BHA
affect  corneocyte  cohesiveness  at  the
lower levels of the SC,6 where they alter
its pH, thereby acting on the skin.7 When
AHAs and BHA are applied to the skin in
high concentrations, the result is detach-
ment of keratinocytes and epidermolysis;
application  at 
lower  concentrations
reduces intercorneocyte cohesion directly
above  the  granular  layer,  advancing
desquamation  and  thinning  of  the  SC.7
This has two major effects: quickening of
the  cell  cycle  (which  is  slowed  in  aged
skin) and increased desquamation, which
results in improvement of hyperpigmen-
tation and a smoother skin surface.

histologically  in  a  25%  increase  in  skin
thickness,  increased  acid  mucopolysac-
charides in the dermis, improved quality
of  the  elastic  fibers,  and  increased  colla-
gen density.8 These findings are desirable
because  they  imply  that  AHAs  reverse
some of the histologic signs of aging. This
was again illustrated in a mouse model by
Moon  et  al.,  who  reported  that  mice
treated with glycolic acid showed a signif-
icant  decrease  in  wrinkle  score  and  an
increase in the amount of collagen synthe-
sized.9 It  has  been  well  established  that
collagen  synthesis  decreases  with  aging
(see Chapter 6); therefore, increased syn-
thesis  of  collagen  may  help  retard  the
aging  process.  This  increase  of  collagen
production  after  treatment  with  AHAs
has been demonstrated both in vivo and
in vitro by using fibroblast cultures. In fact,
in a study by Kim et al., glycolic acid treat-
ments increased fibroblast proliferation in
vitro  as  well  as  collagen  production.10
Glycolic acid peels are sometimes used in
patients with acne; however, in a study by
Lee et al., application of two glycolic acid
peels  (30%)  or  Jessner’s  solution  with 
a  2-week  interval  failed  to  display  any 
effect on sebum production.11 Table 20-1

AHAs

AHAs are a group of naturally-occurring
compounds  that  contain  the  hydroxy
group in the alpha position. This versa-
tile  group  of  acids  includes  glycolic
acid, which is derived from sugar cane,
lactic  acid,  from  sour  milk,  citric  acid,
from  citrus  fruits,  and  phytic  acid,
which is derived from rice. The use of
hydroxy  acids  in  skin  care  products
dates  back  to  ancient  Egypt  and
Cleopatra,  who  was  said  to  have
applied  sour  milk  to  her  face  to
enhance its youthfulness. 

TABLE 20-1
Commonly Used Glycolic Acid Peel Brandsa

GLYCOLIC ACID Glycolic acid (Fig. 20-3) is
the AHA most commonly used in chem-
ical peels in the offices of dermatologists
and aestheticians. It is popularly known
as “the lunchtime peel” because it can be
completed  during  the  patient’s  lunch
hour and the patient can return to work
without  any  telltale  signs.  The  glycolic
peel was one of the first superficial chem-
ical peels to become popular because of
its effectiveness and ease of use.

Well-designed  studies  have  demon-
strated  the  efficacy  of  AHA  peels  as  a
treatment for photoaging. In 1996, Ditre
showed that application of AHAs resulted

provides  a  list  of  the  most  commonly
used glycolic acid peel brands.

Glycolic  acid  peels  are  inexpensive
and easy to use. However, unlike many
other peels, glycolic acid must be neu-
tralized after use so as to prevent burn-
ing. For this reason, it is difficult to use
on  large  areas  of  the  body.  It  is  best
used in a small area on which applica-
tion can be quickly applied and quickly
neutralized.

LACTIC  ACID Lactic  acid  (Fig.  20-4) is  a
popular AHA that is found in many at-
home  products  and  prescription  mois-
turizers. It is usually not used as an in-
office peel. Lactic acid is hypothesized
to be part of the skin’s natural moistur-
izing factor which plays a role in hydra-
tion12 (see Chapter 11). Several studies
on the activity of buffered 12% ammo-
nium lactate lotion (LacHydrin™) have
documented  its  moisturizing  ability.13
Lactic  acid  also  has  been  shown  to
impart  antiaging  benefits  similar  to
those  seen  with  glycolic  acid.  One
study  demonstrated 
increase 
in  skin  firmness  and  thickness  and
improvement in skin texture and mois-
turization  using  5%  and  12%  lactic
acid. These effects were limited to the
epidermis as no effect on dermal firm-
ness or thickness was seen.14

an 

OTHER  EFFECTS  OF AHAs Aged  skin,  in
addition  to  manifesting  wrinkles  and
pigmentation abnormalities, is generally
dryer than younger skin. Most cosmetic
dermatologists forget that AHAs are also
effective  moisturizing  agents  because
they  have  humectant  properties  (see
Chapter  32).  Interestingly,  lactic  acid  is
one of the few ingredients in the United
States  that  is  available  in  the  same
strength over the counter (OTC) and in
prescription  form.  LacHydrin™  is  actu-
ally  an  FDA-approved  drug  for  use  in
dry  skin,  but  not  for  photoaged  skin.
AHAs are beneficial in dry skin because
they  function  as  humectants,  causing
the  skin  to  hold  onto  water.  They  also

enhance desquamation thereby normal-
izing the SC by getting rid of the cling-
ing  keratinocytes  that  make  the  skin
look rough and scaled. Once the desqua-
mation  is  enhanced,  the  skin  is  more
flexible  and  better  able  to  reflect  light.
Although  many  patients  with  sensitive
skin are afraid to try AHAs, the irritation
induced by some of these acids has been
shown to be related to the formulation
rather  than  the  AHA  itself.15 In  fact,
AHAs have actually been demonstrated
to reduce the irritation experienced when
known irritants are placed on the skin. It
is thought, but not proven, that AHAs can
actually increase skin barrier function. In
one  study,  glycolic  acid,  lactic  acid,  tar-
taric acid, and gluconolactone were com-
pared in a double-blind, vehicle- and neg-
ative-controlled  randomized  trial.  It  was
found  that  all  of  these  AHAs  protected
the  skin  from  irritation  caused  by  a  5%
sodium lauryl sulfate challenge patch test
as  measured  by  resulting  erythema  and
changes  in  transepidermal  water  loss
(TEWL).  In  fact,  this  study  showed  that
TEWL  is  not  altered  by  application  of
AHAs. It is interesting that AHAs are able
to cause a sheet-like separation of the SC
that is not associated with compromise of
the  barrier  function.7 The  exact  mecha-
nism of action of how AHAs impart this
protection  is  currently  unknown;  how-
ever,  these  agents  may  prove  useful  in 
the management of skin diseases asso-
ciated with diminished barrier function 
and  a  susceptibility  to  irritant  contact
dermatitis.

BHA

Also known as salicylic acid (SA), BHA
is  another  commonly  used  type  of  in-
office  chemical  peel  used  by  aestheti-
cians  and  cosmetic  dermatologists.
These formulations are also available in
OTC home products that have lower con-
centrations  of  acids  (usually  0.5%–2%)
than  those  used  in  the  office  (usually
20%–30%). Derived from willow bark,
wintergreen leaves, and sweet birch, SA
is the only member of the BHA family,
so  named  because  the  aromatic  car-
boxylic acid has a hydroxy group in the
beta position (Fig. 20-5). This is actually a
misnomer  because  the  carbons  of  aro-
matic  compounds  are  traditionally  given
Arabic numerals (1, 2, etc.) rather than the
Greek  letter  designations  typical  for  the
nonaromatic structures. It is likely that SA
was  labeled  as  a  BHA  at  the  time  BHA
peels were introduced in order to market
the products and benefit from the popu-
larity of AHAs. Although BHA is a newer
category of chemical peels, SA is hardly a

new agent—it had a long history of effec-
tiveness before it was labeled as a BHA.

Most  physicians  use  preparations  of
20% or 30% SA for in-office peels. Such
peels have been shown to fade pigment
spots,  decrease  surface  roughness,  and
reduce fine lines,16 with similar results to
those  seen  with  AHAs.  In  the  early
1990s,  Swinehart  reported  satisfactory
results  using  50%  SA  on  the  hands  and
forearms of patients exhibiting actinically
induced  pigmentary  changes  in  those
areas.4 These effects are likely caused by
increased  exfoliation  and  an  accelerated
cell cycle, as seen with AHAs. However,
unlike  AHAs,  BHA  affects  the  arachi-
donic  acid  cascade  and,  therefore,
exhibits  anti-inflammatory  capabilities.
These properties may allow SA peels to
be effective while inducing less irritation
than  AHA  peels.  A  1997  double-blind
consumer-perception study of neurosen-
sory  discomforts  after  3  weeks  of  use
confirmed  that  SA  is  perceived  by
patients  as  being  milder  than  glycolic
acid.  Of  subjects  treated  with  glycolic
acid,  20%  reported  subjective  adverse
reactions,  while  4%  to  7%  of  the  SA
group  reported  such  reactions.17 The
lower  incidence  of  perceived  irritation
caused  by  SA  has  contributed  to  the
great  popularity  of  in-office  peels  and
home  products  that  contain  BHA.  The
anti-inflammatory effects of BHA make
it a very useful peel in patients with acne
and  rosacea  (Fig.  20-6).  It  can  be  com-
bined  with  traditional  acne  therapy  to
speed the resolution of comedones and
red  inflamed  papules  (see  Chapter  15).
SA peels may have a whitening effect in
patients  with  darker  skin  types.  In  a
study  of  24  Asian  women  who  were
treated  with  bi-weekly  facial  peeling
with  30%  SA  in  absolute  ethanol  for 
3 months, some lightening of skin color
was seen.18 These peels can also lead to
postinflammatory  hyperpigmentation.
The risks of skin lightening or darkening
should  be  explained  to  patients  with
darker skin types prior to their use. The
trick is to use a strong enough peel to be

It is important to note that the frost seen in a
BHA peel represents precipitated SA, while
the frost in a TCA peel represents precipi-
tated skin proteins. These “skipped” areas
seen in a TCA peel should not be touched
up as they can be with a BHA peel,
because the TCA peel frosting time
depends on the concentration used. Lower
concentrations take longer to frost. BHA
peels frost in 2 minutes. Retouching the
unfrosted areas of a TCA peel could result
in burning the patient and should be
strongly discouraged.

Although there is a wealth of evidence
that suggests that AHAs stimulate colla-
gen  production,  there  are  no  published
data examining the effects of BHA on col-
lagen synthesis. Many authors postulate,
however,  that  the  increased  collagen
synthesis seen with AHAs and retinoids
may  be  due  in  part  to  the  resulting
inflammation, which may stimulate col-
lagen synthesis. If this is true, one would
expect that SA would also increase colla-
gen synthesis.

BHA also differs from the AHAs inso-
far as it does not need to be neutralized
and  the  frost  is  visible  once  the  peel  is
complete (Box 20-1). The practitioner can
readily observe the uniformity of applica-
tion of a BHA peel because of the white
precipitate  of  SA  that  forms  (Fig.  20-7).

effective but not strong enough to induce
inflammation.  If  in  doubt  use  a  lower
strength peel and titrate to stronger peels
in future sequential treatments.

Another  difference  between  AHAs
and BHA is that BHA is lipophilic, which
enables  it  to  penetrate  the  sebaceous
material in the hair follicle and exfoliate
the  pores.18 AHAs,  which  are  water-
soluble,  do  not  exhibit  this  comedolytic
characteristic19 (Table  20-2). Kligman

evaluated  this  phenomenon  in  a  study
that  compared  the  number  of  micro-
comedones  seen  in  biopsies  of  women
treated  with  2%  SA  to  those  from
women  treated  with  8%  glycolic  acid.
The  glycolic 
formulation  did  not
decrease  the  density  of  microcome-
dones, whereas a statistically significant
(p (cid:6) 0.05)  decrease  was  seen  after  BHA
application.17 Therefore,  because  of  its
lipophilic nature, BHA confers a stronger
comedolytic effect than do AHAs.

SA is currently a popular component
of many in-office peels using a combina-
tion  of  ingredients.  Examples  include
the  Jessner’s  Peel,  the  PCA  Peel™  by
Physician’s  Choice,  and  the  Pigment
Plus Peel™ by Biomedic.

DISADVANTAGES OF HYDROXY ACIDS AHAs
are a significant set of options in an anti-
aging  armamentarium;  however,  it  is
important  for  patients  to  have  realistic
expectations.  Superficial  chemical  peels
are only able to produce subtle changes
in  the  skin  with  each  peel.  It  is  the
cumulative  benefits  of  the  peels  that
yield the most noticeable changes in the
skin.  At  least  four  superficial  peels  are
usually  necessary  before  patients  can
begin to see amelioration of photodam-
age, solar lentigos, and melasma. Those
with  more  severe  damage  may  require
eight or more. If this is not explained to
patients,  they  will  become  discouraged
after one or two chemical peels and will
not  be  compliant  with  the  prescribed
regimen. Patients must also be told that
superficial  peels  are  unable  to  correct
moderate  to  severe  wrinkles  and  scars
even though many OTC cosmetic prod-
ucts promise these unrealistic changes. If
patients’ expectations are realistic, they
will  be  pleased  with  the  results  that
superficial  peels  can  provide (Figs.  20-8
and 20-9).

Although  AHAs  are  very  popular  as
ingredients  in  daily  cleansers  and  mois-
turizers,  some  experts  have  suggested
that continued use of hydroxy acids may
lead  to  a  decrease  in  efficacy  with  con-
tinued use because of accommodation of
the skin. It is postulated that this occurs
because  the  skin  becomes  a  better  acid
buffer  and  is  able  to  more  efficiently
neutralize  the  effects  of  the  acids.14 At
this time there is no published evidence
to support this claim, but this possibility
should be kept in mind. It may be bene-
ficial to have patients stop their hydroxy
acid preparations periodically to enhance
the efficacy of these products when used
long term.

Although  AHAs  are  well  known  to
make the SC appear more compact, this
effect has not been associated with the
use of SA in the literature. However, it is
likely  that  BHA  has  the  same  effect.
AHAs,  but  surprisingly  not  BHA,  were
under scrutiny in the past because of the
fear that AHAs “thinned” the skin. This
has  not  been  proven.  There  is  concern
that the thinner SC will provide less of a
barrier to harmful environmental factors

(cid:2) FIGURE 20-8 Prior to a superﬁcial modiﬁed Jessner’s peel. Note the solar lentigos.

Any  areas  that  have  been  inadequately
peeled  can  be  easily  identified  and  then
treated by reapplying the BHA solution.
Also,  timing  of  the  peel  is  unnecessary,
and  the  risk  of  overpeeling  is  remote
because  once  the  vehicle  becomes
volatile, which occurs in approximately 2
minutes, there is very little penetration of
the active agent. It is important to imme-
diately use the chemical peel liquid once
the cap has been taken off the bottle, oth-
erwise  it  will  evaporate  and  change  the
efficacy.  In  addition,  do  not  use  a  fan
when  you  use  this  peel  because  it  will
increase  the  rate  at  which  the  vehicle
becomes  volatile  and  will  lessen  the
effect of the peel. Because neutralization
of the BHA peel is unnecessary, it is eas-
ier  to  apply  to  larger  areas  of  the  body
such as the back and chest that are diffi-
cult to adequately neutralize. However, it
is unwise to peel large surface areas of the
body  with  SA  in  one  office  visit.
Although toxic levels of salicylates have
not been reported in association with the
concentrations  currently  used  for  SA

peels,3 there  have  been  case  reports  of
children  with  multiple  excoriations  and
elderly  patients  with  ichthyosis  treated
with  topicals  containing SA  that  devel-
oped  salicylism.20 Therefore, large  body
surfaces should be treated with care and
the physician should watch for the signs
of salicylism, which include nausea, dis-
orientation,  and  tinnitus.  Of  course,
BHA,  whether  in  concentrations  devel-
oped  for  in-office  peels  or  in  at-home
products,  is  contraindicated  in  patients
who  are  pregnant,  breast-feeding,  or
allergic to aspirin.

Many  home  care  product  formula-
tions  contain  SA.  Typically,  they  are
labeled  as  “acne  washes”  and  contain
0.5% to 2% SA. These products are an
excellent  addition  to  a  home  care  regi-
men for acne, rosacea, photoaging, and
pigmentation disorders. Notably, irrita-
tion  and  skin  dryness  can  result  from
such products, especially since patients
tend  to  use  higher  and  higher  concen-
trations  of  home  products  to  maintain
exfoliation.  Patients  should  use  an

 
 
 
pare  one  brand  of  chemical  peel  to
another.  For  example,  a  30%  glycolic
acid peel from one company is not nec-
essarily  the  same  strength  as  a  30%
glycolic  peel  from  another  company.
The acid percentage is only a small part
of  the  story.  It  is  necessary  to  consider
the  pH,  the  amount  of  free  acid,  the
additive ingredients, and whether or not
the  peel  is  buffered  before  comparing
different peeling brands.

The Signiﬁcance of the pKa In order to use
AHAs  and  BHA  properly,  one  must
understand the pKa and how the pH of a
peel affects its efficacy. The pKa of a sub-
stance  measures  its  capacity  to  donate
protons. The pKa is the pH at which the
level of free acid is the same as the level of
the salt form of the acid. When the pH is
less than the pKa, the free acid form, the
one responsible for exfoliation of the skin,
predominates;  when  the  pH  is  greater
than the pKa, the salt form predominates.
The acid form is the “active form” in the
peel  because  it  causes  exfoliation.  It  is
necessary  to  have  the  proper  balance  of
the salt and acid forms to have an effica-
cious  peel  with  minimal  irritation.  The
pKa for salicylic acid is 2.97 while 3.83 is
the pKa for the AHAs.23,24 Because the pKa
of BHA differs from that of the AHA fam-
ily, it is difficult to formulate a combina-
tion product containing both that reaches
an optimal pH. For example, in a combi-
nation AHA–BHA product with a pH of
3.5, the AHA acid form would predomi-
nate  but  the  BHA  salt  form  would  pre-
dominate. The effects of BHA would be
rendered suboptimal then.

Signiﬁcance of the pH The higher the pH,
the more basic the solution is; the lower
the pH, the more acidic the solution is.
The  irritation  induced  by  a  product  is
often directly related to how low the pH
is. Lower pH equates to increased irrita-
tion, as well as efficacy.

Buffered  solutions Some  chemical  peel
formulations are “buffered.” Many com-
panies claim that this increases the toler-
ability  of  these  agents.  A  product  is
buffered  when  a  base  such  as  sodium
bicarbonate  or  sodium  hydroxide  is
added to the solution. This produces an
increased amount of the salt form, which
results in less free acid and a higher pH.
Buffered  solutions  are  resistant  to  pH
changes when a salt or an acid is added
to  the  preparation.  Because  these  solu-
tions have a lower pH and less free acid,
there is a decrease in side effects; how-
ever, there may also be a decrease in effi-
cacy.  These  formulations  are  safer  for

such as ultraviolet (UV) light and toxins
in  the  environment.  Although  studies
have  shown  that  TEWL  is  not  affected
by the use of AHAs, there was still con-
cern that the barrier would be disturbed
in  skin  treated  with  AHAs.  In  1999,  a
study  evaluated  the  barrier  integrity  of
hairless guinea pigs after treatment with
5%  and  10%  glycolic  acid  at  pH  3.0.
Investigators  found  no  increase  in  skin
penetration  of  exogenously  applied
hydroquinone,  musk  xylol,  and  3H
water  when  compared  to  controls.
However, they did find that the guinea
pigs  treated  with  the  glycolic  prepara-
tions  had  approximately  a  two-fold
increase in  epidermal  thickness  and
almost double the number of nucleated
cell layers as compared with the control
group.21 This suggests that although the
SC is thinned by AHAs, the overall epi-
dermis is thicker. Another concern with
AHAs is that they may increase photo-
sensitivity. A study by Tsai et al. demon-
strated that pretreatment of human skin

with  10%  glycolic  acid  caused  an
increase in UVB-induced skin tanning in
Caucasian  and  Asian  subjects  and  an
increase  in  UVA  tanning  in  Asian  sub-
jects  (but  not  Caucasians).22 Many  cos-
metic  companies  have  also  noted  that
increased numbers of sunburn cells have
been seen in patients treated with AHA
preparations. The FDA is now requiring
that all AHA preparations be labeled to
inform  patients  about  photosensitivity
and to advise using sunscreens.

EVALUATING  AND  COMPARING  HYDROXY
ACID PREPARATIONS The most important
aspect  of  chemical  peel  strength  is  the
amount  of  available  free  acid.  The
amount of free acid itself is affected by
the following: concentration of the peel
(%  hydroxy  acid),  the  pKa of  the  acid
preparation,  the  pH  of  the  solution
(which  is  also  affected  by  the  type  of
vehicle  used),  and  whether  or  not  the
peel is buffered. Because of this complex
interplay of factors, it is difficult to com-

 
 
use  by  beginners  and  nonphysicians,
which may account for their popularity.

Vehicle It is important to remember that
the  vehicle  can  also  cause  irritation  to
the patient. In fact, studies indicate that
irritation  associated  with  AHA  prod-
ucts  is  usually  related  to  the  formula-
tion of the product and not to the AHA
itself.7 Also,  the  difference  in  vehicles
can contribute to variations in the clini-
cal  response.  Some  companies  add
strontium  nitrate  (e.g.,  Cosmederm-
7™)  to  decrease  the  sensory  irritation
of  AHA  solutions.  In  one  study,  when
strontium nitrate and 70% glycolic acid
were applied to the volar arm, patients
exhibited  less  burning  and  stinging
than  when  70%  glycolic  acid  was
applied alone to the other arm.25 There
is  no  evidence  that  the  strontium
nitrate decreases redness or epidermol-
ysis, but there is good evidence that it
decreases  the  itching  and  burning  sen-
sations without affecting the efficacy of
the glycolic preparations. Other agents
that increase penetration, such as urea,
may affect the efficacy of these topical
products;  therefore,  it  is  important  to
know all the ingredients in each topical
preparation.

RESORCINOL Resorcinol has been used as
a  chemical  peeling  agent  since  Unna
described  its  use  in  1882.26 A  phenol
derivative,  resorcinol  (m-dihydroxyben-
zene)  exhibits  antipruritic,  keratolytic,
antimycotic, and antiseptic properties. It
is  mainly  used  as  a  treatment  for  pig-
mentary disorders and acne, but is also a
lone peeling agent and a common com-
ponent  of  combination  chemical  peels,
including  the  Jessner’s  peel  (Fig.  20-10).
In a study of nine patients treated with a
53%  concentration  of  resorcinol  once
weekly for 10 weeks, all subjects showed
an average of 0.03 mm improvement in
thickness  of  their  epidermis  and  five
patients  exhibited  enhanced  elastosis.
Verhoeff’s  stain  showed  an  improve-
ment of elastic fibers in all cases.27

Care  must  be  taken  to  limit  the
surface  area  treated  because  systemic
toxicity similar to that seen with phenol 
has  been  reported.  Prolonged  use  has
been associated with myxedema because
the  drug  has  an  antithyroid  action 
and  methemoglobinemia  in  children.
Resorcinol  is  a  primary  irritant  and  a
moderately strong sensitizer that seldom
produces  allergic  contact  dermatitis.
However, contact allergy to resorcinol in
topical acne products and in Castellani’s
paint  have  been  reported.28 Although
resorcinol is very useful in the treatment

of  hyperpigmentation  disorders,  it  can
cause  hyperpigmentation  in  patients
with a Fitzpatrick skin type greater than
IV and should be used with great care in
these patients. The possibility of deeper
penetration  and  achieving  a  medium-
depth peel with resorsinol is also worth
consideration.29 This can be achieved by
pretreatment  with  tretinoin, increasing
the absorption of the peeling agent.

Other Peels

Several popular peels consist of a combi-
nation  of  active  ingredients.  The  first
combination  peel  to  gain  wide  usage
was  Jessner’s  peel.  It  is  still  commonly
used today. Many peels such as the PCA
Peel by Physician’s Choice use a formula
known  as  a  “modified  Jessner’s  peel.”
These  peels  contain  many  of  the  same
ingredients  as  the  classic  Jessner’s  peel
but  employ  different  combinations.
They will not be discussed in this chap-
ter but are listed in Table 20-3.

JESSNER’S SOLUTION This popular peel is
a combination of resorcinol 14 g, salicylic
acid 14 g, and lactic acid 14 g in a suffi-
cient quantity of ethanol (95%) to make
100  cc  of  solution.  It  can  be  purchased
already made from many companies. Dr.
Max  Jessner  originally  formulated  this
peel to reduce the concentration and tox-
icity of each of the individual ingredients
while increasing efficacy.30 The strength
of the peel is determined by how many
layers  are  applied  and  if  it  is  used  in
combination  with  other  peeling  formu-
las. Jessner’s peel is popularly used with
other  peels  because  it  does  not  have  to
be  neutralized.  Once  the  peel  frosts,  a
second type of peel such as TCA can be
applied  on  top  of  the  Jessner’s  peel  to
increase  the  depth  of  the  overall  peel.
Although this peel is very safe, it should
be  used  with  caution  on  patients  with
darker  skin  types  because  resorcinol  is
associated with an increased risk of post-
in
inflammatory  hyperpigmentation 
those  with  Fitzpatrick  skin  type  IV  and

greater. Patients may also develop a con-
tact  dermatitis  to  resorcinol  that  mani-
fests as redness and swelling. Topical or
oral  steroids  may  be  used  to  treat  this
uncommon side effect.

Use of the Jessner’s peel The solution can
be used in conjunction with other agents
like glycolic acid, 5-fluouracil, and TCA
as it enhances the effects of each. When
used alone, a thin coat of the solution is
applied to all areas to be treated. Prior to
treatment,  a  thin  layer  of  Vaseline  or
Aquaphor  is  applied  to  the  areas  not
intended for treatment, such as the naso-
alar grooves, where the solution tends to
pool,  and  the  lips.  The  practitioner
should  take  precautions  to  avoid  drip-
ping  the  solution  into  undesired  areas.
The  first  coat  is  complete  once  frosting
occurs  (usually  in  3  to  5  minutes).  The
patient  usually  experiences  noticeable
flaking  for  approximately  7  days.  If  a
deeper peel is desired, two or three coats
may  be  applied  with  a  resulting  eleva-
tion  in  peeling,  efficacy  and,  of  course,
side  effects.  When  using  this  peel  on
patients  with  a  tendency  to  develop
dyschromias,  such  as  patients  with
melasma,  postinflammatory  hyperpig-
mentation, etc., it is a good idea to pro-
ceed slowly with one coat of the solution
every 2 to 3 weeks to avoid exacerbating

the  hyperpigmentation.  This  peel  is
excellent for use in acne patients because
resorcinol is a well-known treatment for
acne.  It  is  also  effective  in  rosacea
patients because it contains salicylic acid.
Modified  Jessner’s  peel  combinations
containing  added  ingredients  such  as
hydroquinone  and  kojic  acid 
(see 
Chapter 33), or ones that omit resorcinol
for  individuals  that  are  sensitive  to  this
component,  are  available.  In  order  to
avoid systemic absorption and the com-
bined  effects  of  the  resorcinol  and  sali-
cylic acid, this peel should not be used on
large body areas at once.31

TRETINOIN PEEL For several years, topical
tretinoin  has  been  successfully  used  in
various preparations for the treatment of
melasma, acne, and photoaging. Topical
tretinoin  is  known  to  induce  increased
collagen  deposition,32 and  inhibit  the
for
metalloproteinases 
degrading collagen.33 The tretinoin peel
is  not  available  in  the  United  States;
however,  it  is  used  in  many  countries
such as Brazil off-label for the treatment
of photoaging, melasma, acne, and ker-
atosis  pilaris.  The  peeling  solution  is
orange in color, preserved in brown con-
tainers, and painted on the desired treat-
ment  site.  The  patient  is  advised  to
wash off the solution after 4 to 6 hours

of  treatment.  The  peeling  may  be  vari-

Kligman et al. studied tretinoin 0.25% in
a  solution  of  50%  ethanol  and  50%
polyethylene  glycol  400  in  50  women
between  30  and  60  years  of  age  with
diagnoses  of  photoaging,  rosacea,  and
acne.  The  solution  was  applied  to  the
face by the patients every other night for
2  weeks  and  later,  on  a  nightly  basis.
Patients  showed  clinical  improvements
as manifested by a smoother appearance
of the epidermis, reduction of fine lines,
and  improvement  of  hyperpigmenta-
tion. Histologic examination of the skin
revealed  increased  thickness  of  the 
basal layer and fibroblasts in the papillary
of
dermis, 
melanosomes,  diminished  SC  thickness,
and better organized rete ridges. Kligman
and colleagues proposed that the effects
of using low-strength tretinoin for 6 to 12
months  may  be  achieved  by  higher
strengths in 4 to 6 weeks.34

days and patients had the peel on for 6
to  8  hours.  Fifteen  days  following  the
last  application  a  second  biopsy  was
performed, which showed increasing of
the epidermal thickness and thinning of
the SC.35 These findings also correlated
with  clinically  better  looking  skin.  The
histologic  and  clinical  evaluation  of
patients’ skin in this study indicated that
to achieve the same effect of a tretinoin
peel  after  2.5  weeks  one  must  use
topical  tretinoin  for  approximately 
4  to  6  months.  In  another  study  of 
10  patients  with  Fitzpatrick  skin  types
III  to  V  and  moderate  to  severe
melasma, a 1% tretinoin peel was com-
pared  to  a  70%  glycolic  acid  peel.  The
tretinoin  peel  was  left  on  the  treated
area for 4 hours while the glycolic peel
was placed for a maximum of 3 minutes.
Both  peels  were  found  to  be  equally
effective  at  3  months  posttreatment,
though less erythema and desquamation
were associated with the tretinoin peel,
which was therefore better tolerated by
the patients.36

Side Effects of All Types of
Superﬁcial Peels

Although  superficial  chemical  peels  are
very  safe  when  used  properly  they  can
all  cause  erythema,  itching,  peeling,
increased  skin  sensitivity,  and  even

155

 
 
epidermolysis.  Allergic  contact  dermati-
tis has been reported to occur with resor-
cinol, salicylic acid, kojic acid, lactic acid,
and  hydroquinone.  Irritant  contact  der-
matitis has been linked to glycolic acid.
Any peel can cause an irritant dermatitis
when  used  with  excessive  frequency,

inappropriately  high  concentrations,  or
with  a  vigorous  skin  preparation  using
acetone  or  another  “degreasing”  solu-
tion. Patients with a recent insult to the
SC,  such  as  beginning  a  regimen  with
tretinoin, facial shaving, use of “exfoliat-
ing” scrubs and Buff-Puffs™, or kissing a

person with a heavy beard for prolonged
periods, are more susceptible to chemical
peels  extending  deeper  than  intended.
Consequently,  it  is  necessary  to  closely
examine the condition of the skin and get
a  good  history  from  the  patient  prior  to
performing a peel (Box 20-2).

BOX 20-2 How to Use Chemical Peels—Dr. Baumann’s Perspective

There are several brands of superﬁcial chemical
peels available on the market. In the case of
AHAs, one must know the pH and concentra-
tion of free acid in the individual products in
order to compare strength and efﬁcacy
across products. The practitioner must exer-
cise extra caution when treating patients
with darker skin types, regardless of the
chemical peel selected, to avoid hyperpig-
mentation. For such patients, the practi-
tioner should start with the lowest concen-
tration of free acid and slowly increase the
concentration.

1. At the ﬁrst visit, assess the patient’s skin

using a UV or Wood’s light to determine the
extent of pigmentation abnormalities. This will
help convince the patient of the necessity of
sunscreen use. Take regular pictures and UV
camera photographs if possible. Determine
the patient’s Baumann Skin Type (see
Chapter 9). Discuss skin care, sunscreen use
and the importance of topical retinoid treat-
ments (Chapter 30) and offer product recom-
mendations based on the patient’s skin type.
Also at this juncture, it is imperative to cau-
tion patients to refrain from using at-home
topical AHAs, BHA, and other irritating ingre-
dients such as vitamin C in order to avoid
excessive skin irritation. In addition, the physi-
cian should make sure that the patient is not
using another form of exfoliation such as
facial scrubs or Buff-Puffs™. The practitioner
should treat each patient, even those with
type I skin, with the lowest strength peel of
the chosen brand (or the one requiring the
shortest duration on the face) on the ﬁrst visit
to ascertain the patient’s level of sensitivity.
Explain to patients that they will not notice
much difference in their skin after the ﬁrst
peel because it is only a low-strength solution
used to determine their ability to tolerate the
peel. It is important at each visit, but particu-
larly so at the ﬁrst visit, to ﬁnd out if the
patient has any signiﬁcant forthcoming social
obligations that might be compromised or
made embarrassing owing to erythema or
conspicuous skin ﬂaking. There is a low inci-
dence of hypersensitivity reactions (most
commonly seen with the Jessner’s peel) that,
according to Murphy’s law, occur preferen-
tially in those patients with an important party
or lecture coming up. Patients should return
within 10 to 14 days for a follow-up and to
receive the next peel.

(cid:2) FIGURE 20-11 Patient on Retin A with retinoid dermatitis. Peeling this patient will result in excessive
redness and scaling. It is best to wait 1 week prior to proceeding with chemical peeling.

2. At the second visit, the practitioner can go to
the next level in peel strength if the patient
experienced minimal or no peeling after the
initial peel. Most patients are started on a
topical retinoid on the ﬁrst visit so care must
be taken to avoid peeling skin that exhibits
“retinoid dermatitis” (Fig. 20-11). In such a
case, the practitioner should refrain from
performing a peel until the retinoid dermatitis
resolves. On this visit, it is also important to
assess how well the patient tolerates the
social/psychological impact of peeling. If the
patient complains about ﬂaking skin or ery-
thema, the physician should titrate the peels
more slowly. If the patient feels that signiﬁ-
cant erythema and/or ﬂaking are the sine
qua non of an adequate peel, the physician
may want to proceed more rapidly.

3. Visit Three and Beyond—Manufacturers of
most superﬁcial chemical peel brands rec-
ommend treatments at 10- to 14-day inter-
vals. One may continue the peelings until the
initial presenting symptoms have resolved
and, thereafter, perform peels at 4-week
intervals for maintenance. One should occa-
sionally inquire about retinoid and sunscreen
use to ensure patient compliance. After the
third peel, patients should be consistently
using the retinoids with no skin irritation. If
this is the case, it is a good time to add an
at-home AHA or BHA preparation. There are
many brands to choose from and skin care
product ingredients are discussed at length
throughout this text to help you decide which
products to recommend.

 
 
 
Postinflammatory  hyperpigmenta-
tion is a rare complication in superficial
chemical  peels  that  are  started  at  low
strengths  and  titrated  up  very  slowly.
Grimes  followed  25  patients  with
Fitzpatrick  skin  types  V  and  VI  who
were  treated  with  20%  and  30%  sali-
cylic  acid  peels.37 These  patients  were
pretreated  with  hydroquinone  4%  for 
2  weeks  prior  to  peeling.  Only  three
patients  developed  temporary  post-
inflammatory  hyperpigmentation.  No
residual  hyperpigmentation  was  seen.
Several studies have shown that superfi-
cial peels can also be used safely in Asian
patients.38,39 However, most dermatolo-
gists agree that these patients should be
pretreated  with  a  depigmenting  agent
and  tretinoin  and  should  be  advised  to
use  effective  sun  protection  offering
broad UVA and UVB coverage.

MEDIUM-DEPTH PEELS
Trichloroacetic Acid 10% to 40%

TCA  became  popular  in  the  1960s
through  the  work  of  Ayres.40 Low-
strength TCA (10%–15%) is used to ame-
liorate fine wrinkles and dyschromias and
to  provide  the  skin  with  a  smooth,
healthy  appearance.  TCA,  at  these
strengths, does not improve deeper wrin-
kles  or  scars.41,42 Higher-strength  TCA
(35%–40%) produces epidermal and der-
mal  necrosis  without  serious  systemic
toxicity.  It  must  be  used  with  extreme
caution, however, because hyperpigmen-
tation  and  scarring  can  result.  Prac-
titioners  should  carefully  select  patients,
noting  that  patients  with  darker  skin
types should not be treated with TCA as
they  have  an  increased  risk  for  postin-
flammatory hyperpigmentation.

TCA  at  35%  to  40%  is  the  standard
solution for medium-depth peels for the
face  and  hands.  When  discussing  the
strength of TCA peels, it is imperative to
discuss the strength in weight per volume
(wt/vol)  measurements.  Unfortunately,
not all authors use this form of measuring
so one must take care when reading and
basing  a  peel  on  the  literature  to  know
how the strength was calculated in order

to avoid underestimating the strength of
the peel. This precaution reduces the risk
of inducing scarring.43 For instance, 25%
TCA cannot be formed by diluting 50%
TCA  with  an  equal  volume  of  water
because  this  type  of  dilution  is  vol/vol
and  actually  yields  a  solution  stronger
than 25% wt/vol TCA. When following
a protocol from the literature, the practi-
tioner should calculate the TCA percent-
age  by  wt/vol  measurements  to  avoid
mistakes. TCA can be purchased accord-
ing to the desired wt/vol strength.

Following application of a TCA peel,
denatured protein causes a “frosting” of
the skin, signaling the completion of the
peel. The time lag between the applica-
tion  and  the  appearance  of  the  frost
varies  according  to  the  acid  concentra-
tion. The delay might last 5 to 7 seconds
after  application  of  40%  TCA,  but  can
last  as  long  as  15  to  20  minutes  after
application of a more dilute acid. This is
crucial for the practitioner to remember
in order to avoid overtreatment.

TCA can be applied alone or after use
of  Jessner’s  solution  or  glycolic  acid  to
achieve  a  deeper  peel.  Healing  time  is
usually between 5 and 7 days for patients
treated  only  with  TCA  and  between  7
and  10  days  for  patients  treated  with  a
combination of TCA and either Jessner’s
solution or glycolic acid.41,42

Available Brands of TCA Peels

Many physicians use the Delasco brand
of liquid TCA, which is available in var-
ious  concentrations  (Fig.  20-12).  Other
physicians  prefer  to  use  chemical  peel
kits that combine TCA with an indicator
that  reveals  when  the  peel  has  frosted.
Because there are legal concerns associ-
ated with the shipping of TCA, most of
the companies that sell these kits require
that  the  practitioner  purchase  the  TCA
solution  separately.  Table  20-4  lists  the
more commonly used TCA peels on the
market. Biomedic developed a combina-
tion of TCA and SA called “The Pigment
Peel  Plus,”  which  is  used  for  dyschro-
mias and photoaging in addition to acne.
Although  one  coat  of  these  peels  pro-
duces a superficial peel, several coats can

be applied to increase the peel to one of
medium depth. Other peels, such as the
Obagi  Blue  Peel™,  contain  only  TCA
(Figs. 20-13 and 20-14). This peel is also
applied in coats. One or two coats pro-
duce  a  superficial  peel  while  three  to
four  coats  produce  a  medium-depth
peel.

Pyruvic Acid

Pyruvic acid is an alpha ketoacid that is
physiologically converted to lactic acid,
thereby  rendering  it  a  chemical  peeling
agent  while  providing  hydration  to  the
skin.  Pyruvic  acid  penetrates  down  to
the  papillary  dermis  and  results  in
increased  production  of  collagen  and
elastic  tissue.44 It  is  important  to  note
that  pyruvic  acid  must  not  be  used  in
high-  or  full-strength  concentration
since there is the potential for scarring.45
The  pyruvic  acid  peel  has  been  used

peeling  should  be  complete  by  day  10;
however, the erythema may last until day
14. Patients should be shown pictures of
how they will look so that there will be

advise against using TCA at greater than

with success in the treatment of moder-
ate acne, photoaging, and melasma.46–48
Given the fact that pyruvic acid is con-
verted  into  CO2  and  acetaldehyde,  the
CO2 buildup  in  the  bottle  may  lead  to
explosion if the container is left in place
for a while.49

This chemical peel is usually used at
40%  to  60%  concentrations  on  facial
skin,  previously  prepared  with  topical
retinoids.  At  such  concentrations,  it  is
considered  a  medium-depth  peel  and
therefore must be used with caution in
darker skin types or patients with sensi-
tive or irritated skin. After 2 to 5 minutes,
or  when  adequate  frosting  is  observed,
the face is soaked in water, which is more
for the patient’s comfort rather than neu-
tralizing the peel.50 Some authors recom-
mend  neutralizing  a  pyruvic  acid  peel
with  10%  sodium  bicarbonate  and
water.48 Since the vapors from the chem-
ical  peel  may  be  strong  and  irritating  to
the upper respiratory tract, the procedure
is  best  done  in  a  well-ventilated  room
and  with  use  of  an  electrical  fan.
Reepithelialization  is  observed  in  1  to  2
weeks, while erythema may last for up to
2  months.50 Pyruvic  acid  has  also  been
used successfully in combination with 5-
fluouracil for the treatment of actinic ker-
atoses and warts.51,52

Side Effects and Precautions

Patients should be warned that they will
look terrible for at least 10 days following
a  medium-depth  peel.  During  the  first 
2 days, the skin appears slightly pink. On
days 3 and 4 the skin darkens. By day 5

tion of TCA. Various combinations have
been  used  including  glycolic  acid  fol-
lowed  by  TCA  (“Coleman  peel”)54 and
Jessner’s  peel 
followed  by  TCA
(“Monheit peel”). The initial application
of  Jessner’s  solution  results  in  reducing
the  cohesion  of  the  epidermal  cells,
allowing better and more even penetra-
tion  of  the  35%  TCA  solution.  This
combination is effective in mild to mod-
erate  photoaging,  including  lentigines,
pigmentary  changes,  and  rhytides55
(Box 20-3). Patients may need mild seda-
tion and  would  benefit  from  the  anti-
inflammatory  effects  of  NSAIDs  prior
to  this  procedure.  Dr.  Harold  Brody
popularized  the  use  of  solid  CO2 (dry
ice) followed by 35% TCA. The appli-
cation of solid CO2 also causes interrup-
tion  in  the  epidermal  consistency  and
deep  penetration  of  TCA.56 There  are
several excellent texts on chemical peel-
ing that further discuss these combina-
tion methods.

DEEP-DEPTH PEELS

Laser  surgery  and  dermabrasion  have
largely  supplanted  deep-depth  peels,
having  shown  superior  results  with
fewer  complications.  Currently,  there

pear  and  then  return  after  the  chemical
peel. This occurs because the melanocytes
that  are  responsible  for  pigmentation
reside below the level of the chemical peel
(see  Chapter  13).  The  results  will  be
improved  if  patients  use  retinoids,  sun-
screen,  and  hydroquinone  or  other
bleaching agents (Figs. 20-16 to 20-18).

Following  medium  peels,  as  with
superficial  ones,  it  is  important  for
patients to use sunscreen and to practice
sun avoidance. Patients with darker skin
types should use hydroquinone after the
peel to lower the incidence of hyperpig-
mentation.  Practitioners  should  admin-
ister  antiviral  medication  to  patients
with  a  history  of  herpes  simplex  infec-
tion. Also, it is important for the practi-
tioner  to  avoid  overzealously  applying
TCA, which can cause scarring. Patients
recently  treated  with  isotretinoin  are
also  particularly  vulnerable  to  scarring
from medium peels.

COMBINATION OF SUPERFICIAL 
AND MEDIUM-DEPTH PEELS

ing method to decrease and even out the

BOX 20-3 Superﬁcial Peel Indications

• Acne and Rosacea—BHA peels can be
used in all skin types. Resorcinol can be
used in Fitzpatrick skin types I and II and
light type III skin. Do not treat rosacea
patients with AHAs and retinoids because
it worsens the erythema.

• Melasma—Jessner’s peels, modiﬁed

Jessner’s peels and resorcinol are ﬁrst-line
choices here. Resorcinol can be used in
Fitzpatrick skin types I and II and light type
III skin. AHAs and BHA are also effective.
• Photoaging and mild wrinkles—All of the
mentioned chemical peels have been
shown to be useful for treatment of pho-
toaging. The choice of which to use
should be based on patient history, other
concurrent pathology, and the downtime
that the patient can tolerate.

• Pretreatment for a medium-depth peel—
One can “condition” the skin for a medium
peel by pretreating with any of the superﬁ-
cial peels. The likely method of action is
the quickening of the cell cycle pace. Most
physicians pretreat with topical retinoids,
bleaching agents, and three to four super-
ﬁcial peels prior to a medium-depth peel
for patients with Fitzpatrick skin type III.
Medium-depth peel indications—The indica-
tions are the same as those for superﬁcial
peels. The pathology is more signiﬁcant,
though. Therefore, severe acne and pho-
toaging would respond better to medium-
depth peels. Patients with a history of
hyperpigmentation disorders or with
Fitzpatrick skin type III or greater skin
should be treated very cautiously with
medium-depth peels.

are  modified  phenol  peels  such  as  the
Stone Venner-Kellson peel (composed of
phenol,  croton  oil,  water,  olive  oil,  and
septisol solution) available, but they are
rarely used by physicians in the United
States.  The  Stone  Venner-Kellson  peel
can  be  ordered  from  Delasco  and  the
ordering  physician  must  specify  the
ingredients.  Since  deep-depth  peels  are
no 
longer  popular  and  have  been
replaced  by  laser  surgery,  phenol  peels
and  other  deep-depth  peels  will  not  be
discussed here.

AT-HOME CHEMICAL PEELS

Chemical  peels  used  to  be  offered  by
dermatologists  or  trained  professionals
at  beauty  salons.  Recently,  many  com-
panies  have  developed  at-home  skin
peel  kits  mostly  using  AHA  as  their
main ingredient. Considering the poten-
tial  side  effects,  especially  increased
photosensitivity, 
the  FDA’s  AHA
Review  Committee  and  the  Cosmetic,
Toiletry,  and  Fragrance  Association’s
(CTFA)  Cosmetic  Ingredient  Review
(CIR)  Expert  Panel  reviewed  the  use  of

AHAs  in  cosmetic  products.57 In  1998,
the  CIR  Expert  Panel  came  to  the  fol-
lowing conclusion:

“Based  on  the  available  information
included  in  this  report,  the  CIR  Expert
Panel  concludes  that  glycolic  and  lactic
acid, their common salts and their sim-
ple  esters,  are  safe  for  use  in  cosmetic
products  at  concentrations  (cid:9)10%,  at
final formulation pH (cid:10) 3.5, when formu-
lated to avoid increasing sun sensitivity
or  when  directions  for  use  include  the
daily use of sun protection. These ingre-
dients are safe for use in salon products
at concentrations (cid:9)30%, at final formu-
lation pH (cid:10)3.0, in products designed for
brief,  discontinuous  use  followed  by
thorough  rinsing  from  the  skin,  when
applied  by  trained  professionals,  and
when  application  is  accompanied  by
directions  for  the  daily  use  of  sun
protection.”58

There  are  several  AHA  products
available as at-home peel kits. Resurface
Peel by Lancôme (8% glycolic acid and
5%  Physio-Peel  enhancer),  Glytone
Boost  Mini  Peel  Gel  (10.8%  glycolic
acid),  and  Dermo-Expertise  ReNoviste
Antiaging  Glycolic  Peel  Kit  by  L’Oréal

 
 
 
Peel,  which  also  contains  2%  SA,  in
addition to CelluZyme are examples of
these  products.  Also  available  are  peels
that  combine  AHA  and  BHA,  such  as
the  Swiss  Formula  Peel-Off  Hydroxy
Masque by St. Ives, which contains both
lactic acid and salicylic acid.

SUMMARY

Superficial and medium-depth peels are
dynamic  tools  when  used  as  part  of
office  procedures  for  the  treatment  of
acne,  pigmentation  disorders,  and  pho-
toaging. They should be used in combi-
nation  with  sun  avoidance,  sunscreen,
retinoids,  and  home  care  products  to
achieve maximum efficacy.

Prevention and
Treatment of Bruising

Susan Schaffer, RN
Sogol Saghari, MD
Leslie Baumann, MD

Ecchymoses, also known as bruises, occur
as a result of an injury to the capillaries,
allowing blood to leak into the underlying
tissue  (Figs.  21-1 and 21-2).  This  is  a
benign process that resolves within a few
days. Hematoma is a more serious entity,
when an injury to a blood vessel results in
the collection of blood in the surround-
ing  tissue.  The  enlarging  size  of  the
hematoma  may  push  on  vital  organs  or
lead  to  tissue  necrosis;  therefore,  they
should  be  avoided.  Hematomas  may  be
treated  conservatively  with  pressure
dressings, if active bleeding is not present,
or by drainage, if there is active bleeding
or the hematoma is enlarging in size.

In  a  healthy  individual  with  a  small
injury  to  a  capillary,  the  coagulation
process  results  in  a  fibrin  clot  in  the
damaged area and eventually healing of
the  vessel.  Platelets  are  an  essential
component  in  the  coagulation  process.
They become activated via exposure to
the  endothelial  lining  of  the  damaged
blood  vessel,  and  produce  coagulation
factors  in  addition  to  adhering  to  the
damaged  tissue  and  forming  a  platelet
clog.  The  process  of  hemostasis  also

(cid:2) FIGURE 21-2 Bruising 2 days after treatment with Botox to bunny lines in a patient on ibuprofen.

involves  the  coagulation  pathway,  a
complicated  cascade  involving  two
routes:  the  contact  activation  pathway,
also known as the intrinsic pathway, and
the tissue factor pathway, also known as
the extrinsic pathway (Fig. 21-3). Several
cofactors  are  required  for  the  proper
functioning  of  the  coagulation  path-
way. Vitamin K is an essential factor for
a  hepatic  enzyme  known  as  gamma
glutamyl carboxylase, which is involved
in the synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, and
X.  Calcium  is  also  required  in  several
steps  of  the  coagulation  pathway.  In
addition,  there  are  natural  anticoagu-
lants present, such as proteins C and S,

which  are  beyond  the  scope  of  our
discussion.

Following  coagulation  and  clot  for-
mation, the fibrinolysis process, which
is  necessary  for  breaking  down  the
clot,  occurs.  This  pathway  starts  with
the  activation  of  plasminogen,  a
protein synthesized in the liver that is
converted  to  plasmin  via  tissue  plas-
minogen activator (tPA) and other fac-
tors (Fig. 21-4). Plasmin degrades fibrin
into 
fibrin  degradation  products
(FDPs), which are the end result of this
cascade.

RATING BRUISE SEVERITY

At  this  time  there  are  no  published
scales  rating  bruise  severity.  Rating
bruise severity is important if one wants
to evaluate treatments aimed at prevent-
ing  bruising  or  accelerating  the  healing
of bruises. The authors have developed
the  Baumann-Castanedo  scale  to  rate
bruises. This scale is displayed in Tables
21-1 and 21-2. The Baumann-Castanedo
scale  will  allow  the  user  to  track  the
color  and  size  of  the  bruise  in  order  to
gauge severity and improvement.

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT

The initial bruised area is purplish-red in
color, later changing to green and yellow
before  the  discoloration  eventually  dis-
appears.  Hemoglobin  in  the  red  blood
cells  is  responsible  for  the  red-purple
color  of  the  bruise.  The  two  natural

cause  the  color  alteration  in  a  bruise.
Hemoglobin  breaks  down  to  biliverdin
(green), which in turn is metabolized to
bilirubin (yellow) (Fig. 21-5).

When  performing  a  cosmetic  proce-
dure with possible bleeding, it is helpful
to ask patients about any history of bleed-
ing  disorders  or  usage  of  anticoagulant
medications. It is also important to advise
patients  to  avoid  certain  medications  10
days prior to the procedure (Table 21-3).
A  list  of  these  medications  and  supple-
ments should be reviewed over the phone
and faxed or mailed to the patient at the
time  the  appointment  is  made  so  that
when  they  arrive  at  their  appointment,

they  will  not  have  taken  any  of  these
products.  This  practice  will  greatly
decrease  the  amount  of  bruising  that
occurs if the staff is methodical about this
warning. NSAIDs including ASA are well
recognized  for  their  antiplatelet  effects.
Other  supplements  such  as  garlic  and
ginkgo  are  also  known  for  inhibitory
effects on platelets.1 In addition, green tea
enhances  the  tendency  to  bleed  by
antiplatelet activity.2 Vitamin E appears to
exert  its  bleeding  effect  by  inhibition  of
the intrinsic coagulation pathway.3

Bruising  may  also  be  prevented  or
treated  by  using  certain  herbal  supple-
ments  such  as  bromelain  and  arnica,
which will be discussed briefly.

Bromelain

Bromelain is a substance naturally present
in  mature  pineapple  stem  (Ananas  como-
sus) and contains proteolytic enzymes.4,5
Over the years it has been used in med-
ical settings for its antithrombotic, fibri-
nolytic,  and  anti-inflammatory  effects.6
It  is  believed  that  bromelain  exerts  its
anticoagulant  activity  via  inhibition  of
platelet  aggregation.7 Pirotta  and  De
Guili-Morghen explained the fibrinolytic
activity of bromelain in rats by activating
plasminogen  conversion  to  plasmin.8
Bromelain  has  also  been  shown  to
decrease  vascular  permeability  by
levels  of  bradykinin,
lowering  the 
resulting  in  decreased  edema,  pain,  and
inflammation.9 There is no standard rec-
ommended dose for bromelain consump-
tion. Bromelain has been used in different
doses  ranging  from  200  to  2000  mg.6 In
treating human osteoarthritis, bromelain
has  been  used  in  doses  anywhere  from
540  to  1890  mg/d  with  successful
results.10–12 Bromelain is considered safe;
however,  a  higher  incidence  of  adverse
events  (e.g.,  headache,  gastrointestinal
symptoms,  and  cutaneous  rash)  have
been  observed  with  higher  doses.13
Notably, bromelain should not be recom-
mended  to  patients  on  anticoagulant
medications, such as warfarin and aspirin,
prior  to  consulting  their  primary  care
physicians.  Most  cosmetic  dermatology
practices  recommend  bromelain  500  mg
twice a day for 1 day following a proce-
dure  to  prevent  bruising,  or  if  bruising
occurs, 500 mg twice a day until the bruis-
ing has cleared. Bromlelain should not be
taken prior to the procedure because in the
author’s  experience  it  seems  to  increase
bruising rather than prevent it.

Arnica

Arnica, also known as leopard’s bane or
mountain tobacco, is an extract derived
from several mountain plants, including
Arnica montana, Arnica chamissonis, Arnica
fulgens, Arnica cordifolia, and Arnica sororia.
It  is  widely  used  in  homeopathic  prac-
tice because arnica contains helenalin, a
sesquiterpene  lactone  that  is  the  major
active ingredient conferring anti-inflam-
matory  effects.14 Helenalin  has  been
shown to inhibit the activation of NF-(cid:11)B
in  T  cells,  B  cells,  and  epithelial  cells;14
NF-(cid:11)B is considered a transcription fac-
tor  of  several  cytokines.15 The  exact
mechanism  of  action  of  arnica  in  the
treatment of bruises remains unknown;
however,  it  has  been  proposed  that
arnica affects platelet function in vitro.16
The clinical trials for treatment of ecchy-
moses  with  arnica  are  conflicting.  In  a
study of 200 patients who underwent a
wisdom tooth removal or apicoectomy,
subjects  received  arnica  3  days  prior  to
the procedure and twice daily after the
procedure in case of edema. A 90% suc-
cess  rate  with  no  swelling  or  ecchy-
moses  was  reported.  However,  this
study  lacked  a  blinded  control  group.
Alonso et al. evaluated 19 patients with
facial telangiectasia in a double-blinded,
study.17
placebo-controlled 
Subjects  were  divided  into  pre-  and
posttreatment  groups  for  treatment 
with pulsed dye laser. The pretreatment
group  received  topical  arnica  gel  with
vehicle on one side and vehicle only on
the  other  side  of  the  face  for  2  weeks
prior  to  laser  treatment.  The  posttreat-
ment group followed the same regimen
after the laser procedure. No statistically

significant differences were noted in the
prevention or accelerated clearing of the
ecchymoses.18 However, this study used
a  homeopathic  formulation  of  arnica
that  contained  very  low  amounts  of
arnica.  It  is  possible  that  a  formulation
with  a  higher  amount  of  arnica  would
have  showed  success.  Another  multi-
center, 
randomized,  double-blind,
placebo-controlled study of 130 patients
with phlebectomy also failed to show a
difference  among  patients  treated  with
arnica  (pre-  and  postprocedure)  com-
pared  to  the  control  group.19 However,
in the author’s experience, bruising seems
to  be  prevented  when  the  patient  is
advised to take four homeopathic arnica
pills  labeled  “with  30x  dilution”  4  to  6
hours  prior  to  a  cosmetic  procedure.
High doses of oral arnica can be harmful,
so  patients  should  be  warned  not  to
exceed this dose. Some people are sensi-
tive to the compound helenalin found in
arnica.  If  they  as  develop  a  mild  rash,
they  are  likely  helenalin-sensitive  and
should stop using arnica. In the author’s
practice,  arnica  gel  is  applied  to  the
treated area after every cosmetic proce-
dure. It is used to massage patients after
Sculptra  treatments  (see  Chapter  23).
Patients  are  instructed  to  apply  the
arnica  creams  3  times  a  day  at  home
until bruises clear. Donell Super Skin K-
Derm Gel and Boiron Arnica Cream are
popular brands of topical arnica that are
easily  found  in  pharmacies  and  mass
market outlets.

SUMMARY

Although bruising may be prevented by
certain techniques in dermatologic prac-
tice, bruises are considered an inevitable
side  effect  of  injectable  procedures.
Therefore,  it  is  incumbent  upon  the
practitioner to inform the patient of this
minor  side  effect.  Patients  need  to  be
aware  that  bruises  may  take  approxi-
mately 7 to 14 days to clear, so they can
make  appropriate  adjustments  to  their
schedules.

Botulinum Toxin

Leslie Baumann, MD
Mohamed L. Elsaie, MD
Lisa Grunebaum, MD

Botulinum toxin (BTX), an exotoxin pro-
duced  by  the  bacteria  Clostridium  botu-
linum, occurs  naturally  in  nature.  BTX
induces a bilaterally symmetric descend-
ing neuroparalytic condition called botu-
lism.  The  word  “botulinum”  is  derived
from the Latin word for sausage, “botu-
lus.” Botulism was so named during the
Napoleonic  Empire  in  the  early  1800s
when it was noted to be triggered by the
ingestion  of  spoiled  sausages.  Later,
German  physician 
Justinus  Kerner
described  food-borne  botulism  and  its
clinical  symptoms  during  the  period
between  1817  and  1822.  In  1946,
Schantz  reported  isolating  BTX  type  A
in its crystalline form, and nearly a quar-
ter of a century later, Alan Scott became
the first to harness the effects of BTX for
medicinal use in monkey strabismus.1

The  use  of  C.  botulinum A  exotoxin,
commonly  known  as  botulinum  toxin
type  A  (BTX-A),  has  emerged  over  the
last  decade  as  one  of  the  most  popular
methods of combating cutaneous signs of
aging, particularly the dynamic wrinkles
of  the  face.  The  therapeutic  application
of  this  potent  neurotoxin  has  carved  a
comfortable niche in the cosmetic realm
of dermatology practice for practical rea-
sons: Results appear within several days
of administration, the procedure itself is
short  in  duration  and  relatively  uncom-
plicated, and side effects are minimal.

Although  medicinal  use  of  BTX  by
physicians  is  widespread,  professional
opinions  vary  as  to  the  best  ways  to
administer the treatment. For instance, the
ideal dilution of the toxin, the number of
units  to  inject,  and  the  longevity  of  pre-
pared  and  refrigerated  BTX  remain
debated  issues  (Box  22-1).  The  methods
described  in  this  chapter  are  those  used
most  frequently  by  the  primary  author.
The novice injector should try the various
methods  espoused  by  experienced  spe-
cialists to determine which yields the best
results in his/her own practice.

MECHANISMS OF ACTION

Acetylcholine  (ACh)  is  the  neurotrans-
mitter associated with induction of mus-

BOX 22-1 Units of Botulinum Toxin

One unit (U) of BTX is the dose that would be
lethal to 50% (LD50) of the speciﬁc mouse
species tested. For a 70-kg person, the
LD50 of Botox is 2500 to 3000 U. However,
manufacturers use different mouse mod-
els, so a unit of one brand is not equivalent
to a unit of another brand. Because of
these variations, it is important to know
which type of BTX was used when evaluat-
ing dosing information in the literature. For
cosmetic indications, injection of approxi-
mately 20 to 75 U doses of Botox is typi-
cal. Practitioners have used doses as high
as 1000 Botox units to treat cerebral palsy
and other neurologic conditions.

cle  movement.  BTX  achieves  chemical
denervation  of  striated  muscles  by
cleaving  one  or  more  of  the  proteins
required for the release of ACh (Fig. 22-1).
The  target  protein  depends  on  the
serotype of toxin used (Table 22-1). The
result  is  temporary  flaccid  paralysis  of
the  injected  muscles,  which  persists
approximately  3  to  5  months.  As  new
neuromuscular  junctions  form,  muscle
function  returns.  There  are  seven  BTX
serotypes (A–G). Serotype A is the most
potent  and  was  the  first  to  be  made

available  in  the  United  States  for  med-
ical  use.  Botox  Cosmetic™  (Allergan
Inc.,  Irvine,  CA)  and  Dysport™  (Ipsen
Products,  Maidenhead,  Berkshire,  UK)
are both formed from serotype A, which
functions by cleaving the SNAP-25 pro-
tein,  a  component  of  the  SNARE
(Soluble  N-ethylmaleamide-sensitive
factor  Attachment  protein  Receptor)
complex (Box 22-2). The presence of an
intact  SNARE  complex,  composed  of
synaptobrevin,  SNAP-25,  and  syntaxin,
is necessary for vesicles containing ACh
to  fuse  with  the  cell  membrane  and  to
release  ACh  into  the  neuromuscular
junction  (Fig.  22-1).  BTX-B,  now  avail-
able in the United States as Myobloc™
(known  as  Neurobloc 
in  Europe),
cleaves  synaptobrevin,  thus  preventing
the release of ACh.

BOX 22-2 Composition of Botulinum
Toxin

BTX is composed of three domains: the bind-
ing domain, the translocation domain, and
the enzymatic domain. The binding
domain is responsible for attaching to the
presynaptic nerve terminal. (These recep-
tors are speciﬁc to each BTX serotype and
the serotypes do not bind to each other’s
acceptors.) Binding of the toxin initiates
endocytosis and internalization of the mol-
ecule. Once inside the endosome, the
acidic environment is believed to create a
change in the conformation of the translo-
cation domain of the toxin that allows the
light chain to cross the membrane of the
endosome and enter the cytosol.2 Once
released into the cytosol, the enzymatic
domain residing in the light chain cleaves
a protein in the SNARE complex that inac-
tivates this complex, preventing the fusion
of ACh vesicles and blocking release of
ACh into the synaptic cleft. The speciﬁc
cleaved SNARE complex protein depends
on the BTX serotype. BTX-A cleaves the
SNAP-25 molecule at the peptide bond
between glutamine 197 and arginine 198
and BTX-B cleaves synaptobrevin
between the amino acid residues gluta-
mine 76 and phenylalanine 77.3
Interestingly, tetanus toxin also cleaves
synaptobrevin, but uses a different
enzyme.

CLINICAL INDICATIONS

In the 1970s, Dr. Alan Scott became the
first scientist to use BTX to treat strabis-
mus in monkeys. Within 7 years, he had
performed  the  first  human  trials.4
Subsequently,  ophthalmologists  began
using  BTX  to  treat  strabismus,  nystag-
mus, and blepharospasm.5,6 In 1990, the
first paper reporting the use of BTX for
cosmetic  purposes  was  published.7
Since  that  time,  the  use  of  BTX  has
become  increasingly  widespread  and  is
currently  the  most  popular  nonsurgical
cosmetic  procedure,  with  2.78  million
injections  performed  in  2007.8 The  use
of Botox Cosmetic in the United States
grew  by  4159.2%  from  1997  to  2007
despite the fact that the FDA had yet to
approve of its use for cosmetic purposes
until halfway through this period!7,8

The cosmetic indications for BTX cur-
rently include the prevention and treat-
ment of dynamic wrinkles (wrinkles “in
motion”)  and  amelioration  of  excessive
sweating  (hyperhidrosis).  BTX  is  also
used to ameliorate platysmal banding in

the  neck,  which  leads  to  a  condition
commonly  known  as  “turkey  neck.”
Some  practitioners  have  also  obtained
satisfactory  results  in  treating  the  signs
of aging in the lower face.9,10 New indi-
cations are frequently reported.

BOTULINUM TOXIN TYPE A

Botox Cosmetic

Initially  introduced  as  Botox™,  this
product was first used for cosmetic pur-
poses in 1981. Botox Cosmetic, still usu-
ally referred to as Botox, was approved
by  the  FDA  in  2002  for  treatment  of
(glabellar)  frown  lines.  Botox  is  formed
from fermented cultures of C. botulinum.
The  cultures  are  subjected  to  autolysis,
releasing a 900 kD toxic complex. Prior
to  placement  in  storage  vials,  the  com-
pound  is  diluted  with  human  serum
albumin. The manufacturers then freeze
dry and seal the toxin. One vial of Botox
contains 100 U of BTX-A.

DILUTION AND STORAGE Physicians do not
agree  on  the  optimal  dilution  ratio  for
the  toxin  or  on  how  long  the  toxin
retains 
its  potency  after  dilution.
However,  Klein  published  a  survey  of
expert Botox users and found that most
of them use a dilution of 2.5 cc per 100-
U  vial.11 This  dilution  was  used  in  the
Allergan  FDA  trials  as  well.  Reports  in
the literature support the use of 1 cc to
10 cc dilutions.11 See Table 22-2 for dilu-
tion guidelines.

The  100-U  bottle  of  Botox  is  diluted
with  0.9%  saline.  Preservative-free
saline  was  recommended  initially  until
studies  showed  that  pain  perception
was  decreased  when  preservative-
containing  saline  was  used.12 When
diluting the bottle, care must be taken to
gently inject the saline into the bottle to
prevent  foaming  and  bubbles,  which
may denature the toxin and decrease its
potency.  Many  physicians  remove  the

rubber stopper before adding the saline,
which  prevents  the  rapid  addition  of
saline  to  the  bottle  because  of  the  vac-
uum of the bottle and helps avoid leav-
ing a few expensive drops of BTX-A in
the vial. Novice practitioners should be
advised to never insert the needle of the
syringe  that  is  to  be  used  for  injection
into  the  rubber  stopper.  This  would
make  it  dull  and  increase  the  pain  on
injection. In addition, it is important not
to shake the bottle or “flick” the syringe
to  eliminate  air  bubbles  as  agitation  of
the toxin may lead to loss of potency.

Once  the  BTX-A  has  been  diluted
with  saline,  it  begins  to  lose  potency,
but  the  point  at  which  the  potency
losses  become  clinically  significant  is
unknown.  Many  authors  suggest  that
BTX-A should be used within 48 hours;
however, a few authors state that Botox
may  remain  in  the  refrigerator  up  to  4
weeks.13 If one plans to keep Botox for
an  extended  period  of  time,  preserva-
tive-containing  saline  should  be  used
and  the  reconstituted  Botox  should  be
kept  in  a  refrigerator.  In  the  primary
author’s  experience,  the  best  Botox  is
“fresh” Botox and should be used within
24  hours  of  dilution.  Botox  should  not
be  refrozen  once  prepared  as  this  also
causes a definite loss of potency, due to
the formation of ice crystals.

Reloxin/Dysport

Dysport  is  sold  in  bottles  containing 
500  U  of  BTX-A.  Dysport  will  be  mar-
keted in the United States as Reloxin™.
Medicis  Pharmaceutical  Corporation,
which  will  manufacture  and  distribute
Reloxin in the United States, was await-
ing FDA approval for this product at the
time  of  publication.  Because  Reloxin  is
simply  the  American  brand  name  for
Dysport,  which  is  produced  in  the
United  Kingdom,  the  terms  are  inter-
changeable.  Reloxin  will  be  the  term
used for the remainder of this portion of
the discussion. Similar to Botox, the neu-
rotoxin  is  produced  from  C.  botulinum.
One unit of Botox is equivalent to 2.5 to
4 U of Reloxin.14,15 The units and dilution
must be adjusted accordingly. Reloxin is
manufactured as freeze-dried 500-U vials
and preserved as a powder. One bottle of
Botox  contains  5  ng  of  protein  while  a
vial of Reloxin contains 4.35 ng.16

DILUTION  AND  STORAGE The  shelf  life
of the packaged Reloxin vial is approx-
imately  1  year,  if  refrigerated  at  2  to
8(cid:2)C.17 The vial should be used within 
24  hours  of  reconstitution,  for  the

same  reasons  that  this  is  recom-
mended  with  Botox.  Reloxin  can  be
diluted with 0.9% preservative-free or
preservative-containing  saline  as  sug-
gested  in  Table  22-3.  Using  a  dilution
with  2.5  mL  provides  20  U  of  Reloxin
per  0.1  mL.  Reconstituted  Reloxin
should not be frozen.

A series of separate studies on glabellar
lines were carried out at major cosmetic
centers across the United States in order
to  assess  the  efficacy,  tolerability,  and
safety of Reloxin prior to FDA approval.
In  two  parallel  groups  of  placebo-con-
trolled  double-blinded  studies  including
300  and  158  patients,  respectively,  sub-
jects were randomized to either Reloxin
(50  U)  or  placebo.  The  study  durations
were  respectively  150  and  180  days.
Based on visual response scales assessed
by investigators and patients, both stud-
ies  concluded  that  at  30  days  postinjec-
tion, Reloxin significantly reached study-
designed improvement endpoints in 90%
of  patients  and  reduced  the  severity  of
glabellar  lines  significantly  better  than
placebo (p(cid:3) 0.001). The median time of
onset  was  either  2  or  3  days  for  both
studies.  The  median  duration  of  effect
was  85  days,  with  significant  efficacy
through day 120.18

A larger multicenter open-label study
was carried out in 21 centers across the
United States and enrolled 1200 patients
over  a  13-month  duration.  Reloxin 
(50  U)  was  used  for  glabellar  lines  to
assess  effectiveness  and  duration.
Results  suggested  an  onset  of  action
within 3 days and a median duration of
88  days  for  effect.  In  all  series,  Reloxin
was  deemed  safe  with  negligible
adverse effects.19 Reloxin performs simi-
larly to Botox and is injected in the same
sites  and  manner  as  Botox.  It  is  impor-
tant  to  remember  that  the  dose  of
Reloxin  is  different  than  the  dose  of
Botox;  otherwise,  these  are  virtually
identical products.

introduced 

uct  containing  only  the  150  kDa  neuro-
toxin component. The smaller size of this
compound may increase its diffusion rates;
however,  this  has  not  been  clearly  estab-
in
lished.  Xeomin  was 
Germany  in  2005  and  is  not  currently
available  in  other  European  countries  or
the  United  States.  It  is  manufactured  as
100-U vials. Merz Pharmaceuticals claims
that the product is highly purified and con-
tains  only  600  pg  of  bacterial  proteins,20
which  may  result  in  lower  immune
response. In addition, Xeomin differs from
Botox and Reloxin in one of its constituent
elements.  While  Botox  and  Reloxin  con-
tain  sodium  chloride  and  lactose,  respec-
tively,  Xeomin  contains  saccharose.  The
clinical conversion rate of Botox to Xeomin
is  reported  as  1:1.21 A  number  of  major
studies conducted and reported by Jost et
al. demonstrated equal efficacy and safety
profiles  of  Xeomin  in  the  treatment  of
focal dystonias as compared to Botox. The
five clinical trials involved 862 patients and
found  no  difference  between  the  two
BTX-A toxins in terms of onset of action,
duration,  or  waning  of  effect.22 Further
research  is  needed  to  evaluate  efficacy  in
cosmetic  dermatology  and  antigenic
response of this product.

NEURONOX Neuronox® is a BTX-A com-
plex  manufactured  by  Medy-Tox,  Inc.
(Seoul,  South  Korea).  Neuronox  was
introduced  in  South  Korea  and  is  cur-
rently  available  in  Asia,  the  Middle
East,  and  Africa.  It  is  manufactured  as
100-U  vials  of  neurotoxin  along  with
0.5  mg  of  human  serum  albumin  and
0.9 mg of sodium chloride. The conver-
sion  rate  of  Neuronox  to  Botox  is
reported  to  be  1:1.  The  manufacturers
of Neuronox claim that their product is
safe  and  effective;  however,  efficacy,
tolerability, and safety needs to be eval-
uated by further well-designed research
investigations.23

PROSIGNE Prosigne® (Lanzhou  Institute
of Biological Products, Lanzhou, China)
is  a  BTX-A  product  available  in  China,
Southeast  Asia,  and  certain  parts  of
South America. The product is manufac-
tured as 50- and 100-U vials. There is a
lack  of  evidence  regarding  the  clinical
efficacy  and  safety  of  Prosigne  for  the
treatment of focal dystonias and hemifa-
cial  spasm.  Evidence  is  also  lacking  in
terms of ascertaining the precise role of
Prosigne in the cosmetic realm. To date,
only  two  studies  have  evaluated  this
product. Tang et al. retrospectively stud-
ied 785 patients with hemifacial spasm
and  various  types  of  focal  dystonias,

including  blepharospasm  to  compare
Prosigne with Botox. They found no sig-
nificant  differences  between  the  two
preparations  and  found  an  equivalence
ratio  of  1:1.5  between  Botox  and
Prosigne.24 In the other study, Rieder et
al.  evaluated  28  patients  using  equiva-
lent  units  of  Botox  and  Prosigne.  They
demonstrated  similar  results  with  both
drugs,  suggesting  a  direct  bioequiva-
lence.  Because  of  the  discrepancy
between  the  two  studies,  which  could
be due to heterogeneity of patients and
methods of sampling, further research is
needed in this area to accurately estab-
lish  the  bioequivalence  of  Prosigne  in
comparison  to  other  BTX-A  prepara-
tions.25

BOTULINUM TOXIN TYPE B

Myobloc

Myobloc™ 
(Solstice  Neurosciences,
South San Francisco, CA) received FDA
approval for use in the United States in
December  2000.  Myobloc  is  composed
of  BTX-B,  which  acts  by  cleaving  the
protein  synaptobrevin  preventing  ACh
release in the synaptic cleft. The drug is
available in a ready-to-use formula that
does  not  require  reconstitution,  but  it
should be kept refrigerated. Myobloc is
stable for up to 21 months in refrigerator
storage.  This  product  is  available  in
three-vial  configurations  of  2500,  5000,
and  10,000  U,  with  a  composition  of
5000 U BTX-B/mL. Once the bottle has
been opened, Myobloc begins to lose its
potency. A physician who performs few
Myobloc injections per week can opt to
use a smaller size bottle to avoid wast-
ing the residual toxin, thus ensuring that
the toxin is as potent as possible.

The FDA has approved Myobloc for
the  treatment  of  cervical  dystonia;
however,  its  use  in  cosmetics  has  not
yet been approved. Phase III clinical tri-
als of the drug for the treatment of cer-
vical  dystonia  reported  a  12-  to  16-
week duration of effect. In a study by
Baumann  et  al.,  20  patients  were
treated  for  crow’s  feet  with  Myobloc
and  the  maximum  efficacy  was  deter-
mined to be at day 30, with the effect
beginning  to  dissipate  at  a  mean  of
67.5 days.26

Approximately  50  U  of  Myobloc  are
equivalent  to  1  U  of  Botox.  Although
Myobloc  is  shipped  in  a  reconstituted
form,  preservative-free  saline  may  be
added to change the amount of units in
0.1  cc.  When  diluting  a  bottle  of
Myobloc,  it  is  important  to  recognize

DIFFUSION CHARACTERISTICS 
OF BOTULINUM TOXINS

With the emergence of different brands
of  botulinum  toxins,  differences  in
preparations  and  effects  need  to  be
assessed for optimal patient benefit with
minimal  complications.  Although  the
various BTX preparations have very sim-
ilar results, there are a few differences to
take  into  account.  Diffusion  rates  may
result  in  different  “fields  of  effects”  or
surface area affected by the toxin.

The diffusion potential of botulinum
neurotoxins  and  their  migration  is
dependent on a number of factors such
as  the  size  and  structure  of  the  mole-
cule,27 the subtype of the toxin,28,29 the
volume of injections,30 the protein load
and  the  formulation’s  excipient  con-
tent,31 and  finally  on  the  muscle  and
site  of  injection.19 The  field  of  effects
or diffusion of BTX-A and BTX-B have
been  characterized  and  targeted  in  a
few  studies  concerned  with  their
extent of diffusion and potential com-
plications.

Myobloc  appears  to  have  a  greater
field  of  effect  than  Botox.  One  study
compared  the  radius  of  diffusion  of
Myobloc to Botox in eight patients with
moderate  to  severe  forehead  wrinkles.
Patients were injected with 5 U of Botox
on one side of their frontalis muscle and
with 500 U of Myobloc to the other side
(1:100  Botox:Myobloc  conversion  rate).
The  field  of  effect  of  Myobloc  was
assessed  using  a  digital  micrometer  on
traced  scanned  images  and  demon-
strated  a  higher  diffusion.32 In  another
comparative  study  of  Botox  and
Myobloc, Matarasso showed that treat-

ing  crow’s  feet  with  Myobloc  produces
more sensation of tightness and freezing
in  comparison  to  Botox  and  he  specu-
lated  that  the  observation  is  caused  by
increased  Myobloc  diffusion.33 An
increased field of effect may be advanta-
geous in that it would allow fewer injec-
tion  points  to  produce  the  same  effect.
This is particularly beneficial when treat-
ing  hyperhidrosis  of  the  palms,  where
the pain of injection is significant. In fact,
in  the  primary  author’s  experience,
Myobloc is the most efficacious toxin in
the  treatment  of  hyperhidrosis  because
of the greater amount of diffusion.34

Reloxin/Dysport  may  also  have  a
greater  field  of  effect  than  Botox.  In  a
recent study, the diffusions of Botox and
Dysport  were  compared  in  20  patients
with  forehead  hyperhidrosis.35 Patients
were  randomly  injected  with  3  U  of
Botox  or  Dysport  (conversion  rate  of
1:2.5, 1:3, and 1:4 correlating to 7.5, 9, or
12 U) in four areas of the forehead. The
injection  volume  was  consistent  in  all
treatments.  The  anhidrotic  area  was
assessed by using the starch-iodine test.
Subjects  who  received  Dysport  had  a
significantly  higher  mean  area  of
anhidrosis  on  their  forehead  as  com-
pared  to  patients  treated  with  Botox.
Another study compared 12 healthy vol-
unteers who were randomly assigned to
receive  three  0.1  mL  intradermal  injec-
tions in their forehead: 4 U Botox on one
side,  12  U  Dysport  (conversion  rate  of
1:3) on the contralateral side, and saline
in  the  center.  The  anhidrotic  area  was
assessed by using the starch-iodine test.
A  higher  mean  area  of  anhidrosis  was
observed  in  11  of  the  12  subjects  who
received  Dysport  and  the  authors  con-
cluded that Dysport has a higher migra-
tion  potential  than  Botox.36 A  higher
migration  potential  would  likely  result
in fewer injections required in a treated
area.  (Box  22-3 for  a  brief  discussion
related to the number of injections and
the  business  aspects  of  these  treat-
ments.)  This  would  be  beneficial  in

BOX 22-3 The Business Side of
Botulinum Toxin

The amount of BTX needed per site depends

on the musculature of the individual
patient. Therefore, BTX should be priced
by the number of units used and not by
the area treated. When using a consistent
dilution technique, one can charge by the
number of units used. The price per unit
varies geographically. The patient should
understand that additional injections (and
charges) may occur at the next visit
because individual musculature varies. In
other words, if you charge by the number
of units, you will likely need to charge for
touch-ups as well.

areas  such  as  the  crow’s  feet,  where
bruising  from  the  needle  is  common.
More  studies  need  to  be  performed  to
determine if an increased field of effect
provides  an  advantage.  Xeomin  is  the
smallest  of  the  BTX-A  preparations
because  it  is  composed  of  the  neuro-
toxin component alone and not the sur-
rounding complexing proteins.20 For this
reason,  it  may  diffuse  more  than  the
other  BTX-A  preparations.  More
research is necessary to determine how
much diffusion is preferred for cosmetic
indications.

CLINICAL USES

Dynamic Wrinkles

BTX can be injected into specific mus-
cles  to  induce  temporary  paralysis
resulting  in  an  inability  to  move  and
wrinkle  the  skin  overlying  the  treated
muscle.  BTX  is  only  beneficial  for
dynamic  wrinkles,  also  known  as
“wrinkles in motion.” It is not as effec-
tive  for  static  wrinkles  (“wrinkles  at
rest”),  although  prolonged  use  of  BTX
may  help  prevent  wrinkles  in  motion
from  becoming  wrinkles  at  rest.  BTX
can  be  combined  with  dermal  fillers
(Chapter  23)  and  resurfacing  tech-
niques (Chapter 24) to optimize patient
satisfaction. The upper part of the face
contains  distinct  muscle  groups  that
can  be  selectively  paralyzed  by  a
knowledgeable  injector.  In  the  lower
part of the face, the muscle groups are
less  distinct  and  thus  more  difficult  to
inject  accurately  (Fig.  22-2).  The  para-
lytic  effects  of  BTX  appear  approxi-
mately  3  to  7  days  after  injection.
However,  the  effects  may  increase  for
up to 2 weeks.

the muscles in the lower face.

The  injection  sites  for  female  and
male patients are shown in Fig. 22-6. In
men or patients with stronger muscula-
ture, two sites superior to the corruga-
tor  muscle  may  need  to  be  injected

(Fig. 22-7A and B). The primary author
has  found  that  doses  of  20  U  in  the
glabella  work  for  most  men  while
retaining  a  natural  look;  one  study
showed that 40 to 60 U in the glabellar
area was more effective in males.38 The
injector should avoid the periosteum as
this can induce postinjection headache.
After  injecting  the  procerus  muscle,
massage  the  area  laterally  across  the
bridge  of  the  nose  to  ensure  that  the
toxin  enters  the  depressor  supercilii
portion  of  the  corrugator  muscle  (Fig.

patient’s  medial  brow,  resulting  in  a
more  youthful  appearance.  Proper
treatment  of  the  glabellar  area  or
“brow  furrow”  prevents  the  patient
from  frowning,  leading  to  a  more
relaxed, less angry look (Fig. 22-9A and
B).  In  addition,  relaxation  of  these
muscles  for  long  periods  of  time  may
prevent or reduce wrinkle formation in
the brow area.

FOREHEAD  REGION BTX-A  is  clinically
used more broadly than its FDA indica-
tion  of  glabellar  treatment.  Expanded
use is permissible for licensed physicians
and  is  referred  to  as  “off  label”  use.  To
treat wrinkles of the forehead, inject 0.1
cc  (4  U  Botox,  200  U  Myobloc)  across
the 
in 
forehead  as  demonstrated 
Figs.  22-10 and 22-11.  Injection  of  the
forehead is an art as well as a science as
it  can  dramatically  affect  eyebrow
shape.  Therefore,  prior  to  injecting  the

To  use  Botox,  dilute  the  100-U  vial
with  2.5  cc  of  preservative-free  saline.
This  yields  4  U  per  0.1  cc.  To  use
Reloxin/Dysport,  dilute  the  500-U  vial
with  2.5  mL  of  0.9%  preservative-free
saline. This provides 20 U per 0.1 mL. To
use Myobloc, dilute a 2500-U vial with
1.2 cc of saline. This yields 200 U per 0.1
cc.  Inject  with  a  1-cc  syringe  and  a  30-
gauge needle.

GLABELLAR REGION To treat the glabellar
region, inject 0.1 cc (4 U of Botox or 200
U Myobloc) into each corrugator muscle
along with 0.1 cc into the procerus mus-
cle  (Figs.  22-3 to 22-5).  Glabellar  injec-
tions  are  currently  the  only  injections
approved by the FDA for cosmetic use.
The glabellar indication is also the only
one under consideration by the FDA for
Reloxin.  Rzany  et  al.  studied  the  effect
of Dysport in a double-blinded placebo-
controlled  study  of  221  subjects  with
glabellar lines. Participants were injected
with  30  U,  50  U,  or  placebo  in  the
glabellar  area  and  followed  for  16
weeks.  After  4  weeks,  there  was  little
statistical  difference  between  the  treat-
ment groups. The response rate among
the 30- and 50-U receivers compared to
placebo  was  86.1%  versus  18.9%  and
86.3% versus 7.9%, respectively.37

forehead, the physician should consider
whether  she/he  wants  to  enhance  the
arch  of  the  eyebrow  to  create  a  more
horizontal  eyebrow  shape.  Generally,
women  prefer  a  more  arched  brow
because it imparts a more feminine look,
while  men  prefer  a  more  horizontal
brow (Table 22-5). The forehead should
be injected about every two square cen-
timeters  where  movement  of  the  mus-
cles  is  seen  on  eyebrow  elevation.  It  is
important not to inject all patients in the
same  way.  Forehead  injections  should
be  tailored  or  customized  to  the
patient’s  forehead  size  and  shape.  In
addition, one must take into considera-
tion the placement of the eyebrow over
the superior orbital rim. Low brows will
become  even  lower  after  injections  of
BTX  to  the  forehead;  therefore,  fore-
head  injections  should  be  avoided  in
some  patients.  Alternately,  injections
can  be  performed  in  the  higher  regions
of  the  forehead  in  patients  with  low
brows. Use the recommendations in this
chapter  as  rough  guidelines  and  vary
injection technique to suit the needs of
each  individual  patient’s  anatomy.  The
major  pitfalls  with  forehead  injections
are  the  following:  (1)  unwanted  eye-
brow  shape (Fig.  22-12),  (2)  brow  pto-
sis,  (3)  missed  areas  (Figs.  22-13 and 
22-14),  and  (4)  drooping  eyelids.  It  is
important not to overinject the forehead
area  as  this  may  lead  to  brow  ptosis.
Additionally,  one  must  take  care  to
avoid the area 1 cm above the eyebrows
to  reduce  the  chances  of  brow  ptosis
(Fig. 22-15). The physician should warn
the patient with low forehead wrinkles
within  this  1-cm  area  that  these  wrin-
kles  cannot  be  treated  with  BTX,  and
will  remain  after  treatment  as  demon-
strated  in  Figs.  22-16 and 22-17.  Care
must  be  taken  to  avoid  forehead  injec-
tions in individuals with low-set brows
and/or  excessive  eyelid  skin.  In  older
patients and patients with excess eyelid
skin, overtreatment of the forehead area
may result in drooping eyelids. Hooding
of  the  upper  eyelids  by  the  descending
eyebrow tissue results in a neural reflex

that increases the activity of the frontalis
muscle  in  an  effort  to  keep  the  vision
clear of the descending tissue that would
otherwise  obstruct  vision  or  interfere
with  eyelid  function.39 In  this  popula-
tion the upward pulling of the frontalis
muscle  is  needed  to  raise  the  baggy
upper eye skin. These patients are better
treated  with  blepharoplasty  first,  then
with  BTX.  The  ideal  patient  for  BTX
treatment  in  the  forehead  is  a  young
patient  (20s–40s)  with  no  excess  upper
eyelid skin (Figs. 22-18 and 22-19).

CROW’S  FEET To  treat  crow’s  feet  with
Botox,  inject  0.1  cc  1  cm  lateral  to  the
lateral canthus. Then inject 0.05 cc 1 cm
above the first injection and 0.1 cc 1 cm
below as shown in Figs. 22-20 and 22-21.
If  wrinkles  progress  medially,  one  can
inject 0.05 cc approximately 1 cm apart
along  the  orbital  rim  to  the  midpupil-
lary  line.  When  using  Dysport,  fewer
injection sites may be required because
of increased diffusion. Injecting medial
to  the  midpupillary  line  does  not  cor-
rect medial wrinkles and can lead to an
ectropion;  therefore,  this  area  should
be avoided. Most patients do not notice
these  wrinkles  prior  to  BTX  injections
and sometimes mistakenly believe that
BTX  “caused”  these  previously  unob-
served  wrinkles.  When  used  properly,
BTX  can  temporarily  erase  the  lateral
crow’s feet lines (Fig. 22-22).

BROW LIFT AND THE 
MICRODROPLET TECHNIQUE

BTX  has  been  used  to  elevate  the  eye-
brow  position  by  treating  between  the
eyebrows as well as the lateral eyebrow
with relatively few injection sites,23 and
with  relatively  large  quantities  of  BTX
(1.5–2.5  U  BTX-A).40 This  technique  is
limited by the possibility of inducing the
undesired  side  effect  of  upper  eyelid
ptosis caused by the unwanted diffusion
of BTX into the levator palpebrae supe-
rioris  muscle,  which  is  responsible  for
eyelid elevation.41

The  position  and  appearance  of  the
eyebrows  is  determined  at  rest  and
dynamically  by  the  opposing  action  of
several groups of muscles that act on the
eyebrow. The frontalis muscle primarily
performs  eyebrow  elevation.  Brow  ele-
vation  is  opposed  by  the  septal  and
orbital  portions  of  the  orbicularis  oculi
muscle,  including  the  depressor  super-
cilii  component  of  the  orbicularis  oculi
muscle, and the procerus muscle.42 The
medial  position  of  the  eyebrow  is  also
influenced by the activity of the corrugator

“Diablo eyebrow” as seen in B. This can be avoided or corrected by injecting 4 units of Botox 2 cm above
the lateral brow in the area of muscle movement.

supercilii  muscle.  Additionally,  the
shape  of  the  brows  is  affected  by  the
activities  of  the  eyebrow  elevators  and
the  eyebrow  depressor  muscles  where
they interdigitate along the eyebrow to
create facial expression.43 With age there
is  a  gradual  fall  in  the  position  of  the
eyebrows, which is known as brow pto-
sis,  resulting  in  smaller  appearing  eyes
that is not aesthetically desirable.

BTX  can  also  be  used  to  elevate  the
brows,  resulting  in  a  more  youthful
appearance. This has been referred to in
the  literature  as  a  chemical  brow  lift.
The  technique  of  lifting  the  brow
includes injection of the glabellar area as
described above. After injecting the pro-
cerus  muscle  with  0.1  cc  of  Botox  the
nasal  bridge  should  be  massaged  in
order to ensure that the toxin enters the
depressor supercilii portion of the corru-
gator muscle as shown in Fig. 22-8. This
can be used to try and correct an asym-
metry of the medial brow. Injecting 0.05
cc of Botox into the lateral brow depres-
sor muscles  as  shown  in  Fig.  22-23 can
raise the lateral aspect of the eyebrow.44
Ahn et al. showed that treatment of the
lateral depressors of the brow results in
an  average  brow  elevation  of  4.83  mm
when  measured  from  the  lateral  can-
thus.45 Injections  of  Botox  into  the
glabellar area and lateral brow have also
been shown to yield brow elevations of
1 to 3 mm when measured from the eye-
brow  to  the  midpupillary  point.44
However,  it  is  the  primary  author’s
experience that the lateral brow lift with
Botox  provides  inconsistent  results  and
leads  to  lateral  brow  lowering  in  some
patients. (The procerus injection consis-
tently  raises  the  brows.)  Therefore,  the
lead author prefers using a dermal filler
injected into the lateral brow to achieve
a brow lift (Chapter 23).

A  novel  technique  introduced  by
Steinsapir  is  intended  to  temporarily 
elevate the eyebrows without provoking
any undesirable side effects. This “micro-
droplet  technique”  uses  small  quantities
of  BTX  dissolved  in  microdroplets  of
injectable saline carrier to treat the septal
and  orbital  orbicularis  muscles,  on  each
side  of  the  patient’s  face.  He  treats  the
frontalis at and below the brow by inject-
ing very small volumes of fluid in multiple
locations.46 These  microdroplets  have
volumes of 10 to 50 (cid:4)L of injectable saline
containing as small as 0.001 to 1 U Botox.
Treatment is based on 100 U Botox and 3
mL  of  injectable  saline,  which  equals
approximately 0.33 U of Botox per 10 (cid:4)L.
A  typical  treatment  involves  a  total  of
approximately  100  microdroplets  placed
in double or triple rows just above, in, and

 
 
 
further  stressed  that  proper  studies
excluding  confounding  variables,  such
as concomitant rhinoplasty or chemod-
enervation  of  synergistic  muscles,  are
required  before  Botox  injection  alone
can be recommended as a treatment for
dynamic nasal tip ptosis.50 The primary
author uses 2 to 3 U injected at the base
of  the  columella.51 This  procedure  is
most effective for those with a short- or
normal-sized  upper  lip.  Those  with  a
long length between the top of the col-
umella  and  the  top  of  the  lip,  that  is,
long  upper  lip,  do  not  receive  good
results from this procedure (Fig. 22-27).
Those with a long upper lip will benefit
from a dermal filler to raise the nasal tip
(Chapter 23).

COSMETIC USE OF BOTULINUM 
TOXIN TYPE A IN THE 
LOWER FACE 

Cosmetic treatments with BTX-A have
focused mainly on the upper face, par-
ticularly  the  glabellar,  forehead,  and
periocular  areas.  With 
the  huge
increase  in  the  number  of  cosmetic
Botox  injections  delivered  each  year
and  its  clinical  effectiveness,  a  variety
of  off-label  interventions  using  BTX-A
for  the  lower  face  have  emerged.52
However,  this  area  has  an  increased
incidence  of  side  effects  and  should
only  be  treated  by  experienced  BTX
users.

As such, BTX-A is now more widely
used  in  lower  face  and  neck  rejuvena-
tion, in treating the chin and corners of
the mouth as well as in recontouring of
the  jawline.  Yet  another  area  where
BTX-A  has  shown  promise  cosmeti-
cally  is  in  the  treatment  of  facial  and
chest wall flushing. The response of the

men, this can often occur laterally in areas of hair loss, so men may need to be injected in the upper lat-
eral regions just below the receding hairline.

there  is  no  consensus  on  an  optimal
method.  The  main  muscles  that  influ-
ence  the  nasal  tip  are  the  nasalis,  the
depressor  septi  nasi,  the  levator  labii
superioris, and the alaeque nasi muscle.
Atamoros  in  2003  described  the  injec-
tion  of  4  U  of  Botox  into  each  of  the
alar portions of the nasalis and 4 U into
the  depressor  septi.48 Dayan  and
Kempiners later described the injection
of  5  U  of  Botox  into  each  depressor
septi nasi and 3 U into each levator labii
superioris.49 Ghavami  et  al.  demon-
strated  similar  results  as  Dayan  and
Kempiners with only 1 to 2 U injected
to each of the depressor septi nasi and

below  the  brow,  stopping  around  the
level of the lowest brow cilia. The micro-
droplet injections are placed superficially
approximately 1 mm into the skin to trap
the  Botox  at  the  interface  between  the
orbicularis oculi and the skin. For crow’s
feet, the needle is inserted before the mid-
line  of  the  lateral  palpebral  raphe.  The
glabellar area is also treated. The combi-
nation of these treatments produces a uni-
form brow-lift effect.14

Bunny Lines

The upper nasalis muscle across the bony
dorsum of the nose causes fanning wrin-
kles  (“bunny  lines’’)  at  the  radix  of  the
nose47 and  can  lead  to  medial  wrinkling
around  the  eyes.  Two  to  four  units  of
Botox  can  be  injected  into  the  nasalis
muscle  as  shown  to  reduce  or  eliminate
these  lines.  Many  physicians  inject  into
the  wrinkles  rather  than  into  the  nasalis
muscle resulting in an incomplete correc-
tion.  The  correct  injection  points  are  in
the  belly  of  the  muscle,  inferior  to  the
angular  vein  as  shown  in  Figs.  22-24 to
22-26. If the injection is too low, the leva-
tor labii superioris will be relaxed, which
leads to an unwanted upper lip ptosis.

Treating Nasal Tip Ptosis/Nasal 
Tip Lift

BTX has been used for lifting the nasal
tip. More than one technique exists but

and  minor  contributing  to  these  folds.
Marionette  lines  are  often  corrected  by
dermal fillers; however, some physicians
prefer  to  combine  dermal  fillers  with
BTX injections. BTX can be injected into
the  depressor  anguli  oris  to  weaken  it,
allowing the zygomaticus to elevate the
corners of the mouth and return them to
a horizontal position.10 For reducing the
melomental  folds,  a  dose  of  2  to  4  U
should  be  injected  at  the  depressor
anguli oris immediately above the angle
of the mandible and 1 cm lateral to the
lateral oral commissure.53 Care must be
taken  not  to  use  too  high  of  a  dose  as
this  can  lead  to  drooping  of  the  lateral
lower  lip,  flaccid  cheeks,  an  incompe-
tent mouth, or an asymmetric smile.

Perioral Lines

Many factors are implicated in the for-
mation of perioral lines. Smoking, pho-
toaging,  loss  of  subcutaneous  tissue  in
the lower face, and the purse string-like
action of the orbicularis oris muscles are
the  most  important  causes.  BTX-A
injection  is  usually  reserved  for  deep
perioral  lines  worsened  with  muscular

lower  facial  muscles  to  BTX-A  is
greater  than  upper  facial  muscles.
Moreover,  it  has  been  established  that
the  lower  facial  muscles  will  have  a
longer-lasting  response  to  BTX-A  than
upper facial musculature. The dose for
the lower muscles therefore needs to be
adjusted to the muscle size and patient
gender to be approximately half or one-
third  the  dose  injected  in  the  upper
facial muscles.

Upper  Gum  Show—The  levator  labii
superioris  alaeque  nasi  muscle  retracts
the  upper  lip.  In  some  individuals,  this
muscle is overactive and pulls the lip back
excessively, allowing visualization of the
upper gums and upper incisors. Injecting
1 to 2 U into the levator labii superioris
alaeque  nasi  muscle  on  each  side  of  the
bony nasal prominence will slightly drop
the lip, preventing the upper gum show.
This  procedure  works  better  in  young
patients because it causes vertical elonga-
tion of the lip. This can be used in combi-
nation with fillers such as CosmoPlast in
the vermilion border to prevent the elon-
gated lip (Fig. 22-28).

Melomental Folds

The  melomental  folds  are  also  called
marionette lines. They extend from the
downturned corner of the mouth to the

pursing of the lips. The dosage is depen-
dent on the depth of lines but generally
1  U  of  BTX-A  injected  into  each  site
with a total of 2 U per half of the upper
lips.  The  middle  upper  lip  should  be
avoided  in  patients  wanting  to  retain
their cupid bow. It is critical to measure
the placement on the upper lips first so
that the sides are treated in exactly the
same  spot  to  preserve  symmetry  (Fig.
22-29).  The  best  results  occur  when
BTX is combined with laser resurfacing
or  lip  fillers  to  enhance  the  vermillion
border  and  smooth  the  surface  of  the
skin.

Mentalis Muscle and Chin Puckering

Relaxing the hyperkinetic muscle fibers
of the chin and the mentalis muscle with
BTX-A  can  reduce  and  eliminate  chin
puckering (Fig. 22-30). A single dose of 4
to 6 U of BTX-A placed in the exact cen-
ter of the point of the chin is effective.51
An overdose in this area can result in the
inability  to  approximate  the  lower  lips
tightly against the teeth, ultimately lead-
ing to involuntary dribbling from the lip
when drinking or drooling from the cor-
ners of the mouth.54

Neck Lines and Platysma

Brandt  and  Bellman  were  the  first  to
report  using  BTX  to  treat  aging  of  the
neck.55 Platysmal bands and neck vertical
lines  represent  an  accurate  gauge  of
chronological  age  specifically  for  those
people  with  exaggerated  outdoor  sun
exposure.  Separation  of  the  platysma
anteriorly occurs with aging, resulting in
banding or “turkey neck.” Vertical platys-
mal  bands  may  be  successfully  treated
with  BTX-A.  The  extended  or  marked
platysmal  bands  are  grasped  between
the thumb and index fingers and the nee-
dle is vertically inserted into the muscle
band. The dose is usually 2 to 4 U spaced
4  cm  apart  with  an  overall  cumulative
dose  of  8  to  12  U  per  band  and  a  total
maximum  in  the  neck  of  25  to  30  U.
Because of the nature of the muscle and
the site of injection, complications such
as  dysphagia  and  dysphonia  can  be
encountered.56
should  be
warned  about  the  possibility  of  such
untoward effects.

lack  of  consensus  on  dosing  considera-
tions  for  different  skin  types  and  there
exists  a  discrepancy  regarding  which
skin type requires higher or lesser doses
for  an  optimal  response.62 Several  vari-
ables must be taken into consideration,
such as skin thickness, skin musculature,
and  circumference  of  bony  promi-
nences.  Skin  thickness  and  texture
contribute to dosing decisions. Although
the injections are generally muscular, the
thickness  of  the  dermis  might  influ-
ence the delivery technique. For instance,
some  studies  have  suggested  that  the
skin  of  Asians  tends  to  be  thicker  than
that  of  Caucasians  with  more  collagen
fibers,  which  might  demand  a  higher
dose of injection.63 However, other stud-
ies  in  Asians  have  found  that  lower
doses  may  be  needed 
in
Caucasians.64 Arimura  et  al.  evaluated
the  differences  in  the  muscle-relaxing
effect  of  BTX-B  using  electrophysio-
logic  measurements  in  48  Asian  and
Caucasian  volunteers.  They  concluded
that the muscle-relaxing effects of BTX-B
were  similar 
in  both  Asian  and
Caucasian  study  populations.65 Racial
differences  in  BTX  responses  remain
unclear.  More  studies  are  required  to
determine any potential variations in the
response of different skin types to botu-
linum  toxins.  The  primary  author  has
not  noted  any  consistent  differences
among the various ethnicities treated in
her practice.

HYPERHIDROSIS

Hyperhidrosis is a troublesome problem
leading to awkward social situations for
those  affected.  Unfortunately,  topical
and oral medications, iontophoresis, and
surgery  have  not  proven  efficacious  in
the  majority  of  patients.  The  eccrine
glands  are  innervated  by  sympathetic
nerves  that  use  ACh  as  the  neurotrans-
mitter.  Therefore,  BTX  is  effective  in
temporarily  reducing  or  abolishing
sweat production. Botox is the only BTX
that is approved by the FDA for axillary
hyperhidrosis.

required  by  men  in  comparison  to
women.59 One study compared the mus-
cle mass differences among 468 men and
women aged 18 to 88 years and demon-
strated  a  significantly  higher  amount  of
skeletal  muscle  in  men  than  women  in
the  muscles  of  the  face,  potentially
because  of  the  hypertrophic  effect  of
testosterone.60 Moreover,  Monks  et  al.
found  androgen  receptors  to  be  abun-
dant in the vicinity of the neuromuscular
junction.61 They  speculated  that  andro-
gens  may  even  increase  the  number  of
junctions.  The  primary  author’s  recom-
mendation  is  to  use  a  total  of  20  U  of
BTX  for  glabellar  injection  in  men  as  a
starting dose. Five injection sites of 4 U
each is the preferred method to preserve
a  more  natural  look.  Significant  care
must  be  taken  when  injecting  brows  in
men  so  as  to  avoid  cosmetically  unde-
sired effects such as feminization of the
brow  or  arching.  With  temporalis  and
masseter  injections,  men  likely  need  an
additional 25% to 100% as compared to
women.  Furthermore,  men  need  higher
doses  for  orbicularis  oculi  paralysis
owing to its broader circumference.

ETHNIC DIFFERENCES 
IN BOTULINUM 
TOXIN RESPONSES

Very 
little  information  is  available
regarding the possible ethnic differences
in the clinical effects of BTX or for dos-
ing  considerations.  To  date  there  is  a

recently  by  Levy  was  named  the
“Nefertiti Lift” (after the perfect jawline
of  the  ancient  queen).57 This  tech-
nique releases the downward tension of
the  depressor  effect  of  the  aging
platysma  and  releases  the  skin  to  the
elevator  muscles  for  lifting  action.  The
“mini-lift”  technique  requires  an  injec-
tion  of  2  to  3  U  of  BTX-A  along  and
under  each  mandible  and  to  the  upper
part of the posterior platysmal band for
a total of 15 to 20 U per side.57

CHEST The  upper  area  of  the  chest  is  a
site  of  predilection  for  photodamage.
Textural,  pigmented,  and  photodamage
changes  are  frequently  seen  in  the  V-
shaped  area  of  the  chest.  Static  and
dynamic  wrinkles  are  caused  by  both
photodamage  and  muscular  sagging  of
the  upper  chest.  Anatomically,  the
platysma  is  known  to  originate  at  the
second rib; however, it can still present
as far down as the fourth rib after which
it  traverses  the  pectoralis  major  and
inserts in the mandible.58 To date there
is  no  consensus  or  indication  for  upper
chest  injection  of  BTX-A;  however,
there are various ways to inject BTX in
the  upper  chest.  The  techniques  used
are the  curved, the “V,” and the triangu-
lar  approaches,  during  which  BTX  is
injected over a curved, V-shaped area, or
a  triangular  area  with  “5  to  10”  sites
identified  within,  each  targeted  with  2
to 8 U of BTX.48

BOTOX AND GENDER

Interest  among  men  seeking  cosmetic
procedures is increasing every day. Men
had  nearly  1.1  million  cosmetic  proce-
dures performed in 2007, accounting for
9% of the total cosmetic procedures car-
ried out in the United States. The num-
ber  of  cosmetic  procedures  for  men
increased  17%  from  2006.8 The  BTX
injection  technique  in  men  and  women
is  similar;  however,  it  is  important  to
appreciate  that  higher  doses  are  often

Botox or 2500 U Myobloc per axilla. The
effects  last  approximately  4  months
although  there  are  reports  in  the  litera-
ture  of  longer-lasting  results.66 Lowe 
et al. studied 322 patients with axillary
hyperhidrosis  in  a  multicenter,  double-
blind  trial  for  52  weeks.67 Subjects
received 50 or 75 U of Botox and were
compared to a control group of placebo

injection.  Seventy-five  percent  of  the
patients  who  received  Botox  noticed  a
reduction  of  hyperhidrosis,  while  only
25% of the placebo group noticed a dif-
ference.  The  median  duration  of  effect
was also significantly higher in patients
who received Botox when compared to
the placebo group. There was no statis-
tically significant difference between the
two  groups  receiving  toxin.  Following
the first treatment, the median duration
of  effect  was  205  days  for  the  patients
receiving 50 U and 197 days in patients
injected with 75 U of Botox.

Baumann  et  al.  studied  Myobloc  in
the  treatment  of  20  patients  with  axil-
lary  hyperhidrosis  in  a  double-blind,
randomized,  placebo-controlled  trial.
Subjects received either Myobloc (2500
U, or 0.5 mL, per axilla) or 0.5 mL vehicle
(100  mmol  NaCl,  10  mmol  succinate,
and 0.5 mg/mL human albumin) into the
bilateral axillae. The onset and duration
of action were determined to be 5 to 7
days and 2.2 to 8.1 months (mean of 5
months), respectively.68 In another study
conducted by Baumann et al., Myobloc
was  used  to  treat  20  patients  with  pal-
mar  hyperhidrosis.  Participants  were
injected  with  either  Myobloc  (5000  U
per palm) or a 1.0 mL vehicle (100 mM
NaCl, 10 mM succinate, and 0.5 mg/mL
human  albumin)  into  bilateral  palms.
The  duration  of  action  of  Myobloc  in
these  patients  ranged  from  2.3  to  4.9
months, with a mean of 3.8 months.34

Botox  for  hyperhidrosis  is  diluted
with  5.0  cc  of  preservative-free  saline,
yielding 2 U per 0.1 cc. Reloxin/Dysport
can also be diluted with 5.0 cc of preser-
vative-free saline, providing 10 U per 0.1
cc. To use Myobloc, dilute a 5000-U vial
with 2.1 cc of saline. This yields 200 U
per  0.1  cc.  Using  a  1-cc  tuberculin
syringe with a 30-gauge needle, subcuta-
neously  inject  0.05  cc  with  an  approxi-
mate depth of 3 mm with care to avoid
intramuscular  injections.  The  palm  or
sole,  including  the  webs  of  the  hands
and feet, should be injected every square
centimeter. When treating the axilla, ask
patients  which  areas  bother  them  to
determine  how  far  beyond  the  hair-
bearing  area  to  inject.  A  starch-iodine
test  may  be  performed  prior  to  injec-
tions to ascertain which areas need to be
injected.  The  iodine  solution  is  applied
to  the  affected  area  and  then  covered
with  starch.  The  areas  that  produce
sweat  will  turn  black,  indicating  which
areas to inject (Fig. 22-31A–E). Although
this test is messy, it is a useful technique
for  evaluating  the  efficacy  of  the  injec-
tions and for determining which areas to
inject.  The  primary  author  injects  the
tips  of  the  fingers  and  toes  as  well  to
avoid  compensatory  sweating  in  these
areas (Figs. 22-32 and 22-33). It is usually
necessary to inject 100 U Botox or 5000

the 

lation  of 
lingual  nerves.  The
decreased salivation was temporary, and
did not appear to be directly toxic to the
acinar cells of the gland.74 Canine studies
have also shown that vasomotor rhinor-
rhea,  a  parasympathetically  controlled
phenomenon, responds favorably to top-
ical BTX-A. While the duration of action
of BTX-A at the neuromuscular junction
appears to be approximately 3 months, a
longer-lasting  effect  may  occur  at  the
glandular  level.  BTX-A  has  produced
anhydrosis  for  more  than  12  months  in
patients  with  gustatory  sweating.  The
reason  for  the  difference  in  duration  of
action is uncertain; hypotheses include a
higher  rate  of  resynthesis  of  SNAP-25
(the  protein  cleaved  by  BTX)  in  neuro-
muscular synapses, and a higher area of
axonal  sprouting  and  consecutive  rein-
nervation  of  muscle  fibers  as  compared
to that in glandular tissue.75,76

PAIN CONTROL

With  the  expanding  use  of  botulinum
toxins in cosmetic practice, pain allevia-
tion remains an important aspect of the
injection. Pain sensation is dependent on
many factors, most importantly the con-
centration  of  the  neuropeptides  (sub-
stance P) at the site of injection, the tis-
sue  density 
(higher  tissue  density
implies  more  pain),  and  the  density  of
the nociceptor distribution at the site of
injection. Other factors include the vol-
ume  injected,  the  bore  of  the  needle
used, the layer of skin within which the
toxin  is  injected,  the  rate  of  the  fluid
injection, and, of course, the physician’s
level of experience.77

rences  of  the  hyperhidrosis.72 Gustatory
sweating is another area of neuroglandu-
lar  dysfunction  in  which  BTX-A  has
proven effective. Gustatory sweating (or
Frey’s  syndrome)  is  a  disabling  disorder
in which the cheek skin sweats profusely
during eating. The syndrome may occur
after parotidectomy, and is likely due to
the  misdirection  of 
regenerating
parasympathetic fibers that innervate the
sweat glands of the face. Intracutaneous
BTX-A has been reported to significantly
decrease  or  prevent  sweating  for  more
than 6 months, with no clinical evidence
of facial weakness in any patients.73 BTX-
A injected into the submandibular glands
has  been  reported  to  significantly
decrease salivation resulting from stimu-

the inguinal region. Appearing in adoles-
cence,  usually  not  later  than  the  age  of
25,  the  condition  continues  into  adult-
hood.  IH  is  characterized  by  chronic,
intense sweating in the inguinal region, a
situation that is potentially embarrassing
for the patient. IH symmetrically affects
the groin region, including the suprapu-
bic area, the shallow depression that lies
immediately below the fold of the groin
(corresponding  to  the  femoral  triangle),
the  medial  surfaces  of  the  upper  inner
thighs, and the genital area. It may also
include  the  lower  part  of  the  gluteus
maximus,  gluteal  fold,  and  natal  cleft.69
No study to date has described the ideal
doses  of  BTX  for  the  treatment  of  IH.
The  threshold  doses  of  BTX-A  for  the
treatment  of  hyperhidrosis  depend
on the  severity  of  the  condition.70 Two
or three units of BTX-A per square cen-
timeter  can  be  used  to  treat  the  hyper-
hidrotic area in the inguinal region. The
only  side  effects  reported  in  the  sparse
literature  are  those  related  to  the  injec-
tions, such as rare small hematomas and
temporary edema.71

OTHER NEUROGLANDULAR 
DISORDERS

The effects of BTX-A at the neuroglandu-
lar  junction  have  not  been  explored  as
extensively as those occurring at the neu-
romuscular  junction.  Clinical  studies
examining  the  effect  of  intracutaneous
BTX for focal hyperhidrosis found com-
plete abolition of sweating in the injected
area  within  3  to  7  days.  No  adverse
effects were reported, and in a 5-month
follow-up  there  were  no  clinical  recur-

 
 
 
troversial.  While  a  few  investigations
failed to show a positive effect of Botox
in the prevention of migraine or chronic
headaches,81–83 BTX  may  have  a  role  in
reducing the severity of headaches expe-
rienced by some patients.83 Some recent
studies  specifically  designed  to  target
headaches  and 
chronic  migraines
demonstrated efficacy of botulinum tox-
ins  in  patients  with  chronic  migraines
and  suggested  further  trials  to  reach  an
ideal  optimal  consensus  on  the  safety
and  efficacy  of  this  toxin  in  migraine/
headache therapy.84

BOTULINUM TOXIN IN  
PERSISTENT FACIAL FLUSHING

Facial  flushing  is  not  an  uncommon
problem  in  fair-skinned  individuals  of
Celtic  and  northern  European  descent.
A  vasomotor  phenomenon  that  results
in  increased  erythema,  persistent  facial
flushing  can  be  accompanied  by  facial
telangiectasias  and  gustatory  sweating.
Facial  flushing  is  categorized  as  either
autonomic  neural-mediated  (wet)  or
direct  vasodilator-mediated  (dry).  The
method  by  which  BTX-A  works  to
affect vasodilation is unknown, and the
results  regarding  its  efficacy  for  this
indication are inconclusive. One theory
is that BTX might work through reduc-
tion  of  local  subclinical  inflammation,
which  contributes  to  persistent  ery-
thema.  Moreover,  the  anti-inflamma-
tory  role  of  BTX-A  in  blocking  sub-
stance  P,  vanilloid  receptor  1  (TRPV-1),
and  calcitonin  gene-related  peptide
(CGRP)  is  important  in  decreasing  the
subclinical  inflammation  that  might
present as erythema.85 Only Yuraitis et
al.  have  described  an  improvement
related to facial flushing in limited case
reports.86 Alexandroff  as  well  as
Kranendonk  et  al.  failed  to  show  an
effective  response  to  BTX-A  for  facial
flushing  in  three  published  cases.87,88
Further  studies  are  required  to  better
assess  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  this
procedure.

hour prior to treating for hyperhidrosis,
the  topical  anesthetic  Ela-Max™  or
EMLA  (eutectic  mixture  of  local  anes-
thetic)  is  applied  to  the  area  to  be
treated.  Next,  these  areas  are  occluded
with  plastic  bags  or  gloves  when  treat-
ing  hands  and  feet  or  with  tape  when
treating  axillae.  Many  attempts  have
been made to decrease the pain associ-
ated  with  the  use  of  BTX  for  palmar
hyperhidrosis. These have included top-
ical  anesthetics,  intravenous  regional
anesthesia,  nerve  blocks,  ice,  Frigiderm
spray,79 and  others.  The  use  of  nitrous
oxide  (“laughing  gas”)  requires  office
training  and  can  induce  an  anxiolytic
rather  than  a  pain-diminishing  effect.79
Ongoing  trials  to  assess  the  effects  of
different  anesthetics  for  an  optimal
injection with minimal pain are needed
to establish the full potential of the dif-
ferent  approaches  of  pain  reduction
with BTX injections.

of  three  available  preparations  of  the
toxin showed that the pain induced by
Neurobloc (BTX-B) was found to be sig-
nificantly  higher  than  that  induced  by
Botox  and  Dysport  (BTX-A),  between
which  no  significant  difference  was
found. The study concluded that the dif-
ferent chemical properties and pharma-
ceutical  adjuvants  in  toxins  A  and  B
likely affect the pain sensation and spec-
ulated  that  the  pH  difference  of
Neurobloc  (pH  5.6)  and  Botox/Dysport
(pH 6.8) influences pain perception.

Pain sensation during toxin injections
is usually fleeting, and simple measures
can improve patient comfort.78 For facial
wrinkles,  anesthesia  is  not  necessary
unless  the  patient  prefers  it.  The  30-
gauge needles that are used to inject the
medication are the same size as acupunc-
ture needles and cause minimal pain in a
calm patient. Allowing the BTX to come
to  room  temperature  may  decrease  the
level  of  pain  otherwise  felt  by  the
patient. When the physician approaches
the patient in a calm and reassuring man-
ner, not allowing the patient see the nee-
dles  prior  to  and  during  the  injections,
the  patient’s  anxiety  is  significantly
reduced as is the perception of pain.

Topical  anesthetic  creams  such  as
EMLATM or LMXTM can be applied prior
to injection to decrease the sensation of
pain.  BTX  should  not  be  mixed  with
local  anesthetics  because  they  can  alter
the pH of the preparation and cause the
toxin  to  lose  potency.  Ice  packs  can  be
applied  prior  to  injections,  which  may
decrease  the  pain  and  encourage  vaso-
constriction,  resulting  in  less  bruising
(see Chapter 21).

For  hyperhidrosis,  pain  control  is  a
necessity,  especially  for  the  palms  and
soles.  Although  some  physicians  per-
form  nerve  blocks,  the  primary  author
uses  the  following  method:  at  least  1

in a lowered sebum potential across the
ducts  and  skin.90 Moreover,  decreased
sebocyte  promoter  differentiation  and
levels  may  clinically
lower  sebum 
improve  acne  by  decreasing 
the
growth of P. acnes. Thus, the ability to
decrease  sebum  production  decreases
P. acnes growth  and  acne  development.
Additionally,  BTX  inhibits  sweat  pro-
duction by sweat glands. Decreased per-
spiration may clinically improve acne by
reducing  the  growth  of  P.  acnes.91
Furthermore, follicular occlusion by ker-
atinocytes is the final common pathway
in each of the various routes leading to
acne.  Keratinocyte  migration  is  inhib-
ited  by  the  high-dose  stimulation  of
nicotinic  ACh  receptors.  By  inhibiting
the release of ACh, BTX may indirectly
increase the migration of keratinocytes,
thus reducing follicular occlusion.92 The
androgen  surge  during  puberty  is  a
known  instigator  of  acne,  and  studies
have shown that androgens increase the
number of ACh receptors. Interestingly,
androgen receptors are found on pilose-
baceous  duct  keratinocytes,  which  are
important  in  follicular  occlusion.  It  is
postulated  that  during  puberty  andro-
gens increase the number of ACh recep-
tors on the pilosebaceous keratinocytes,
leading  to  further  inhibition  of  ker-
atinocyte locomotion through increased
ACh  stimulation.  By  inhibiting  the
release of ACh, BTX decreases the num-
ber  of  ACh  receptors  on  the  piloseba-
ceous  keratinocytes,  thereby  increasing
keratinocyte 
through
locomotion 
decreased ACh stimulation.93

Finally, surprising results from recent
research  have  shown  that  holocrine

anti-inflammatory 

BTX  may  inhibit  the  cascade  of
events  leading  to  acne.  This  is  likely
achieved 
through  parasympathetic
effects,  inhibiting  sweat  gland  activity,
and sebaceous gland secretion as well as
stimulating  keratinocyte  locomotion.
Associated 
and
antiandrogenic  effects  may  also  con-
tribute.  We  hypothesize  that  BTX-A
toxin  inhibits  the  formation  of  acne
through  at  least  three  different  path-
ways. First, BTX inhibits sebum produc-
tion  by  sebaceous  glands  through
cholinergic  inhibition  and  sebocyte  dif-
ferentiation. Cholinergic secretions nor-
mally attributed to increased sebum pro-

BOTULINUM TOXINS AND 
ACNE VULGARIS

sebum  production; 

Acne,  which  most  commonly  occurs
during  adolescence,  is  influenced  by
several  factors  (see  Chapter  15).  The
pathology centers on the pilosebaceous
(comprising  the  sebaceous
follicle 
gland),  the  follicle  (pore),  and  vellus
hair.  Factors  that  promote  the  forma-
tion  of  comedones  (whiteheads  or
blackheads)  include  the  following:  (1)
(2)
increased 
inflammation  of  the  dermis  and  folli-
cles  by  inflammatory  mediators;  (3)
hyperkeratinization and obstruction of
the upper region of the follicle; and (4)
colonization  of  the  follicle  by  the
bacterium  Propionibacterium  acnes.
Adolescence  is  marked  by  an  increase
in levels of circulating androgens, par-
ticularly  dehydroepiandrosterone  sul-
fate (DHEAS). The increased androgen
levels  are  thought  to  cause  sebaceous
glands  to  enlarge  and  increase  sebum
production.  While  most  acne  patients
have normal hormone levels, increased
sebum  production  plays  an  important
role  in  acne.  A  correlation  exists
between the rate of sebum production
and  the  severity  of  acne.  In  addition,
acne patients typically produce sebum
that is deficient in linoleic acid, which
is  a  potential  cause  of  abnormal  kera-
tinization  and  follicular  obstruction.
Increased sebum levels can also irritate
keratinocytes,  causing  the  release  of
interleukin-1,  which  in  turn  can  cause
follicular  hyperkeratinization.  The
final  common  pathway  in  each  of
these  acne-causing  routes,  which  are

treatment of obesity. Fat distribution and
its  physiology  are  partly  known  to  be
under the control of the autonomic ner-
vous  system.  Multiple  research  studies
have  revealed  that  lipoatrophy  and
degradation  of  adipocytes  was  noticed
after  denervation.95 There  is  disagree-
ment  regarding  whether  or  not  nervous
system  innervation  plays  a  role  in  fat
accumulation.  Bilbao  et  al.  showed  that
vagotomy  reduced  fat  accumulation  in
rats and postulated that vagotonia plays a
role in the development of obesity.96 On
the other hand, Jones et al. showed that
muscle action-related sympathetic activ-
ity is associated with advancing age and
increased  abdominal  adiposity.97 This
disparity  was  linked  to  a  high  sympa-
ratio.98
thetic 
to  parasympathetic 
Following  observations  of  coincidental
lipoatrophy  after  BTX  injections,  it  has
been  postulated  that  BTX  injected  in
subcutaneous  fat  might  achieve  fat  loss
for  cosmesis.99 Lim  et  al.  suggested  a
scheme by which subcutaneous fat den-
ervation  and  hence  focal  lipoatrophy
could be achieved. They recommended a 
maximum injectable total dose of 200 U
for the intended area of fat reduction with
an  even  distribution  of  each  injection.95
Further research in this area is required to
establish a better risk–benefit ratio of this
potential  Botox  use  and  to  provide  a
guided consensus for its optimal use.

BOTULINUM AND HAIR 
GROWTH CONTROL

Focal  hair  loss  following  BTX-A  treat-
ment  for  blepharoplasm  and  oro-
mandibular dystonia has been reported,
but  remains  controversial.100,101 Several
theories have been suggested to explain
this  observation,  specifically  the  fact
that  hair  follicles  contain  cholinergic
receptors,  which  are  essential  signaling
elements  for  nerve  transmission  that
send  growth  signals  to  hair  follicles.102
When inhibited by BTX, those receptors
may  lead  to  hair  loss.103 Hair  loss  has
also been described in conditions related
to peripheral nerve dysfunction such as
diabetic  peripheral  neuropathy,  myx-
oma of the nerve sheath, and after occip-
ital nerve block with corticosteroid. BTX
could  have  the  same  effect  through
chemodenervation.  These  observations
need  to  be  studied  before  arriving  at  a
conclusion or establishing a new indica-
tion for BTX. Cutrer and Pittelkow have
actually reported regrowth of hair rather
than  loss  after  Botox  was  administered
for alopecia areata, extending the debate
over whether Botox actually causes hair
regrowth or loss.104

BOTULINUM TOXIN AND 
CHEMICAL LIPOSUCTION

Obesity is a medical problem with obvi-
ous  cosmetic  implications.  Liposuction,
gastric  volume  reduction,  laparoscopic
banding, lipase inhibitors, and mesother-
apy  are  all  methods  employed  in  the

 
 
overall skin tone and texture. One study
indicated  that  CO2 ablative  laser  resur-
facing combined with BTX-A provided a
stronger  and  longer-lasting  effect.107
Within many cosmetic practices, BTX-A
is now a part of the standard resurfacing
protocol.

The synergistic effects of BTX-A and
other  rejuvenation  procedures  can
extend to intense pulsed light protocols.
In  one  study,  the  combined  effect  of
intense  pulsed  light  and  BTX-A  pro-
duced  a  more  pronounced  global  aes-
thetic  improvement  in  reducing  crow’s
feet, telangiectasia, pore size, and lentig-
ines,  as  well  as  ameliorating  facial  skin
texture  as  compared  with  the  use  of
intense pulsed light alone.108

RESISTANCE TO 
BOTULINUM TOXIN
Development of Antibodies

neurotoxins  may 

Botulinum 
be
immunogenic, and antibodies may inac-
tivate the molecule. The BTX molecule
is composed of a light chain and a heavy
chain. The toxin is embedded in a pro-
tein  complex  that  protects  the  toxin’s
binding  site  until  the  desired  pH  is
reached  and  the  toxin  is  released.
Antibodies to this critical binding site on
the  heavy  chain  of  the  BTX  molecule
will  prevent  binding  of  the  toxin  to  its
receptor, thereby crippling the actions of
the  toxin.  “Neutralizing  antibodies”
have  been  reported  in  patients  treated
with  high  doses  of  BTX  for  neurologic
disorders  such  as  cerebral  palsy.  It  is
important  to  understand  that  there  are
many types of antibodies that can inter-
act  with  BTX;  however,  the  only  anti-
bodies that can affect the efficacy of the
toxin  are  neutralizing  antibodies.
Antibodies may develop to BTX that are
inconsequential  to  the  patient,  yet  the
antibodies that are capable of neutraliz-
ing the toxin are a concern as they have
the potential to decrease the efficacy of
the toxin. By definition, antibodies that
neutralize  BTX-A  would  not  neutralize
BTX-B  and  vice  versa.  Patients  who
develop  antibodies  to  BTX-A  can  still
enjoy the benefits of BTX-B. For this rea-
son,  it  is  recommended  that  practition-
ers have several different BTX serotypes
available on the market.

The  incidence  of  antibody-mediated

generally to be approximately 5%. The

ment of antibodies is lack of response to

BTX-A AND  
COSMETIC SURGERY

BTX-A  can  be  used  before  or  after  the
surgical manipulation to either enhance
or sustain benefits. If injected in the pre-
operative  period,  the  toxin  may  allow
improved 
tissue  manipulation  and
reduced  incisional  tension  leading  to
improved  healing.  Prior  to  endoscopic
brow lift or a face lift using endoscopy,
BTX-A  injections  help  in  raising  the
position of the brow and can reduce the
amount of surgical manipulations neces-
sary.  Finally,  when  used  after  surgery,
BTX-A  weakens  the  musculature,  pro-
longing the anticipated effect.105

COMBINED THERAPIES: BTX-A 
AND OTHER REJUVENATION 
MODALITIES

The  superiority  of  BTX-A  when  used
with  other  cosmetic  procedures  has
been documented in a number of stud-
ies. When administered 1 week prior to
the treatment with filling agents, BTX-A
prevents the distortion of the fillers and
prolongs the effects of augmentation by
reducing  the  muscular  activity  associ-
ated with rhytide formation.106

BTX-A therapy works synergistically
with  resurfacing  techniques  to  provide
an  optimal  improvement  of  dynamic
rhytides  and  in  some  cases  enhance

should lead to a lower incidence of anti-
body  formation.  As  previously  dis-
cussed, Merz Pharmaceuticals, the man-
ufacturer  of  the  new  BTX  product
Xeomin, claims that its product contains
a negligible amount of bacterial proteins
(0.6 ng) with lower immune response. In
spite of the concerns regarding immuno-
genicity,  there  are  no  known  or  pub-
lished reports of antibody production in
patients treated with doses of any of the
available  BTX  products  for  cosmetic
indications, which may be explained by
the  lower  doses  used  in  comparison
with  neurologic  and  cervical  dystonia
indications  where  reports  of  resistance
are centered.111

avoidance.

Many  researchers  have  postulated
that  the  risk  of  antibody  formation  is
due in part to the quantity of protein or
the “protein load” of the toxin, the type
of  protein  present  in  the  toxin,  and  to
other  factors  listed  in  Table  22-6.
Manufacturers  of  BTX  have  attempted
to  minimize  each  of  these  factors  in
order  to  create  a  less  immunogenic
product. For example, the original Botox
that was used until December 1997 con-
tained a higher level of protein than the
Botox  currently  in  use;  therefore,  it

further  injections.  The  use  of  other
serotypes  (F  or  B)  may  benefit  those
who  have  developed  antibody  resis-
tance.  There  are  two  types  of  therapy
resistance  to  BTX,  primary  and  sec-
ondary. A patient who does not respond
to the first injection of BTX-A is referred
to as a “primary nonresponder,” but rea-
sons  for  nonresponse  can  include  inap-
propriate  site  of  injection,  poor  tech-
nique, and/or insufficient dose.109,110

Immunogenicity should be suspected
in a patient who no longer responds to
BTX-A (“secondary nonresponder”) fol-
lowing  a  successful  course  of  earlier
injections. Antibody formation could be
targeted against the neurotoxin compo-
nent of BTX or against its nontoxic pro-
tein  component.  The  recommended
approach is to inject 20 U BTX into the
hypothenar  or  forehead  muscles.  If  the
patient responds to BTX, then transient
weakness  will  develop  in  the  muscle  1
to 2 weeks after injection. An alternative
is  to  take  blood  for  an  antibody  assay
that is rarely used. In secondary nonre-
sponders,  the  problem  can  be  further
overcome  by  using  a  different  BTX
serotype,  for  example,  BTX-B  if  resis-
tance develops to BTX-A. 

Risk  factors  for  the  development  of
antibodies  include  higher  doses,  shorter
intervals  between  injections,  booster
doses, and young age. Recommendations
to help prevent development of antibod-
ies  include  the  following:  (1)  use  of  the
smallest  possible  dose  to  achieve  relief,
(2)  an  interval  between  injections  of  at
least  1  month  (the  preferred  interval  is

injection site(s) is one of the most com-
mon  adverse  events  and  the  incidence
can  be  lessened  by  avoiding  aspirin,
NSAIDs, green tea, vitamin E, and other
anticoagulants for 10 days prior to treat-
ment.  Anecdotal  reports  reveal  that
application of ice packs to the area prior
to injection reduces the pain of the pro-
cedure  and  the  incidence  of  bruising.
Some studies have shown an association
with  flu-like  symptoms  (Botox  and
Myobloc)  and  dry  mouth  (Myobloc)
after injection of these products in larger
doses used for neurologic indications.

The most serious side effects of BTX
treatment  in  the  upper  face  are  ptosis
and, very rarely, diplopia or ectropion.112
Proper placement of the toxin with good
injection  technique  will  drastically
reduce the incidence of these temporary
side effects. In fact, many experts anec-
dotally state that physicians just learning
to perform BTX injections in the upper
face have approximately a 4% incidence
of inducing ptosis, which, with practice,
falls to 0.5%.

Adverse effects from injection into the
platysma can include bruising, drooling,
downturning of the corner of the mouth,
weakness in the neck muscles, and dys-
phagia. Lip ptosis or mouth asymmetry
may result from injections in this area.

Treatment of the palms and soles for
hyperhidrosis  can  induce  temporary
muscle  weakness.  One  should  exercise
caution  when  treating  patients  that
require a strong grip (e.g., tennis players)
and  manual  dexterity  (e.g.,  piano  play-
ers) and these patients should be aware
of  the  risks  of  treatment  of  the  palms.
One  other  cautionary  note:  the  use  of
Botox has been reported, in one patient,
to have unmasked underlying myasthe-
nia  gravis;113 therefore,  its  use  is  con-
traindicated in patients with myasthenia
gravis, systemic lupus, and other autoim-
mune disorders associated with a preex-
isting neuromuscular condition. Dysport
is  the  only  brand  of  BTX  that  contains
lactose.  Its  use  has  been  blamed  for  a
fixed  drug  eruption  in  one  patient.114
Care should be taken to label all syringes
containing  BTX  to  avoid  inadvertent
administration of the toxin.

SUMMARY

The injection of the C. botulinum A exo-
toxin  is  a  safe;  fast,  and  nontraumatic
approach to correcting wrinkles, raising
eyebrows,  and  improving  hyperhidro-

Dermal Fillers

Leslie Baumann, MD

The  dermal  filler  market  is  rapidly
growing  worldwide.  According  to  the
American Academy of Aesthetic Plastic
Surgeons,  1,448,716  people  received
hyaluronic acid (HA) injections by plas-
tic  surgeons  in  2007  (Table  23-1).  The
actual  number  is  likely  much  higher
when factoring in procedures performed
by  dermatologists  and  other  aestheti-
cally  oriented  physicians  and  physician
extenders.  Although  collagen  products
(Zyplast and Zyderm) were the first der-
mal  fillers  to  become  widely  available,
collagen 
largely  been
replaced by HA fillers.

fillers  have 

The  ultimate  goal  of  dermal  fillers  is
to smooth out wrinkles and folds, even
out scars, volumize furrows and sunken
valleys,  contour  unevenness  and  laxity,
and  sculpt  skin  into  a  360-degree,  reju-
venated look. Over the last quarter cen-
tury,  several  kinds  of  products  suitable
for  soft  tissue  augmentation  have
become available, with intense industry
research  yielding  more  and  more  filler
options  with 
increasing  regularity.
Different  regulatory  mechanisms  usu-
ally leave the US a few months or years
behind  other  developed  countries  in
making  the  latest  products  available  to
patients.

HISTORY

the 

In  1893,  by  transplanting  fat  from  the
arms  into  facial  defects,  Neuber  became
the  first  physician  to  practice  soft  tissue
augmentation.1 In the middle of the 20th
century,  soft  tissue  augmentation  could
best  be  characterized  by  the  use  of  sili-
cone. Although popular in the 1940s and
1950s,  silicone  use  was  associated  with
the development of foreign body granulo-
mas, which ultimately prompted the ban-
ning of silicone in 1992 until a new form
of the substance (intended for ophthalmo-
logic  use)  was  approved  by  the  United
States  Food  and  Drug  Administration
(FDA) in the late 1990s. In the meantime,
though, the field of soft tissue augmenta-
tion had come into its own, in the 1970s,
introduction  by  Stanford
with 
University  researchers  of  animal-derived
collagen  implants.2 By  the  1980s,  the 
use  of  collagen  injections  for  wrinkles 
had  entered  the  mainstream.  While
Americans were enjoying the benefits of
bovine  collagen  fillers  (i.e.,  Zyderm  and
Zyplast), other countries began to experi-
ment  with  dermal  HA  fillers  such  as
Hylaform and later Restylane in the mid
to  late  1990s.  The  beginning  of  the  21st
century  ushered  in  the  introduction  of
newer  nonbovine 
fillers,
CosmoDerm  and  CosmoPlast,  and  HA
fillers, such as Captique and Juvéderm, as
well  as  other  synthetic  fillers,  Sculptra,
Radiesse,  and  Artefill  into  the  United
States market. With different forms of soft
tissue  augmentation  agents  currently
available in the United States and others in
the  pipeline,  selecting  the  appropriate
filler  is  challenging  for  physicians  and
patients alike. In order to achieve optimal
cosmetically-pleasing results, it is incum-
bent  upon  dermatologists  to  obtain
thorough  comprehension  of  the  charac-
teristics  of  available  fillers,  their  indica-
tions,  contraindications,  benefits  and
drawbacks, and ways to resolve potential
complications.  In  this  chapter,  we  will
review  the  basics  behind  the  art  and
science of the broad array of dermal fillers
on the market in the United States. This
will be preceded by a brief discussion of
regulatory  issues  and  the  patient  evalua-
tion and consultation.

collagen 

REGULATION

In the US, dermal fillers are regulated as
medical devices. In order to obtain FDA
approval,  the  company  applying  for

approval for a dermal filler must satisfy
the  intense  safety  and  efficacy  criteria
including  nonteratogenicity,  nonmigra-
tion,  noncarcinogenesis,  biocompatibil-
ity, and optimal purity, as well as repro-
ducible and durable efficacy in correcting
skin defects. Unfortunately, some physi-
cians and physician extenders choose to
use  dermal  filling  substances  that  have
not  yet  received  FDA  approval  for  any
indication. This is not advisable for sev-
eral  reasons  including  the  fact  that  it  is
illegal and that the safety of these prod-
ucts has not been established. With the
multitude  of  safe,  efficacious,  and
durable fillers on the market, there is no
need  or  justifiable  reason  to  use  unap-
proved dermal fillers in the US.

PATIENT EVALUATION 
AND CONSULTATION

When embarking on soft tissue augmen-
tation, proper preparations are essential.
An  initial  consultation  should  include
distant  and  close  evaluation  of  the
patient’s  facial  structure  and  discussion
of  the  cosmetic  treatment  options.  The
patient’s  history  is  taken  to  assess  con-
traindications  including  allergy  to  filler
components, herpes facialis, pregnancy/
lactation,  keloid  predisposition,  and
autoimmune diseases. In addition, use of
medications that inhibit clotting such as
aspirin  and  ibuprofen  should  be  exam-
ined.  The  ideal  cosmetic  outcome  is
achieved through a combination of vari-
ous  cosmetic  procedures  in  order  to
attain an even tone, smooth texture, and
adequate  facial  volume  and  shape.  The
discussion  of  the  sequence  and  descrip-
tion of each proposed procedure, alterna-
tives,  risks  and  benefits,  financial  cost,
and recovery period prepares the patient
for  realistic  expectations  and  informed
decision-making.  After  the  treatment
procedures  are  selected  and  informed
consent  is  signed  and  witnessed,  the
patient  should  undergo  pretreatment
photography  for  the  purpose  of  docu-
mentation;  posttreatment  photography
is  scheduled  immediately  after  and  on
the follow-up visits. For novice patients,
it  is  better  to  start  the  soft  tissue  inter-
vention  with  the  temporary  and  pre-
dictable  fillers  (e.g.,  collagen  and  HA),
and  then  gradually  advance  with  more
lasting fillers (e.g., Sculptra and Radiesse)
based on their comfort level and desire.

is,  first,  to  prevent  them.  To  reduce
bruising, patients should avoid anticoag-
ulant  medications  or  supplements  (e.g.,
aspirin, vitamin E, etc.) for 10 days prior
and several days after the procedure (see
Chapter  21).  The  utility  of  Arnica  mon-
tana oral  tablets  or  topical  gel  or  post-
procedure  oral  bromelain  supplements
to decrease ecchymoses is anecdotal but
these  are  often  used  in  the  primary
author’s  practice.  The  pain  associated
with  injection  can  be  diminished  with
topical  (e.g., 
lidocaine  cream,  ice),
regional  (e.g.,  infraorbital,  dental  nerve
block),  or  intraprocedural  anesthesia
(e.g.,  fillers  that  contain  lidocaine).
Patients  prone  to  regional  herpes  out-
breaks  should  obtain  antiviral  prophy-
laxis  with  systemic  medications  (e.g.,
valcyclovir  1  g  twice  daily  for  3  days,
starting a day before the procedure). The
procedure  should  be  conducted  in  a
clean,  safe,  well-lit,  and  soothing  envi-
ronment that is prepared to address any
potential  complications.  Vasovagal
responses are not uncommon; therefore,
orange  juice  should  be  available  in  the
event  that  the  patient  feels  dizzy  or
faint. Topical steroids may be needed in
case  of  a  contact  allergy  to  lidocaine
cream.  Most  importantly,  nitropaste
should be immediately available in case
a  purple  duskiness  is  seen  on  injection,
warning of a possible arterial occlusion.
Some  physicians 
suggest  keeping
hyaluronidase on hand in case an arterial
occlusion occurs with HA.3

TYPES OF FILLERS

Dermal fillers can be classified based on
various  criteria:  depth  of  implantation
(superficial  upper  and  middermis,  deep
dermis,  and  subcutaneous 
levels);
longevity  of  correction  (temporary,
semipermanent,  and  permanent);  aller-
genicity  (whether  preprocedure  allergic
testing  is  required);  composition  of  the
agent  (xenografts,  allografts,  or  autolo-
gous, semi/fully synthetic); and stimula-
tory behavior (capacity to drive physio-
logic  processes  of  endogenous  tissue
proliferation)  versus  replacement  fillers
(space-replacing effect). Safety and effi-
cacy  studies  of  the  available  fillers  are
required  by  the  FDA;  however,  studies
looking at the durability of the filler are
not  required  and,  therefore,  subject  to
disagreement  and  frequent  citing  of
anecdotal evidence. The lasting effect of
the  filler  is  dependent  on  the  composi-
tion,  amount  used,  depth  injected,  and
carrier  of  the  agent.  Our  discussion  of
fillers  will  proceed  by  dividing  them

according  to  composition:  collagen
fillers will be discussed first, followed by
HA fillers, and then other agents.

TEMPORARY FILLERS

Injectable fillers such as collagen and HA
are  biodegradable  and  last  from  4  to 
9 months. These fillers commonly serve
an  important  role  as  the  initial  step  for
new  patients  interested  in  soft  tissue
augmentation. Because of their transient
effect,  the  potential  patient  dissatisfac-
tion and side effects are also short-lived.
Therefore,  temporary  fillers  should
always be the first line of therapy, sav-
ing  the  longer-lasting  fillers  for  future
patient visits.

Collagen

The  major  structural  component  of  the
dermis,  collagen  is  the  most  abundant
protein  in  the  human  organism  as  well
as  the  skin,  in  particular,  and  confers
strength  and  support  to  the  skin.
Collagen is also one of the strongest nat-
ural  proteins,  imparting  durability  and
resilience  to  the  skin,  and  comprising
70% of dry skin mass4 (see Chapter 2).
What is known as “collagen” is actually
a meshwork of scaffolding-like structures
composed  of  a  complex  family  of  over
18  types,  11  of  which  are  found  in  the
dermis. Type I collagen (80%–85%) and
type III collagen (10%–15%) are the pri-
mary collagen constituents in the dermal
matrix  of  adult  human  skin.  Dermal
fibroblasts produce a precursor form of
collagen,  (cid:5) procollagens,  which  in  turn
produce  both  collagen  types  I  and  III,
each of which is composed of three col-
lagen chains.

Skin  fragility  and  wrinkles  result
from the loss of collagen, which occurs
with  aging  as  well  as  solar  exposure
and  other  insults.  UV  light,  free  radi-
cals,  and  other  factors  cause  the  body
to produce collagenase, an enzyme that
breaks down collagen. The injection of
various forms of collagen into the skin
helps  it  regain  a  youthful  appearance,
but  such  results  are  temporary.  The

range  of  collagen  products  has  in-
creased  in  recent  years  as  manufactur-
ers have worked to extend the duration
of product effects.

BOVINE COLLAGEN
Overview With  a  record  of  safety  and
efficacy  spanning  over  two  decades,
bovine collagen was the traditional der-
mal filler agent used to ameliorate unde-
sirable  signs  of  cutaneous  facial  aging.5
In 1977, Zyderm I was introduced as the
first  injectable  bovine  collagen  implant;
it was approved by the FDA in 1981 for
fine  lines  and  shallow  acne  scars.
Zyderm II and Zyplast were introduced
and  approved,  respectively,  in  1983  for
moderate  lines  and  deeper  acne  scars
and  1985  for  deep  dermal  folds  and
lines. Although these products were the
standard  for  years  to  which  newer
implants  were  compared,  because  of
better  safety  profiles,  human-derived
collagen and HA products have become
more  widely  used.  Zyderm  I  is  96%
type I collagen and 4% type III collagen
derived  from  the  bovine  skin  of  US
enclosed  cattle  herds.  Zyderm  I  and  II
differ  only  by  collagen  concentration.
Zyderm  I  contains  35  mg/cc,  while
Zyderm II contains 65 mg/cc. The differ-
ence in concentration is significant inso-
far  as  it  renders  Zyderm  II  thicker  and
stiffer  than  Zyderm  I.  Like  Zyderm  I,
Zyplast  contains  35  mg/cc  of  collagen,
but  this  collagen  is  cross-linked  with
glutaraldehyde,  which  makes  it  last
longer  via  resistance  to  degradation
(Table  23-2).  Consequently,  Zyplast  is
more  viscous  and  less  immunogenic
than Zyderm.6

Zyderm  and  Zyplast  are  white  sub-
stances prepackaged in 0.5-, 1-, and 2-mL
syringes  and  injected  with  a  30-gauge
0.5-inch needle. The product should be
stored in the refrigerator ideally at 4(cid:2)C.
While Zyderm I is properly injected into
superficial  dermis  at  20-  to  30-degree
angles  with  the  expectation  of  tempo-
rary  skin  blanching,  Zyderm  II  can 
be  injected  slightly  deeper  at  35-  to 
45-degree  angles  with  less  anticipated
blanching  and  minimal  overcorrection.

Since Zyderm is diluted with phosphate-
buffered  sterile  saline,  which  is  rapidly
reabsorbed in skin, to achieve the opti-
mal  effect,  overcorrecting  implantation
is  necessary.  Zyplast  is  implanted  into
even deeper dermis at 45- to 90-degree
angles  with  minimal  delayed  blanching
and without overcorrection.

Beneﬁts Bovine-derived collagen dermal
filling agents effectively reduce wrinkles
and  scars.  Zyplast  is  appropriate  for
shaping the vermilion border of the lips
and  treating  moderate  and  deep  wrin-
kles,  such  as  nasolabial  folds  and
atrophic  scars.  Zyderm  I  is  well  suited
for  treating  superficial  rhytides  (e.g.,
horizontal  forehead  wrinkles,  crow’s
feet, fine perioral wrinkles, and scars) or
for use over Zyplast in deeper wrinkles.
The higher concentration of collagen in
Zyderm  II  renders  this  product  more
appropriate  for  acne  scar  revision  (see
Chapter  26),  but  Zyplast  lasts  longer
because  it  is  cross-linked.  Collagenase
ultimately  succeeds  in  degrading  these
products,  returning  the  skin  to  its
appearance prior to injection. Zyplast is
the  most  commonly  used  bovine  colla-
gen  product  and  lasts  approximately 
4  months,  just  slightly  longer  than
Zyderm I and II. Bovine collagen can be
safely reinjected 3 to 4 times per year if
needed.  Zyderm  and  Zyplast  are  the
least  expensive  dermal  fillers  on  the
market  and  typically  engender  less
bruising than products that contain HA.
All the bovine collagen products contain
0.3% lidocaine to reduce the pain asso-
ciated with the procedure.

Drawbacks Two skin tests, 6 and 2 weeks
before  the  scheduled  treatment,  are
required  before  the  use  of  bovine  colla-
gen agents to reduce the risk of inducing
hypersensitive or allergic reactions. Such
responses  can  occur  as  early  as  6  hours
after  the  test,  but  are  more  likely  to
emerge 48 hours or 4 weeks after the test.
A positive skin test disqualifies a patient
for treatment with bovine collagen.

Approximately 3% of the general pop-
ulation  is  thought  to  be  sensitive  to
bovine  collagen.7 Although  a  patient  is
unlikely  to  react  to  bovine  collagen
implants after two negative skin tests, the
risk is never completely eliminated. The
risk of hypersensitive reaction is 1.3% to
6.2% after one negative test8,9 and 0.5%
after  two  negative  tests  (Fig.  23-1).
Patients  should  be  advised  that  should
such a reaction occur, it can be expected
to  spontaneously  resolve  within  4  to 
24  months.8,9 Allergic  reactions  also
arise,  albeit  rarely,  following  multiple

brief  course  of  systemic  corticosteroids
can be effective to treat these reactions.
Oral cyclosporine10 (Figs. 23-2 and 23-3)
and topical tacrolimus11 have also report-
edly  been  used  for  the  successful  treat-
ment of recalcitrant hypersensitive reac-
tions  to  bovine  collagen.  Patients  with
lidocaine hypersensitivity are contraindi-
cated  for  obtaining  these  injections

quently  occur  (e.g.,  abscesses,  bacterial

formation, ecchymoses, and local necro-
sis).  Several  previously  discussed  pre-
ventative  steps  can  be  taken  to  reduce
the 
likelihood  of  such  outcomes.
Because  of  its  viscosity,  Zyplast  should
not be injected into the glabellar region,

bioengineered collagen implants include
CosmoDerm  I,  CosmoDerm  II,  and
CosmoPlast 
(Allergan  Corporation,
Irvine,  CA),  which  contain  human
collagen  types  I  and  III,  and  were
approved  by  the  FDA  in  March  2003.
CosmoDerm I is composed of 35 mg/cc
human-bioengineered  collagen  distrib-
uted  in  a  phosphate-based  saline  solu-
tion and 0.3% lidocaine. CosmoDerm II
contains  twice  the  collagen  concentra-
tion  of  CosmoDerm  I.  CosmoPlast
contains the same ingredients as Cosmo-
Derm I, but is cross-linked by glutaralde-
hyde,  yielding  a  product  more  resistant
to  degradation,  thus  lasting  longer,  and
more  appropriate  for  use  in  treating
deeper  furrows.  While  CosmoDerm  is
indicated  for  superficial  wrinkles  and
shallow  scars,  CosmoPlast,  which
exhibits a stiff consistency (even more so
than  products  containing  HA),  is  well
suited to treating the vermilion border of
the lips (Fig. 23-4), as well as raising the
corners of the mouth. In addition, it is a
good choice to correct deformities of the
bridge of the nose or to raise the nasal tip
(Fig. 23-5). CosmoPlast is typically used
in  combination,  usually  with  an  HA
agent,  to  treat  medium  and  deep  wrin-
kles,  with  the  collagen  product  injected
first  to  create  a  volume-filling  base  and
the HA filler injected more superficially
into the same location.

Similar  to  bovine  collagens,  Cosmo-
Derm  and  CosmoPlast  are  white  sub-
stances  prepackaged  in  1-mL  syringes
and  injected  via  30-gauge  0.5-inch  nee-
dles.  Although  some  anecdotal  reports
indicate better rheology of human colla-
gen  fillers,  their  technique  of  injection,
cosmetic  outcome,  and  durability  are

of  bovine-derived  collagen,  have  devel-

Unlike  earlier  cadaver-derived  collagen
(i.e., Cymetra) and, more recently, autol-
ogous  collagen  (i.e.,  Isolagen),  bioengi-
neered  human  collagen  is  pregenerated
to ensure ease of accessibility. The man-
ufacturing process begins with the har-
vesting  of  dermal  fibroblasts  from  bio-
engineered  human  skin  and  placement
into  a  three-dimensional  mesh.  The
fibroblasts are then cultured in a bioreac-
tor  that  simulates  the  conditions  of  the
human  body.  Then,  the  fibroblasts
synthesize  collagen  and  extracellular
matrix proteins. The derived collagen is
purified  to  enhance  safety.  Human-

immediate  blanching  and  pain.  Warm
compresses,  topical  nitroglycerin,  and
meticulous  wound  care  are  necessary
treatments.  Prior  to  1990,  beads  and
cysts were reported at the injection site
in  0.04%  of  patients  treated  with
Zyderm  or  Zyplast,  most  likely  caused
by injections that were too superficial.12
Injections should be made only into the
to  avoid  such  reactions.13
dermis 
Abscesses  should  be  treated  with  inci-
sion and drainage and a combination of
antibiotics and corticosteroids to reduce
secondary scarring. More than a decade
ago,  there  was  some  speculation  that
autoimmune  diseases,  namely,  poly-
myositis and dermatomyositis, might be
induced by the injection of bovine colla-
gen,14 but  studies  have  demonstrated
that  antibodies  to  bovine  collagen  do
not cross-react with human collagen.15,16
Therefore, the FDA has agreed that it is
unlikely  that  bovine  collagen  causes
connective tissue disease in humans.9,17
Further,  a  study  by  Hanke  et  al. 
showed  that  the 
incident  rate  of
polymyositis/dermatomyositis in patients
receiving bovine collagen was not higher
than  the  control-matched  population.18
However,  the  authors  recommend
avoiding  the  use  of  bovine  collagen-
containing fillers in patients with a his-
tory  of  autoimmune  disease.  Another
major  downside  to  using  bovine  colla-
gen  is  the  minimal  durability  of  about 
3 to 4 months.

comparable  to  bovine  collagen  fillers.
Furthermore, 
like  bovine  collagen,
CosmoDerm  and  CosmoPlast  must  be
kept  refrigerated  when  stored.  For
human-derived  collagen  devices,  on
average, one syringe is used for patients
in  their  twenties,  two  syringes  for
patients  in  their  thirties,  three  syringes
for  patients  in  their  forties,  and  as
needed for older patients in order to cor-
rect age-related lines and folds.

Benefits Given  the  absence  of  allergy
risk  associated  with  these  agents,  no
skin testing is required. This allows for
patients to be treated in their initial visit
to the physician. The cosmetic effects of
CosmoDerm and CosmoPlast are imme-
diate, lasting about 3 months for the for-
mer and about 4 months for the latter,19
and  are  typically  associated  with  less
bruising  than  the  effects  of  procedures
using agents containing HA. Also similar
to  the  bovine-derived  fillers,  Cosmo-
Derm and CosmoPlast contain lidocaine
to  mitigate  the  pain  of  injection  and
lower the risk of edema and ecchymoses
activation  of
the 
by 
eosinophils.20 CosmoPlast can create the
beautiful  “Snow  White 
line”  and
“Cupid’s bow” shape of the lip borders
as well as upturn the tip of the nose to
create  a  poised  appearance.  Although
HA fillers are favored because they last
longer and are softer, CosmoDerm I can
be  used  to  plump  the  body  of  the  lip.
CosmoDerm  I  can  be  layered  over
CosmoPlast  for  the  purpose  of  ideal
contouring  of  deep  lines,  such  as
nasolabial folds and marionette lines. In
addition,  to  treat  medium  and  deep
wrinkles,  HA  fillers  can  be  superim-
posed on top of CosmoPlast or injected
in  the  same  plane  as  CosmoPlast.
Although  fillers  should  be  used  rarely
and  with  great  caution  in  the  glabellar
rhytides because of the potential risk of

tissue  necrosis,  CosmoDerm  I  can  be
used  with  great  care  in  this  region.  At
the time of publication of this text, there
were no HA fillers geared for superficial
placement, although Prevelle, Juvéderm,
and  Restylane  may  have  superficial
fillers  soon.  Therefore,  CosmoDerm  I,
although it lasts only about 3 months, is
the  filler  of  choice  for  periorbital  wrin-
kles and smoker’s lines above the top lip.
CosmoDerm  II  is  most  often  used  for
acne scars.

Drawbacks  Bioengineered 
human-
derived  collagen  is  expensive  to  pro-
duce, rendering these agents somewhat
costly. Further, the cosmetic effects from
these  products  do  not  last,  on  average,
any  longer  than  the  bovine-derived
products. The duration is thought to be
around 4 months. However, these prod-
ucts  are  associated  with  less  bruising,
erythema,  and  pain  than  other  filling
agents and, consequently, remain desir-
able  options  for  those  who  cannot
afford to have downtime. Excluding the
reduction  in  immunogenic  potential,
human collagen fillers have similar side
effect profiles to bovine collagen fillers.
Likewise,  patients  with  lidocaine  aller-
gies should avoid these agents.

CADAVERIC COLLAGEN
Overview Approved  by  the  FDA  in 
2000  for  soft  tissue  augmentation,
Cymetra® (LifeCell Corp., Palo Alto, CA)
is  a  micronized  collagen  derived  from
processed human cadaver skin. A similar
product,  Fascian  (Fascia  Biosystems,
Beverly  Hills,  CA),  is  obtained  from
cadaver fascia, and has a heavier consis-
tency. Cymetra is packaged as a 330-mg
white powder in a 5-cc syringe, stored at
room  temperature  and  reconstituted
with  1  mL  of  1%  lidocaine  to  create  a
thick  paste.6 Tunneling  and  threading
injection  methods  are  accomplished

through a 26-gauge syringe into a subcu-
taneous plane, avoiding overcorrection.

Beneﬁts This acellular and purified filler
negates  a  potential  sensitivity  reaction
and pretesting is, therefore, unnecessary.
The  cadaver  collagen  has  somewhat
longer  durability  versus  other  collagen
products,  lasting  from  3  to  9  months,
although  durability  is  controversial.6
Cymetra  is  indicated  for  use  in  deep
rhytides (i.e., nasolabial folds), depressed
scars,  and  volumizing  of  the 
lips.
Reconstitution  with  lidocaine  yields
reduction in intraprocedural pain.

Drawbacks Based on the composition of
the product, Cymetra is contraindicated
in  patients  with  gentamicin  allergies.
The  product  is  very  viscous,  which
makes it difficult to operate, generating
more local tissue discomfort and trauma
as  well  as  leading  to  longer  recovery
time  for  patients.  Fascian  is  an  even
thicker and stiffer product, which trans-
lates  to  more  side  effects  and  difficulty
in  administration.  The  implantation  of
cadaver  products  into  superficial  and
mobile  wrinkles  can  induce  migration
and,  therefore,  is  discouraged.  The
major  issues  with  employing  these
agents are the cumbersome preparations
and  deficit  of  adequate  clinical  trials
demonstrating  their  long-term  efficacy
and safety.

Hyaluronic Acid

In  the  last  few  years,  HA  filler  sub-
stances have become the new gold stan-
dard,  far  outpacing  in  usage  the  other
soft  tissue  augmentation  agents.21 HA,
or  hyaluronan,  is  a  nonsulfated  gly-
cosaminoglycan (GAG) that occurs nat-
urally  in  the  skin  and  other  tissues
(specifically,  connective,  epithelial,  and
neural tissues) as space-occupiers of the

extracellular  matrix.  HA  is  also  ubiqui-
tous across animal species, which makes
it  nonimmunogenic.  This  polysaccha-
ride has the capacity to bind water up to
1000 times its mass. The biologic behav-
ior of HA is predictable; it creates lubri-
cation and volume with an aqueous and
pliable  framework  that  suspends  and
adheres  to  collagen,  elastin,  and  cells.
With  age,  the  concentration  of  HA  in
skin  decreases,  translating  to  more  lax,
sallow,  and  dull  skin.  The  viscoelastic
qualities  of  HA  serve  to  plump  up  the
skin,  yielding  a  more  youthful  appear-
ance.  Naturally-occurring,  unmodified,
or  uncross-linked  HA  has  a  half-life  of
about  24  hours.  For  this  reason,  HA  is
cross-linked  when  formulated  into  a
dermal filler product. Higher concentra-
tions and moderate cross-linking of the
HA 
impart  greater
longevity. There exists a certain thresh-
old where beyond that value additional
cross-linking can cause biocompatibility
issues. In effect, cross-linking has to be
in the right balance to maintain duration
and  biocompatibility  of  the  HA  filler.
HA  is  readily  metabolized  by  the  liver
into  by-products,  water,  and  carbon
dioxide. In the skin, HA is broken down
by  hyaluronidase,  mechanical  degrada-
tion caused by facial movement, and by
free radicals. Supplementation with oral
antioxidants  theoretically  will  increase
the  duration  of  HA  fillers,  but  this  has
not been proven (see Chapter 34).

in  a  product 

There are two main categories of HA
fillers:  animal  derived  (e.g.,  Hylaform)
and  bacteria  derived  (e.g.,  Restylane,
Captique,  Juvéderm,  etc).  Medicis,  the
company  that  sells  Restylane,  trade-
marked  the  name  “nonanimal  derived
synthetic  hyaluronic  acid  (NASHA)”  to
show that their products, Restylane and
Perlane,  are  not  animal  based.  Because
of  the  expense  of  animal-derived  prod-
ucts,  the  vast  majority  of  HA  products
are  bacterial  derived.  At  the  time  this
chapter was written, no HA products on
the  market  contained  lidocaine  and,
therefore, were more painful than fillers
that  contain  lidocaine.  However,  lido-
caine-containing  injectables,  such  as
Prevelle  Silk,  have  recently  entered  the
market.  Because  of  their  nonallergenic
nature and manufacturing, HA fillers do
not  require  prior  testing  and  can  be
stored  at  room  temperature.  Their
advantages  over  collagen  products  are
longer  duration  (6–12  months),  better
pliability,  and  less  immunogenic  and
allergic side effects. On the whole, side
effects of various HA fillers are similar,
mild,  and  rare;  these  include  bruising
(Fig. 23-6), temporary swelling, lumps,

acneiform  eruptions,  and,  rarely,  acute
hypersensitivity.22 In  addition,  arterial
occlusion, thought to be due to swelling
of  the  HA implant,  causing  vascular
compromise, can rarely occur. (Fig. 23-7).
A major advantage of HA fillers is that
if  skin  nodules  do  arise,  these  reactions
can be easily dissolved with intralesional
hyaluronidase (Fig. 23-8). The disadvan-
tages of the currently available HA fillers
are increased pain on injection and post-
procedure edema, erythema, and ecchy-
moses  as  compared  to  CosmoPlast
injections.

CONSIDERATIONS  IN  CHOOSING  AN  HA
FILLER HA  fillers  do  not  require  skin

testing  and  the  risk  of  allergy  with  all
products that are FDA approved is mini-
mal.  Cost,  availability,  duration  of  cor-
rection, and size of the required needle
for  injection  all  play  a  role  in  product
selection and manufacturers all strive to
create an affordable, long-lasting product
that can be injected with a 30-gauge or
smaller  needle.  However,  there  are
other, less obvious, scientific considera-
tions  to  be  taken  into  account  when
choosing  a  filler  (Table  23-3).  The  stiff-
ness or G(cid:6) (G prime) of a product is one
of  the  most  important  considerations.
G(cid:6) is a measurement of gel hardness. It
is  obtained  when  a  gel  is  placed  on  a
plate. A second plate is placed over the

The most likely cause was vascular compromise due to swelling of the implant. All cultures were nega-
tive, other treated sites were normal and the lesions resolved without scarring.

gel  and  a  lateral  force  is  applied.  The
measurement  of  resistance  to  deforma-
tion is known as the elastic modulus or
the  G(cid:6) (Fig.  23-9).  Together  with  the
cohesivity  of  the  product,  G(cid:6) values
could  be  used  to  determine  the  appro-
priate placement of an HA dermal filler.
For  example,  more  robust  products
(higher  G(cid:6) values  and  higher  cohesivi-
ties)  such  as  Juvéderm  Ultra  Plus  and
Perlane, in the primary author’s opinion,
should  be  used  in  deeper  lines,  such  as
nasolabial folds and marionette lines, as
well as to lift the lateral brow, to correct
the  nasal  bridge,  to  give  the  ear  lobe
youthful  volume,  to  evert  the  nipples,
and  to  raise  the  nasal  tip.  More  fluid
products  such  as  Juvéderm  Ultra  and
Restylane  are  better  suited  to  be  used
over large areas such as the cheekbones

and  cheeks.  Low  G(cid:6) products  such  as
Hylaform and Juvéderm Ultra are neces-
sary in areas that require a softer agent,
such  as  the  body  of  the  lip  or  the  tear
trough. As new products reach the mar-
ket, knowing the G(cid:6) will help practition-
ers match fillers with indications.

The concentration of HA in a product is
important to consider as well (Table 23-4).
Many authorities believe that the higher
the concentration of HA, the stiffer the
product and the longer its duration. This
is true in general when comparing prod-
ucts within a brand, for example, when
comparing Juvéderm 18 to Juvéderm 24.
However, this does not hold true across
brands because not all of the HA in the
dermal  fillers  is  cross-linked.  Many  HA
fillers  contain  uncross-linked  HA  and
lightly  cross-linked  chains  and  frag-
ments.  The  uncross-linked  HA,  frag-
ments  of  HA,  and  lightly  cross-linked
HA  are  included  in  the  overall  concen-
tration measurement but only remain in
the  skin  for  a  limited  time  and  should
minimally contribute to the longevity of
the  filler.  The  uncross-linked  HA  does
help decrease extrusion force and make

injection  easier,  which  is  the  main
reason it is included. Therefore, the fact
that Restylane contains 20 mg of HA/cc
and Juvéderm contains 24 mg of HA/cc
does not give a physician enough infor-
mation  to  decide  which  filler  will  have
longer duration. It is actually the amount
of  modified  HA  that  plays  the  primary
role in duration.

The type of modification (cross-link-
ing)  and  the  cross-linking  agent  used  is
also  important.  Cross-linking  can  be
best  visualized  by  imagining  a  ladder
(Fig. 23-10). Each side of the ladder is an
HA  chain.  The  rungs  of  the  ladder  are
the cross-links. When the “rungs” of the
ladder attach to both sides of the ladder,
the agent is considered completely mod-
ified.  However,  the  cross-linking  agent
used  may  incompletely  cross-link  the
chains  of  HA,  leaving  the  sides  of  the
rungs  unattached  and  resulting 
in
incomplete  modification.  Such  a  prod-
uct  might  not  be  as  durable  as  a  com-
pletely  modified  product.  In  addition,
there are two types of rungs in the HA
ladder. One is called an ether linkage and
the other is called an ester linkage. Ether
linkages  are  formed  by  1,4-butanediol
diglycidyl ether (BDDE, the cross-linking
agent  in  Restylane  and  Juvéderm) and
divinyl sulfone (DVS, the agent used in
Prevelle  Silk,  Captique,  and  Hylaform).
The cross-linking agent used in Prevelle
Dura,  1,2,7,8  diepoxyoctane  (DEO),
forms  both  ether  and  ester  linkages
(known  as  “double  cross-linking”).  It  is

unknown at this time what advantages,
if any, ether linkages impart to a dermal
filler.

The hydration status of the filler once
it is packaged in the syringe also affects
filler performance. HA is well known to
bind  up  to  1000  times  its  weight  in
water.  The  amount  of  water  bound  to
the  HA  prior  to  its  packaging  in  the
syringe  determines  how  much  more
water  the  filler  can  absorb  once  it  is
injected  into  the  skin.  In  other  words,
fillers  that  are  completely  hydrated 
in  the  syringe  will  bind  less  water  on
injection  and  the  volume  will  expand
less upon injection as compared to fillers
that are not completely hydrated in the
syringe.  Fillers  that  are  not  completely
hydrated in the syringe will swell some-
what  within  24  hours  after  correction;
therefore, it is prudent to slightly under-
correct  with  these  substances.  In  addi-
tion,  patients  can  be  told  that  they 
will  “look  even  better”  24  hours  after 
the  injection.  Restylane  and  Juvéderm
are not completely hydrated in the syringe
while Captique and Hylaform are close
to being fully hydrated (Table 23-5).

Another  process  that  may  affect  the
performance of the filler is referred to as
“sizing  technology.”  This  term  is  used
by  Allergan  to  differentiate  Juvéderm
from the other HA fillers. When an HA
filler is cross-linked, the chains of modi-
fied sugars form a gel. In the process of
manufacturing  Restylane,  Restylane

Touch,  Perlane,  and  Restylane  Sub-Q,
this  gel  is  extruded  through  a  screen.
This  produces  various  sizes  of  the  gel
that  are  considered  “sized.”  The  large
pieces  become  Perlane  or  Restylane 
Sub-Q,  while  the  small  pieces  are  mar-
keted  as  Restylane  Fine  Line  or
Restylane Lip. The medium-sized pieces
are  Restylane.  The  larger  pieces  yield
products that are best used in the mid to
lower  dermis  while  the  small  pieces
such as Restylane Fine Line can be used
more superficially. The Juvéderm family
of products is not sized. In other words,
Juvéderm is not pushed through a screen
and broken into sized pieces and, there-
fore,  it  consists  of  randomly  sized  and
shaped  pieces.23 It  is  unknown  at  this
time what role sizing technology plays,
if any, in the performance of a filler.

There are many factors that must be
understood  in  order  to  make  the  most
suitable choice of HA filler. There are no
peer-reviewed  publications  that  review
the above mentioned properties so it is
difficult  at  this  point  to  know  how
important  these  various  characteristics
are in choosing a filler. More data need
to  be  collected  to  properly  ascertain  if,
for example, sizing technology makes a
difference  or  if  ester  bonds  last  longer
than  ether  bonds.  These  distinctions
will become clearer and more important
as  more  HA  fillers  are  introduced  onto
the market and more data are collected.
A  discussion  of  the  individual  HA
brands follows.

HYLAFORM (NO LONGER ON THE MARKET)
Overview Although  Hylaform  is  no
longer  on  the  market,  it  will  be  dis-
cussed  because  it  was  the  first  product
on the market that used the DVS cross-
linking system. The knowledge gleaned
from this revolutionary agent has led to
many  spin-off  products  using  similar
technology  such  as  Captique  and
Prevelle.  Hylaform  is  an  animal-based
HA  product  derived  from  rooster
combs.  It  is  produced  by  cross-linking
the hydroxyl groups of HA with DVS to
yield a gel-like substance that is sized by

extruding the gel through a sieve in the
production  process  discussed  above.24
The smallest pieces of the gel are pack-
aged  as  Hylaform  Fine  Line,  which  is
indicated  for  superficial  wrinkles,  but
has never been approved for the US mar-
ket.  Hylaform,  composed  of  medium-
sized (average size 400 (cid:4)m) particles, is
indicated  for  injection  into  the  midder-
mis for medium facial wrinkles and fine
lines.  Hylaform  Plus  is  composed  of
larger  particles  (average  size  700  (cid:4)m)
and is used for deeper furrows. In 2004,
the FDA approved two products in this
family,  Hylaform  and  Hylaform  Plus
(Allergan,  Irvine,  CA),  the  latter  of
which  remains  on  the  US  market.  The
moderate  density  of  cross-linking  ren-
ders the Hylaform fillers biocompatible,
soft, and pliable. The G(cid:6) of this filler is
low  compared  to  other  HA  products 
on  the  market;  therefore,  this  is  the
softest HA filler currently on the mar-
ket.  This  softness  makes  it  an  ideal
filler for use in the lips. The Hylaform
products  contain  5.5  mg/mL  of  cross-
linked HA.

Beneﬁts Hylaform  has  a  low  G(cid:6),  which
means that it is not very stiff and has a
very natural feel in the skin. It is soft and
malleable making it ideal for use in the
body of the lip, smoker’s lines, and the
periorbital tear-trough as well as in large
areas such as the cheekbones and jowls.
Hylaform  is  very  easy  to  inject  with  a
low extrusion force through a 30-gauge
needle. The side effects of Hylaform are
rare, mild, and temporary.

Drawbacks Side  effects,  which  are  rare
and  relatively  mild,  typically  include
bruising,  erythema,  induration,  and
pruritus.25 The  contraindications  for
Hylaform  products  are  similar  to  those
for  most  fillers  (e.g.,  autoimmune  and
inflammatory  disorders,  allergic  back-
ground,  history  of  anaphylactic  reac-
tions, immunosuppressant therapy, and
pregnancy or breastfeeding). In addition,
patients  allergic  to  products  of  avian
origin  (e.g.,  eggs)  cannot  use  these
agents.25,26 Hylaform  is  close  to  being
fully  saturated  with  water 
in  the
syringe;27 therefore,  there  is  no  volume
expansion  of  the  filler  after  injection.
Additionally, the injection of Hylaform,
as with other fillers that do not contain
an  anesthetic,  could  be  painful.  How-
ever, the softness of Hylaform renders it
less  painful  than  other  HA  fillers  to
inject.  The  use  of  topical  anesthetics
reduces  the  pain  on  injection.  The  cos-
metic effects of Hylaform and Hylaform
Plus are believed to last only about 3 to 4

 
 
 
months,  most  likely  because  of  their
cross-linking  properties  and  lower  con-
centration  of  HA  than  the  newer  HA
fillers (e.g., Restylane and Juvéderm).

CAPTIQUE (NO LONGER ON THE MARKET)
Overview Captique  (Allergan,  Irving,
CA) differs from Hylaform only insofar
as  the  former  is  derived  from  bacterial
fermentation rather than rooster combs;
otherwise,  it  is  also  composed  of 
5.5  mg/mL  of  HA.  In  2004,  it  was
approved  by  the  FDA  for  moderate  to
severe  wrinkles.  The  bacterial  origin  of
Captique  renders  it  slightly  stiffer  than
Hylaform, but not as firm as Restylane.
Captique is packaged as a clear gel in a
0.75-mL  syringe  and  injected  dermally
with  a  30-gauge  needle  via  the  serial
puncture  method.  Like  Hylaform,
Captique is no longer available.

Benefits This  product  is  suitable  for
treating  similar  periorbital  and  perioral
wrinkles as Hylaform as well as enhanc-
ing  lip  fullness  and  shallow  scars.  No
testing  or  refrigeration  is  required  and
the  agent  can  be  injected  in  the  initial
physician’s visit. As an HA filler, it has a
low  side  effect  profile  because  of  its
immunogenic  inertness  and  low  likeli-
hood  of  allergic  reactions.  The  equilib-
rium hydration of Captique is also com-
parable to Hylaform, meaning that it is
fully hydrated with water in the syringe.
In  the  primary  author’s  experience,
patients complained of less stinging after
injection  with  Captique  as  compared
with Juvéderm.

Drawbacks The longevity of Captique is
questionable but believed to be about 4
to 6 months. Few duration studies were
performed, however. It has a high extru-
sion  force  when  injected  through  a  30-
gauge  needle,  which  renders  injection
more difficult than that for Hylaform or
Restylane.  Captique  does  not  contain
lidocaine, thus it is similar to other HA
fillers in the capacity to cause moderate
pain,  bruising,  edema,  and  redness  on
injection.  Captique  has  been  taken  off
the market because its parent company,
Allergan,  is  focusing  on  promoting
Juvéderm.

RESTYLANE
Overview Restylane (Medicis, Scottsdale,
AZ) was the first nonanimal HA prod-
uct approved in the US. It is a NASHA
gel  formulated  through  fermentation,
with sugar present, in bacterial cultures
of equine streptococci. Restylane has a
higher  concentration  of  HA  compared
to  Hylaform  and  Captique  and  the

in 

highest G´ of the fillers currently on the
market,  denoting  that  it  is  a  slightly
stiffer product. It is the most popular of
the HA fillers in the US because of its
safety  profile,  brand  recognition,  and
ease  of  injection.  Restylane  is  com-
posed of approximately 100,000 parti-
cles/mL  (approximately  250  (cid:4)m  on
average)28 and  contains  20  mg/mL  of
HA. Restylane is indicated for midder-
mal wrinkle reduction and was the first
HA filler approved in the US in 2003.29
Perlane,  another  product 
the
Restylane  family,  was  more  recently
approved  by  the  FDA  for  significantly
deeper folds and furrows. Restylane is
made of medium-sized particles of HA
gel, while Perlane is composed of larger
HA  gel  particles  (approximately  1000
(cid:4)m),28 but  with  the  same  HA  concen-
tration. The Restylane family of prod-
ucts also includes Restylane Fine Line,
Restylane  Touch,  Restylane  Lip,  and
Restylane  Sub-Q,  which  are  not  cur-
rently  approved  for  use  in  the  US.
These  products  have  the  same  formu-
lation  as  Restylane  and  differ  only  in
their  particle  size.  Restylane  and
Perlane  are  packaged  as  transparent
gels, with a shelf life of 18 months, and
stored at room temperature. Restylane
is  enclosed  in  0.4-  and  1-mL  syringes
while  Perlane  is  packaged  in  a  0.7-mL
syringe;  both  are  injected  via  a  27-
gauge  needle.  Restylane  is  implanted
using  linear  threading  anterograde  or
retrograde  techniques.  It  is  important
to avoid injecting at withdrawal of the
needle,  which  can  result  in  superficial
injection,  creating  blue-colored  nod-
ules.  A  fanning  threading  technique
can  also  be  employed  with  Restylane
at  the  nasolabial  fold  or  lip  commis-
sures.

Beneﬁts The  stiffness  of  Restylane  ren-
ders it well suited for moderate to deep
wrinkles  and  it  is  this  quality  among
other  factors  that  is  thought  to  impart
greater  longevity  in  human  tissue  as
compared  to  Hylaform  and  Captique.
The  cosmetic  effects  of  Restylane  are
thought  to  last  over  6  months;  Perlane
delivers  a  durability  of  6  to  9  months.
Product  stiffness  makes  Restylane  and
Perlane more suitable for moderate and
deep wrinkles than for use in the body
of the lips or the tear trough. Restylane
is ideal to fill nasolabial and marionette
lines,  chin  and  jowl  depressions,  nasal
deformities, and for nasal tip-lift as well
as acne scars and other defects.

Drawbacks Bruising  is  associated  with
all HA fillers. However, the stiffness is

a downside if the product is used by a
poorly  skilled  physician,  with  bumps
and  blue  blebs  possibly  arising  from
improper injection technique. Injection
into the tear trough may result in visi-
ble  blebs.  Slower  injection  of  any  HA
filler will limit the risk of inflammation.
Restylane can be used in the vermilion
border to augment the shape of the lip.
In 
the  primary  author’s  opinion,
Restylane and Perlane are a poor choice
for the body of the lips. However, out-
side  the  US,  Restylane  Lip  is  available
and  is  a  better  choice  for  use  in  this
area.  As  with  other  fillers  that  do  not
contain  an  anesthetic,  the  injection  of
Restylane  can  be  painful.  The  use  of
topical anesthetics and/or dental nerve
blocks  is  recommended  to  reduce  the
pain  on  injection.  Restylane  tends  to
sting  less  after  injection  when  com-
pared to Juvéderm. It is unknown why
this  occurs  as  they  are  both  the  same
pH of approximately 7.0.

JUVÉDERMTM
Overview Juvéderm  (Allergan,  Irvine,
CA), is manufactured by a bacterial fer-
mentation  process  similar  to  that  used
for  other  stabilized  bacterial-based  HA
fillers and was approved by the FDA in
late  2006.  There  are  many  products  in
line 
the 
(Juvéderm  18,
Juvéderm 
Juvéderm  24, 
Juvéderm  24  HV,
Juvéderm 30, and Juvéderm 30 HV), but
only  Juvéderm  24  HV  (also  known  as
Juvéderm  Ultra)  and  Juvéderm  30  HV
(also known as Juvéderm Ultra Plus) are
currently  approved  by  the  FDA  and
sold  in  the  US.  All  the  products  in  the
line vary by the amount of HA concen-
tration,  the  amount  of  cross-linking,
and  the  regularity  of  the  cross-linking.
Both  Juvéderm  Ultra  and  Ultra  Plus
consist  of  24  mg/cc  of  HA,  but
Juvéderm Ultra Plus has a higher degree
of  cross-linking  than  Juvéderm  Ultra,
which  makes  Ultra  Plus  more  suitable
for  the  deepest  facial  grooves  and  fur-
rows. Unlike Restylane, which consists
of  stiff  and  a  fairly  narrow  range  of
particle  sizes,  Juvéderm  is  a  smooth
consistency  gel  composed  of  a  broad
range  of  particles  of  various  sizes  and
shapes30 (referred  to  as  “Hyalacross
technology”).

Juvéderm products are packaged as a
clear  gel  in  0.8-mL  syringes.  They  are
stored at room temperature. Juvéderm
Ultra is injected into the middermis via
a  30-gauge  needle  while  Juvéderm
Ultra Plus is implanted deeper via a 27-
gauge  needle.27 The  needles  must  be
tightly  attached  to  the  Luer-lock
syringe  to  prevent  detachment  during

injections. Various techniques of injec-
tion  can  be  used  with  Juvéderm,
including  serial  puncture  and  tunnel-
ing.

Beneﬁts Juvéderm  Ultra  and  Ultra  Plus
are  in  the  medium  range  of  stiffness;
therefore, they can be used in any wrin-
kles,  moderate  or  deep,  and  to  correct
scars. Juvéderm Ultra is easily placed in
the vermilion border or the body of the
lips.  The  high  concentration  of  HA  in
Juvéderm  Ultra  and  Ultra  Plus  and  the
high  degree  of  cross-linking  results  in
longer-lasting  aesthetic  effects  as  com-
pared to products such as Hylaform. As
other  HA  products,  these  agents  have
an  overall  low,  mild,  and  transient
adverse-event  profile.  Juvéderm  is  not
completely hydrated in the syringe,27 so
it will slightly expand after injection as
it absorbs more water. This is important
to  remember  when  injecting  the  body
of  the  lips,  which  should  be  slightly
undercorrected  to  allow  for  the  expan-
sion. Similar to Restylane, the longevity
of  Juvéderm  Ultra  is  about  6  to  9
months and Ultra Plus may last up to 12
months.

Drawbacks All  HA  products  can  cause
erythema,  swelling,  and  bruising  after
implantation (see Chapter 21). Pain dur-
ing  injection  caused  by  lack  of  anes-
thetic can be alleviated with the use of
topical or regional anesthesia. Juvéderm
can  be  placed  with  care  in  the  tear
trough  area,  but  the  proximity  to  the
eye  is  unnerving  with  the  risk  of  the
needle popping off, so injections should
be very slow with only moderate extru-
sion force. The needle is more likely to
pop  off  when  the  syringe  is  almost
empty;  therefore,  the  tear  trough  area
should  be  injected  with  a  new  syringe
and  the  last  part  of  the  syringe  can  be
saved  for  less  dangerous  areas  such  as
the  nasolabial  folds.  As  with  all  fillers,
the skill and experience of the physician
is  crucial  for  optimal  outcome.  If
Juvéderm is injected too superficially, it
can create a bluish hue. Caution should
be taken in overinjecting the vermilion
border and creating an unnatural “duck-
bill” appearance. In addition, superficial
placement  of  Juvéderm  in  the  tear
trough  defects  can  result  in  blue  nod-
ules. Blue nodules and unwanted bulges
can  be  corrected  with  the  use  of
hyaluronidase.

PREVELLE SILK
Overview Prevelle  Silk  is  sold  by  the
Mentor Corp. (Santa Barbara, CA). This
bacterial-derived  product  is  similar  to

200

the  Captique  formulation  with  moder-
ate  softness  illustrated  by  its  G´  in  the
middle of the spectrum. This product is
softer  than  Restylane  and  is  similar  in
softness to Juvéderm. Prevelle Silk has a
higher  degree  of  cross-linking  density
than  Hylaform  and  therefore  is  slightly
stiffer  than  Hylaform.  The  gel  contains
5.5  mg/mL  of  cross-linked  HA  with  an
average particle size of 300 (cid:4)m. Prevelle
is suitable for treating shallow to moder-
ate  wrinkles, 
lips,  and  scars.  The
longevity of the product is unknown but
reported to be about 4 months. Prevelle
Silk  contains  0.3%  lidocaine.  It  was
approved  in  the  United  States  in  2008.
This product is suitable for use in the lips
since it generates less pain during injec-
tions. Side effects, which are rare and rel-
atively  mild,  include  redness,  swelling,
and pruritus.

Benefits This  product  is  softer  than
other  products  on  the  market  since
Hylaform and Captique were discontin-
ued.  It  can  be  used  in  any  moderate  to
deep facial wrinkles, the body of the lip,
and  periorbital  areas.  Prevelle  Silk  is 
the first lidocaine-containing HA in the
United States.

Drawbacks Longevity  of  the  correction
is  not  known  but  thought  to  be  4-6
months.

PREVELLE DURA
Overview Prevelle  Dura  (Mentor  Corp.)
is  another  bacterial-derived 
filler
approved for the US market in 2008. It is
composed of 220-μm HA particles cross-
linked  with  DEO.  As  mentioned  previ-
ously, DEO cross-linking results in both
ether bonds and ester bonds, known as
double cross-linking. These ester bonds
may  confer  better  stability  and  longer
duration  but  this  has  not  yet  been
proven.31 Prevelle  Dura  is  touted  for
suitability in any dermal layer to correct
middermal  and  deep  rhytides.  The  G(cid:6)
(stiffness)  of  this  product  is  900  Da,
which  renders  it  slightly  stiffer  than
Restylane.

Benefits Preliminary  studies  demon-
strate the safety of this product;31 how-
ever, more trials need to be performed to
establish  its  strengths  and  weaknesses.
Based  on  double  cross-linking  technol-
ogy, the company claims that this device
may last longer than previous HA fillers;
however, this has not been proven. The
role of the double cross-linking technol-
ogy in terms of duration of the filler has
not been ascertained.

Drawbacks Prevelle  Dura  is  slightly
more  viscous  and,  therefore,  requires
more pressure on injection.

Hyaluronidase

Hyaluronidase is a soluble enzyme that
hydrolyzes HA, other GAGs, and other
connective tissue components in the skin
and  vitreous  humor  of  the  eye.32 It  has
been  approved  by  the  FDA,  as  Vitrase
and  Amphadase,  for  enhancement  of
injectable  drug  absorption  and  resorp-
tion  of  radiopaque  agents.  However,
effective  off-label  uses  include  wound
care  and  postsurgical  flap  care  among
other uses.

impending 

Several  reports  have  indicated  the
usefulness  of  hyaluronidase  to  dissolve
HA  filler  overcorrection  for  symmetric
contouring, as well as to manage impend-
ing  tissue  necrosis  because  of  HA  skin
injections.33–35 Specifically,  Hirsch  et  al.
published  two  cases  of  imminent  tissue
necrosis caused by intra-arterial injection
of  HA  and  surrounding  tissue  compres-
sion of vital vessel, which resolved with
employment  of  hyaluronidase.  After
using  other  appropriate  techniques  to
manage 
tissue  necrosis
including  systemic  aspirin,  Nitro  BID
under occlusion, and hot compresses with
massage without significant response, the
authors injected 30 units of hyaluronidase
into deep dermal tissue and subcutis using
a  serial  puncture  method  along  the
distribution of affected arteries, which led
to  the  resolution  of  symptoms  within  a
day.32,33 Although early reports have rec-
ommended  the  utility  of  hyaluronidase
only  within  16  minutes  of  the  critical
event,  Hirsch  et  al.  reported  successful
responses  after  several  days.32 Further-
more, the effectiveness of hyaluronidase
for  bluish  (Tyndall)  manifestations  and
asymmetric lumpiness from HA overcor-
rection has also been reported at various
concentrations.34–36

Because  of  the  described  benefits  of
hyaluronidase for the treatment of com-
plications  of  the  popular  HA  fillers,  it
has  been  recommended  as  a  necessary
agent to keep in an aesthetic physician’s
office.37 Hyaluronidase  is  a  clear  liquid
that  is  stored  in  the  refrigerator  and
reconstituted with 1 mL of normal saline
to generate 150 units. Very rare adverse
acute and delayed-type hypersensitivity
reactions  to  hyaluronidase  have  been
reported,  so  it  may  be  prudent  to
perform  a  skin  test  prior  to  the  use  of
this  agent.  Injection  of  hyaluronidase
into  patients  with  an  allergy 
to
hymenoptera  stings  and  thimerosal  is
contraindicated.33,38

 
 
 
Semipermanent Fillers

Fat,  Radiesse,  and  Sculptra  are  consid-
ered  semitransitory  because  they  are
partly  biostimulatory  and  partially
biodegradable; this balance allows them
to last approximately 1 to 3 years.39 The
adverse events associated with semiper-
manent  fillers  include  rare  granuloma
formations.  The  aesthetic  effects  of
these  fillers  are  best  preserved  with
annual touch-up sessions.

AUTOLOGOUS FAT
Overview Originating 
in  the  1890s,
transplantation  of  fat  from  a  patient’s
excess  adipose  areas  to  other  skin
defects is the oldest soft tissue augmen-
tation  method.1 Fat  injection  filling  has
gained  recognition  for  several  reasons.
Naturally,  the  patient’s  own  cells  are
unlikely  to  cause  sensitivity  or  inflam-
mation  and  are  therefore  considered
supremely biocompatible. Furthermore,
the  technique  of  fat  implantation  has
undergone  remarkable  polishing  over
many years, especially with the advent
of  harvesting  subcutis  through  liposuc-
tion.  The  procedure  is  a  multistep
process,  whereby  the  fat  cells  are
obtained  from  the  buttock,  thigh,  and
abdominal  regions,  then  segregated,
stored  (refrigerated  up  to  18  months),
and injected back into the patient’s sub-
cutis on the face, hands, and any other
areas  requiring  volume  enhancement.
As anticipated, this process is more inva-
sive, time-consuming, both for the clini-
cian  to  prepare  and  perform  as  well  as
the  patient  to  recover  from,  as  well  as
more  costly.  In  effect,  the  optimal  effi-
cacy  with  minimal  adverse  effects  is
mainly achieved in the hands of a quali-
fied  dermasurgeon.  Approximately  0.1
cc  aliquots  of  fat  are  inserted  into  sub-
cutis  through  a  17-  to  18-gauge  needle
via a tunneling technique, without over-
correction.40 Postprocedure  massage  is
recommended  for  proper  shaping  of
contours.

Beneﬁts Because of its autologous char-
acter,  lipotransfer  is  unlikely  to  cause
sensitivity  and  reactivity  of  the  tissue,
minimizing  potential  long-term  side
effects  and  obviating  prior  testing.
Nasolabial  folds,  sunken  cheeks,  tear
troughs, marionette lines, scars, and lips
are  the  most  appropriate  areas  of  cor-
rection with fat. Furthermore, fat trans-
fer  provides  a  reported  duration  of
about 12 months; although the concrete
duration  is  controversial.41 Because  the
injectable material used is the patient’s
own  tissue,  its  use  decreases  the

amount  of  money  spent  on  the  actual
filler. The procedure also has an attrac-
tive  double-gain,  where  two  cosmetic
areas can be simultaneously addressed,
lipoexcess  and  lipodystrophy.  Stem
cells have been isolated from fat cells. It
is believed that the stem cells found in
fat  lead  to  increased  skin  rejuvenation
(see  Chapter  3).  When  performed  by  a
skilled  physician,  the  results  of  lipo-
transfer are remarkable.42

Drawbacks Fat  injections  require  pro-
phylactic  local  or  regional  anesthesia.
Because of the fact that the procedure is
more surgically invasive, more complex
preparations  and  settings  are  required
with  longer  and  more  frequent  office
visits.  Although  the  harvesting  portion
can cause a longer recovery time and an
increased risk of side effects (e.g., infec-
tion, scarring), the actual injection has a
similar adverse event profile to the other
fillers  (e.g.,  edema,  redness,  bruising,
and  discomfort  lasting  a  few  days).34
Another  variable  to  consider  when
selecting candidates for this procedure is
to ensure that the patient has a sufficient
graft  supply.  In  some  patients,  the  fat
injections last several years and in other
patients  the 
last  merely
injections 
months.  Many  tricks  are  employed  to
try  and  increase  longevity,  but  at  this
time there are no guarantees.32

RADIESSE
Overview Radiesse  (BioForm  Medical,
San  Mateo,  CA)  was  approved  by  the
FDA in 2006 for the correction of mod-
erate to severe folds and wrinkles along
with  HIV-associated  lipoatrophy.  It  is
composed of 30% calcium hydroxylap-
atite  (CaHA)  microspheres  (25–45  μm)
suspended  in  an  aqueous  gel  carrier
(1.3% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,
6.4% glycerin, and 36.6% sterile water).
As the gel carrier of this filler dissipates
in  several  months,  the  microspheres
stimulate  cutaneous  cells  to  generate
focal foreign body reaction and neocol-
lagenesis.32,33 This leads to envelopment
of the microspheres by fibrin, collagen,
and fibroblasts, and slows the degrada-
tion  by  macrophages  and  metabolism
ions.
into  calcium  and  phosphate 
Because of a similar mineral constitution
as  human  bones,  and  no  foreign  anti-
genic  properties,  CaHA  is  particularly
biocompatible.  It  is  critical  for  patients
to  be  aware  that  Radiesse  is  a  radio-
opaque  material  that  can  be  visualized
and  misinterpreted  on  facial  radi-
ographs,  but  importantly,  it  does  not
surrounding
radiographically  mask 
tissues.

Radiesse is a white material packaged
in a 1-mL syringe and injected via a 25-
to  27-gauge  and  11/4-inch  needle  into
the  deep  dermis  or  subcutis  without
overcorrection.33 The product should be
stored  at  room  temperature.  A  reason-
able  injection  method  for  Radiesse  is
tunneling  or  crisscross  threading  tech-
niques.32 A placement of Radiesse in the
supraperiosteal  plane  yields  better  con-
trol and ability to contour skin with this
stiffer filler.43

Beneﬁts Since  Radiesse  is  immunologi-
cally inert, it does not require skin test-
ing. With more than 20 years of use as
implantable  devices  for  otolaryngology
and  orthopedic  specialties,  CaHA  pos-
sesses  an  excellent  safety  record.  The
average  duration  of  Radiesse  is  9  to 
18  months.  The  proper  locations  of
injection  include  the  nasolabial  folds,
marionette  lines,  prejowl  sulcus,  and
cheek  depressions.  Unlike  Sculptra,
where time is necessary to build up new
collagen,  Radiesse  offers  the  advantage
of 
ablation.
Interestingly, although Radiesse induces
foreign body reaction, it is not known to
cause  granuloma  formation.36 In  its  gel
form,  the  device  is  also  quite  pliable,
permitting  timely  manipulation  and
appropriate modification. In addition, it
can be combined with other fillers, such
as Sculptra, HA, and collagen.

immediate  wrinkle 

Drawbacks The  main  drawback  of
Radiesse  is  that  it  is  not  reversible  like
HAs. Radiesse also does not contain an
anesthetic  and  because  of  its  high  vis-
cosity, requires administration through a
high-bore  needle.  However,  Radiesse
can  be  combined  with  lidocaine  in  the
syringe  to  decrease  pain  on  injection.
Hence,  the  use  of  topical  or  regional
anesthesia  is  recommended.  Minimal
side effects such as ecchymoses, edema,
and  erythema  appear  soon  after
Radiesse  injection  and  are  transitory.
Rare nodules have also been associated
with Radiesse and can be managed with
intralesional steroids or excision. Similar
to Sculptra, an implantation of Radiesse
in  the  superficial  and  mobile  wrinkles
(e.g.,  lips  and  periorbital  area)  and  the
body of the lips is discouraged because
of  the  palpable  and  visible  white
papules that can develop (also known as
“popcorn lips”). Radiesse should not be
performed in the nose of a patient antic-
ipating rhinoplasty. Several facial plastic
surgeons have given anecdotal reports in
lectures suggesting that this complicates
rhinoplasty  surgery.  An  HA  or  collagen
filler  would  be  a  more  appropriate

SCULPTRA
Overview. Sculptra 
is  a  synthetic,
biodegradable, biocompatible, immuno-
logically  inert  peptide  polymer  (also
as  NewFill).44–46
known 
Sculptra
(Dermik  Laboratories,  Sanofi-Aventis,
Bridgewater, NJ) is composed of poly-L-
lactic acid (PLLA) microspheres, sodium
carboxymethylcellulose,  and  nonpyro-
genic  mannitol  and  is  manufactured
from  powdered,  absorbable  suture
material (e.g., Vycryl). This agent is not a
true dermal filler because it does not fill
the dermis the way collagen and HA do
but,  rather,  it  promotes  the  production
of  new  and  organized  collagen  in  the
dermis. Many physicians refer to it as a
“dermal stimulator.” Sculptra is thought
to foster neocollagenesis by stimulating
fibroblasts and gradually restoring facial
volume.47–49 However, Sculptra is even-
tually  cleared  from  the  skin  via  phago-
cytic digestion. In the US, Sculptra was
approved  by  the  FDA  in  2004  for  the
treatment of HIV-associated facial lipoa-
trophy, but it has been used off-label for
cosmesis,  and  Dermik  is  currently
applying for approval for its use in facial
rejuvenation.  NewFill  has  been  used  in
Europe and Asia for many years. When
it  was  first  introduced,  NewFill  was
diluted  with  a  lower  amount  of  saline
and  many  granules  and  nodules  were
reported. This led to new recommenda-
tions to dilute one bottle with 5 to 10 cc
of sterile water and massage after appli-
cation. With the new recommendations,
adverse events have been minimal.

Freeze-dried  Sculptra  powder 
is
stored  at  room  temperature  and  recon-
stituted approximately 2 to 4 hours prior
to  injection.  The  package  label  states
that the product should be used within
72  hours.  In  our  practice,  we  prefer
using  Sculptra  that  has  been  reconsti-
tuted  for  at  least  2  days  because  the
solution is easy to work with and results
in less needle clogging. Sculptra is recon-
stituted and kept in the refrigerator for 2
days to 2 weeks. Although the package
label  recommends  that  the  formulation
be  reconstituted  with  5  cc  of  sterile
water,  many  physicians  reconstitute
with 4 mL of sterile water and 1 mL of
2%  lidocaine  with  epinephrine.  The
lidocaine  decreases  pain  while  the  epi-
nephrine reduces bruising. Strong agita-
tion  of  the  filed  syringes  is  recom-
mended  directly  before  injection  to
homogenize  the  white  suspension.
(Sculptra tends to settle in the bottom of
the syringe.) By means of tunneling and

threading techniques, a 25- or 26-gauge
needle  is  utilized  to  implant  Sculptra
into  overlapping  deep  dermal  and  sub-
cutaneous layers of the skin.

The mechanism of action and proper
technique  of  injecting  Sculptra  require
practitioners  to  restore  volume  to  a
selected  treatment  plane  rather  than  a
specific  wrinkle.50
Indeed,  injecting
Sculptra  is  more  similar  to  fat  injection
procedures  than  collagen  or  HA  injec-
tions,  because  it  serves  to  sculpt  the
prominent  hollows  and  deep  grooves
associated with loss of deep soft tissue.
In  addition,  specialized  training  to  use
Sculptra  is  required  prior  to  injections.
Small and exact aliquots of Sculptra are
injected in the correct tissue plane with-
out overcorrection. In general, 2 to 3 cc
of  the  product  are  used  for  patients  in
their  thirties,  4  cc  for  patients  in  their
forties,  and  5  cc  or  more  for  older
patients. The cost is approximately $230
per syringe.

Once  Sculptra  is  injected,  there  is  a
transient period lasting about 1 hour dur-
ing  which  the  patient  can  see  a  slight
effect  because  of  the  volume  of  fluid
injected.  Once  this  resolves,  results  are
not seen until about 4 weeks after treat-
ment when results may begin to appear.
Injections  are  performed  on  a  monthly
basis  until  desired  results  have  been
obtained.  The  number  of  injection  ses-
sions required varies greatly from person
to  person  and  it  is  difficult  to  predict  the
total number of sessions needed. Injections
are  performed  3  to  6  weeks  apart.
Anecdotal  reports  state  that  premeno-
pausal  women  and  postmenopausal
women on hormone replacement therapy
(HRT)  require  fewer  sessions  than  post-
menopausal  women  not  on  HRT.
Postmenopausal  women  not  on  HRT
may  require  up  to  eight  sessions.  Men
tend  to  correct  more  quickly  than
women  for  unknown reasons.  After  the
procedure,  the  patient’s  skin  is  strenu-
ously  massaged  with  topical  arnica  (for
its  anticoagulant  properties)  for  about 
5  minutes  to  reduce  bruising,  pain,  and
nodule formation. Patients should be told
to massage the treated area for 5 minutes
every night for five nights.

Sculptra treatments can be combined
with  other  fillers  for  instant  gratifica-
tion.  In  this  case,  Sculptra  is  injected
first,  the  massage  with  arnica  is  per-
formed,  and  then  the  HA  or  collagen
filler  is  applied  in  the  treatment  area.
Sculptra is often used in the cheeks and
cheekbone  area  while  an  HA  filler  is
used in the nasolabial folds, marionette
lines, and the lips. Alternatively, a course
of  three  to  four  Sculptra  treatments  is

used and then an HA filler is used after
Sculptra at the last visit. Sculptra should
always  be  used  first,  then  massaged,
before  the  HA  is  injected  so  that  the
the
lidocaine  and  epinephrine 
Sculptra will reduce the pain and bruis-
ing of the HA injection, and the massag-
ing will not affect the placement of the
HA filler.

in 

Beneﬁts Sculptra  does  not  require  prior
skin  testing.  It  is  ideal  for  treating  vol-
ume loss in the cheeks, nasolabial folds,
and  the  malar  area.  Once  the  desired
result is achieved, results last about 18 to 
24  months.42,44,51,52 The  correction  is
very natural looking. Having been used
successfully  in  various  medical  devices
for  more  than  30  years,  PLLA  has  an
established  safety  record.53 Moreover,
new  product  guidelines  and  injection
techniques  (e.g.,  using  a  more  dilute
product,  avoiding  overcorrection,  not
injecting too superficially, and postinjec-
tion  massage)  have  reduced  the  inci-
dence  of  side  effects  (i.e.,  formation  of
granulomas  and  nodules)  as  compared
to  when  the  product  was  originally
packaged as NewFill.54

Drawbacks  Sculptra  injection  results  are
not immediate and multiple courses are
required to achieve the optimal cosmetic
effect,  with  the  number  of  treatments
depending  on  volume  of  the  defect
being  treated.45 Preinjection  reconstitu-
tion can contribute to scheduling limita-
tions because it must be made at least 2
hours  in  advance.  Injecting  suspension
can be slightly difficult because of recur-
rent clogging of the needles, which leads
to  frequent  needle  changes.  Adverse
events  are  rare,  but  PLLA  can  cause
postinjection  site  pain,  bruising,  and
swelling, as compared to other products,
partly because of the larger needle used.
Adding  lidocaine  to  the  diluent  miti-
gates injection pain. Ecchymoses can be
reduced by mixing epinephrine into the
PLLA  suspension  and  taking  bromelain
supplements  (500  mg  twice  daily)  after
injection (see Chapter 21). Hyperkinetic
areas (e.g., crow’s feet and the corner of
the  mouth)  and  regions  with  thin  skin
(e.g.,  around  the  eyes,  smoker’s  lines
above  the  lips)  should  not  be  treated
with  Sculptra  because  of 
irregular
papules  that  can  emerge.  Most  lumps
that do arise are from superficial admin-
istration of Sculptra and are not visible,
although  they  are  palpable  by  the
patient.  Reassuring  patients  that  these
lumps  are  transient  in  nature  is  impor-
tant.  Nodule  and  hematoma  formation
are  the  other  rare  adverse  effects  that

have been reported, but are less likely if
the  new  injection  guidelines  are  fol-
lowed.55,56 Sculptra  injection  technique
is  very  different  than  that  of  HA  fillers
and the learning curve is higher. In addi-
tion, there is lack of reversibility as with
HA fillers. Specialized training is required
by  the  manufacturers  of  Sculptra  before
they will sell the product to a physician.

Permanent Fillers

Although the current momentum in the
cosmetic market is toward the less inva-
sive procedures, which are safer, perma-
nent fillers are very popular outside the
US because of the lower cost. Many of
these  products  are  used  by  unskilled
practitioners  and  lead  to  disfiguring
results. If practitioners are to use a per-
manent  filler,  they  should  be  skilled  in
the  technique  and  certain  of  the
patient’s  expectations.  In  the  primary
author’s opinion, it is best to use a tem-
porary  filler  first,  to  make  sure  that  a
patient is pleased, before proceeding to a
permanent  or  semipermanent  option.
Newer  fillers  (e.g.,  Artefill)  as  well  as
older fillers (e.g., silicone) are being used
for  this  purpose.  These  nonbiodegrad-
able fillers stay enclosed by the skin for
an  indeterminate  and  lasting  period  of
time. However, these fillers are not to be
used  for  and  by  the  lighthearted.  They
are associated with rare, significant side
effects  such  as  granulomas,  migration,
and asymmetry and are best implanted
into  a  patient  experienced  with  prior
soft tissue augmentations and by a profi-
cient physician. Remember, as with any-
thing  enduring,  if  one  is  not  pleased
with  the  results,  one  has  to  live  with
long-term consequences.

ARTEFILL
Overview  In  October  2006,  the  FDA
approved  the  novel  permanent  filler
Artefill (Artes Medical, Inc., San Diego,
CA)  for  the  correction  of  nasolabial
folds.57 Artefill is constituted with 20%
homogenous  polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA) suspended in equilibrium with
partly  denatured  3.5%  bovine  collagen
(from  enclosed  US  cattle  herds)  and
0.3% lidocaine. As opposed to the origi-
nal  European  product,  Artecoll,  which
contained different size microspheres of
PMMA that potentially contributed to a
higher  risk  of  granulomas,  Artefill  is
composed  of  uniform  size  PMMA
microspheres  (30–50  (cid:4)m)  that  are  less
likely to result in the formation of gran-
ulomas.  Small  size,  uniformity,  and
smoothness are refined characteristics of
Artefill  that  promote  biocompatibility

and  resistance  to  phagocytic  degrada-
tion  and  migration  as  well  as  ensure
encapsulation by patients’ collagen lead-
ing to lasting nonimmunogenic results.

Artefill  is  packaged  in  a  kit  of  three
0.8-mL and two 0.4-mL syringes that are
injected through a 26-gauge needle into
subdermal and subcutaneous space via a
tunneling technique without overcorrec-
tion.33 After injection, gentle massage is
recommended  to  evenly  distribute
material in the skin and prevent clump-
ing. Artefill must be stored via refrigera-
tion (2(cid:2)C–10(cid:2)C) and warmed before use.
In order to achieve optimal correction of
rhytides,  two  to  three  treatment  ses-
sions,  a  few  months  apart,  are  sug-
gested.51 Like Sculptra, specific injection
training for Artefill is required.

Beneﬁts Artefill offers the dual action of
immediate wrinkle correction from col-
lagen  (lasting  about  1–3  months)  and
permanent  deep-fold  ablation  from
PMMA (lasting for more than 5 years).51
The long-term efficacy is believed to be
because  of  the  stimulatory  influence  of
PMMA on the surrounding skin, causing
fibroblast  and  collagen  proliferation
around  the  material  starting  at  1
month.33 Although  approved  only  for
nasolabial  folds,  PMMA  has  also  been
successfully used in other deeper defects
(e.g.,  the  cheek  and  malar  regions).
Lidocaine content eliminates the neces-
sity for alternative anesthesia and allevi-
ates  intrainjection  discomfort.  As  com-
pared  to  the  standard  of  bovine
collagen,  PMMA  filler  has  been  found
to be superior in efficacy with a compa-
rable  safety  profile.51 Widely  used  in
implantable  medical  devices  for  more
than 50 years, PMMA has a long safety
record.32

Drawbacks Artefill contains bovine colla-
gen; therefore, skin testing prior to injec-
tions is  strongly  advised  to  reduce 
the  incidence  of  hypersensitivity.  This
means that patients cannot be treated on
the  initial  office  visit.  Furthermore,
because  of  Artefill’s  higher  viscosity,
more administration pressure is required
by the clinician, and the product is more
difficult  to  inject  than  collagen  and  HA
fillers.  Although  the  majority  of  side
effects  caused  by  Artefill  are  mild  and
transient (e.g., swelling, redness, hyper-
sensitivity,  and  temporary  lumpiness,
which  is  amenable  to  massage),  rare
moderate-to-severe  effects  have  been
reported  (e.g.,  granuloma  and  inflamed
nodule  formation,  manageable  with
intralesional  steroids  or  excision).51
Because of the reported lumpiness with

this product, it is currently discouraged
for  lip  augmentation  or  any  superficial
wrinkle  correction.  Having  to  inject
through  a  larger  bore  needle  may 
induce  more  posttreatment  edema  and
ecchymoses,  which  require  slightly
longer  downtime.  The  disadvantage  of
implanting  permanent  fillers  such  as
Artefill  is  the  inability  to  foretell  the
long-term  appearance  of  the  patient;
since the skin changes with age, the nat-
ural look may be altered. Time will tell
the  exact  risk-to-benefit  ratio  of  this
filler.

SILICONE
Overview  Silicone 
is  composed  of
dimethylsiloxane  chains  linked  by  oxy-
gen  with  varied  viscosity  based  on  the
length  of  the  polymer.  Used  in  patients
since  the  1940s,  the  liquid  form  of  this
product  is  one  of  the  oldest  soft  tissue
augmentation materials.58 The use of this
injectable  filler  is  fraught  with  contro-
versy because the initial unpurified prod-
uct was associated with long-term disfig-
uring  side  effects,  including  migration
and  granuloma  formation.  It  was  illegal
to perform silicone injections in the US in
some  states  until  recently.  However,
because of the purification of liquid sili-
cone  and  honing  of  the  injection  tech-
nique,  this  soft  tissue  filler  has  returned
and is very popular in Brazil. At the turn
of  the  21st  century,  the  FDA  approved
two  forms  of  medical-grade  silicone 
oils:  ADATO  (or  Sil-ol  5000,  Bausch  &
Lomb Surgical, Inc., San Dimas, CA) with
5000 centistoke (cs) viscosity and Silikon
1000  (Alcon  Laboratories,  Inc.,  Fort
Worth, TX) with 1000 cs viscosity. These
are  both  indicated  for  the  ophthalmo-
logic  uses  of  retinal  temponade  and
detachment.32,33 Although  neither  of
these  products  have  been  approved  by
the FDA as skin injectables, they are used
off-label. Furthermore, there are ongoing
studies in the US assessing the safety and
efficacy  of  SilSkin (a  1000  cs,  highly
purified  polydimethylsiloxane,  OFAS-
Therapeutic  Silicone  Technologies,  Inc.,
New  York,  NY)  for  the  correction  of
nasolabial  folds  and  HIV-associated
lipoatrophy. Pilot studies in patients with
HIV-lipoatrophy  have  revealed  satisfac-
tory results with minimal side effects.59

Similar  to  PMMA  and  PLLA,  silicone
oil biostimulates the surrounding skin to
slowly generate a focal fibro-granuloma-
tous  reaction  that  leads  to  a  permanent
volumizing.  Zappi  et  al.  analyzed  the
microscopic  biologic  behavior  of  liquid
silicone  and  concluded  that  it  was  an
effective,  durable  (up  to  23  years),  and
filler.60

Silikon  1000  is  the  preferred  injectable
filler over ADATO because of its lower
viscosity  and  therefore  easier  injectabil-
ity. It is stored at room temperature and
packaged as clear oil. The proficiency in
the injection technique is the crucial vari-
able  in  achieving  successful  soft  tissue
augmentation with silicone. The favored
technique  is  a  serial  puncture  of  micro-
droplets  and  subdermal  implantation  of
0.01 to 0.02 mL silicone aliquots at 2- to
4-mm intervals using a glass syringe with
a  30-mL  needle.32,52 The  key  is  not  to
overcorrect.  Instead,  patients  should
anticipate steady changes with multiple
treatment sessions, 1 to 2 months apart,
in order to achieve the most natural and
safe outcome in several months.

Benefits Since  it  is  immunologically
inert,  no  prior  skin  testing  is  required.
Practitioners  with  experience  in  using
Silikon  have  reported  its  value  in  cor-
recting  wrinkles  and  scars,  augmenting
lips, and panfacial contouring of deeper
folds  and  valleys.61 Its  low  cost  and
longevity are obvious benefits.

long-term 

Drawbacks As with any temporary filler,
potential 
consequences
should  be  broached  when  discussing
this  treatment  option  with  patients.
Most  side  effects  associated  with  med-
ical-grade  silicone  injectables  are  mini-
mal  and  include  anticipated  temporary
pain,  edema,  bruising,  and  redness.53
The pain is likely because of the absence
of anesthetic as part of the product for-
mulation,  so  appropriate  preprocedure
anesthesia should be provided. However,
it is important to keep in mind that rare
reports  of  appropriately-injected,  puri-
fied silicone causing significant nodules,
granulomas,  cellulitis,  and  ulceration
also exist.53 The skill of the physician is
crucial as this is a permanent filler. The
primary  author  has  seen  myriad
unhappy  patients  who  have  lumps  and
asymmetry  after  treatment  by  other
physicians  (Figs.  23-11 and 23-12).  In
addition, many patients who are treated
by  nonphysicians  are  treated  with
impure silicone. This results in disfigur-
ing edema and long-term complications.
In our clinic, we have tried to treat com-
plications of silicone injections by non-
physicians  with  injectable  steroids,
tacrolimus,  cyclosporine,  and  Aldara
with  minimal  and  short-term  improve-
ment.  Surgical  excision  has  remained
the only effective long-term treatment.

mentation,  several  forms  of  expanded
polytetrafluoroethylene  (PTFE)  are  cur-
rently on the market: Gore-Tex strings or
strands  (Gore  Advanced  Technologies
Worldwide, Newark, DE); Soft-Form and
UltraSoft  tubes  (Tissue  Technologies,
Inc., San Francisco, CA); and newer dual-
porous,  soft,  varied-shape  Advanta

(Atrium  Medical  Corporation,  Hudson,
NH).62,63 PTFE  is  a  synthetic  material
used  in  medical  devices  since  the  1970s
with  a  good  safety  record.  These  are
spongy products that provide significant
volume enhancement and stimulate local
tissue  fibrosis  and  integration,  which
relays permanence and stability. PTFE is

biocompatible  with  rare  instances  of
inflammatory reactions.

The extended PTFE subdermal implants
require a more invasive procedure via sur-
gical  implantation,  which  translates  to
higher procedural risks and the necessity
for a more specialized setting and training.
Because  of  these  complex  features  and
generally lower physician satisfaction, the
use  of  these  devices  by  cosmetic  derma-
tologists is not popular.57

Beneﬁts PTFE fillers have been shown to
impart  an  enduring  correction  of  the
nasolabial  folds,  marionette  lines,  malar
and  mandibular  deficits,  and  enhance-
ment  of  the  lips.56 Additionally,  these
products  do  not  require  prior  testing
because  of 
inertness.
Although  the  implants  are  considered
permanent,  if  patients  are  dissatisfied
with their image alterations, the products
can be removed in bulk within 3 months.

immunologic 

Drawbacks The side effects of bleeding,
bruising,  redness,  postoperative  pain,
scarring,  palpability,  and  secondary
infection  occur  more  frequently  with
PTFE  fillers  as  compared  to  HA  fillers
and the recovery time is longer.64 These
products  have  high  displacement  and
extrusion  rates  and  an  unnaturally  stiff
appearance.58
In  addition,  they  can
shrink with time leading to an asymmet-
ric correction.

Fillers on the Horizon

As  noninvasive  cosmetic  interventions
have become more prominent, the man-
ufacturing  market  has  responded  by
developing  newer  products.  In  fact,
there are so many products to consider,
it has become ever more challenging for
regulatory  organizations,  physicians,
and patients to discern their differences.
While  some  clinicians  opt  to  jump  on
the  bandwagon  and  use  novel  filling
agents  by  interpreting  newer  as  better,
others  await  satisfactory  clinical  evi-
dence before integrating these fillers into
their practices. It is crucial to appreciate
the  fact  that  the  products  once  pro-
claimed innovative have either stood the
test of time, with manufacturers reaping
the  rewards,  or  they  have  been  super-
seded. This section provides an overview
of  the  up  and  coming  soft  tissue  aug-
mentation devices.

EVOLENCE
Overview Evolence  (Colbar  LifeScience
Ltd.,  Herzliya,  Israel)  is  cross-linked
porcine-derived  collagen  (30  mg/mL
concentration).  Because  of  the  greater

biologic  similarity  between  pig  and
human  skin  versus  bovine  and  human
skin,  this  filler  has  potentially  lower
immunogenicity  than  bovine  collagen
fillers, with no preprocedure sensitivity
testing  required.65 It  is  currently  only
approved  in  Europe  and  Israel  as  two
products,  Evolence  and  Evolence
Breeze  (finer  version),  for  soft  tissue
augmentation.

Evolence is injected through a 25- to
27-gauge  1.25-  to  1.5-inch  needle  into
mid-depth dermal space using tunneling
and  cross-hatching  techniques,  while
Evolence  Breeze  is  injected  in  0.1-mL
aliquots  via  a  31-gauge  needle  using  a
serial puncture technique into the super-
ficial  dermis;  overcorrection  is  to  be
avoided.66 Postimplantation  massage  is
advised to enhance molding.

Beneﬁts Without  prior  allergy  testing
needed, these products can be injected
on  the  first  visit.  Special  cross-linking
technology,  Glymatrix,  yields  a  more
stable  collagen  product  that  creates
immediate  effects  potentially  lasting
for up to 1 year. Evolence products may
be  used  in  combination  with  other
agents such as HA fillers. This collagen
filler  is  stored  at  room  temperature.  A
recent  study  comparing  the  safety  and
efficacy  of  Evolence  and  Restylane
showed that Evolence performed simi-
larly to Restylane.67

Drawbacks  Evolence  does  not  contain
lidocaine as other collagen fillers do. It is
more  difficult  to  inject  than  Restylane
and  Juvéderm.  Needle  jamming  has
been noted on occasion, which makes
injections  a  bit  awkward.60 Religious
beliefs  have  to  be  considered  prior  to
implantation because this product con-
tains  porcine  collagen,  which  may  be
rejected on religious grounds by Jewish
and Muslim patients. This product had
not  yet  been  approved  by  the  FDA  at
the time of publication, but approval is
expected  shortly.  Although  postproce-
dure  side  effects  of  porcine  collagen
fillers  are  comparable  to  HA  fillers
(e.g., transient edema, erythema, pain,
ecchymoses),  the  development  of
infrequent lumps and nodules that last
several  months  has  also  been  noted.60
These  papules  can  be  treated  with
massage  and  intralesional  corticos-
teroids.  Because  of  these  side  effects,
injecting  Evolence  into  thin  skin  areas
should be avoided.60 This filler is new
and does not have the years of experi-
ence  associated  with  other  collagen
and  HA  fillers.  Its  use  should  be
approached with caution.

ISOLAGEN
Overview Although  presently  approved
in the UK, Isolagen (Isolagen Inc., Exton,
PA) is undergoing clinical studies in the
US  to  obtain  FDA  approval.  Utilizing
the  patient’s  skin,  fibroblasts  are  cul-
tured  and  stimulated 
to  generate
injectable material for aesthetic augmen-
tation.  The  appeal  of  Isolagen  is  that  it
uses  a  minimally  invasive  harvesting
technique,  employing  very  little  tissue 
(a 3-mm skin punch biopsy from a non-
cosmetic area), to produce an individual,
immunologically  inert  supply  of  vol-
ume-enhancing  product.68 About  2
months  after  harvesting,  a  1  to  2  cm3
amount  of  product  is  created  and
injected  at  about  2-week  intervals  in
several sessions to provide longer-lasting
results.  This  product  may  contain
fibroblasts  that  could  confer  long-term
benefits not found with other fillers.

Beneﬁts The crucial benefits of Isolagen
are  biocompatibility  and  safety.  This
product  contains  the  donor’s  own
fibroblasts, which may provide amelio-
rative  effects  by  increasing  the  produc-
tion  of  desired  cytokines  and  growth
factors, stimulating collagen and elastin
production.  Correction  is  believed,  but
not proven, to last about 6 to 12 months.
As other collagen fillers, it is injected at
superficial  and  moderate  dermal  depth
to treat rhytides and nasolabial folds as
well as the lips.

Drawbacks This  product  is  particularly
expensive  because  of  the  specific  engi-
neering  technique  of  cultured  autolo-
gous fibroblasts and collagen. There is a
waiting  period  of  2  months  and  the
product derived from the biopsy is rela-
tively sparse. However, this product can
be used in conjunction with other fillers
to  make  up  the  volume  difference.
Special  product  shipping,  handling  and
storage, as well as a narrow time-frame
of implantation (within 24 h of Isolagen
delivery) are limitations. The side effects
of  the  product  have  not  been  clarified,
but  are  likely  similar  to  other  fillers  on
the market.

LARESSE
Overview Laresse is a novel dermal filler
composed of two polymers in solution,
carboxymethyl  cellulose  (CMC)  and
polyethylene  oxide  (PEO),  both  of
which are hydrophilic. The product is a
viscoelastic  gel  that  is  injected  into  the
dermis  as  a  space-filling  substance.
Although the clinical data are limited, it
has been available in the UK since mid-
2006  and  has  become  a  competitor  to

cross-linked HA products. Since Laresse
is  not  cross-linked,  it  is  smoother  to
inject than HA fillers and imparts a soft
contour to the dermis.

Benefits Skin  testing  is  not  required
with  this  product.  The  components
have  been  used  in  numerous  injectable
therapeutics  and  medical  devices  and
are known to be immunologically inert.
Laresse is easily injected and is reported
to  produce  less  pain  on  injection  than
other fillers. The product is particularly
smooth  and  natural  feeling  in  the  skin
and it has been used in nasolabial folds
and  other  superficial  wrinkles.  Because
of its ability to stabilize and compact in
higher  concentrations  without  a  need
for cross-linking, it is hypothesized that
Laresse will have longer durability than
HA  fillers.69 However,  no  studies  have
been  published  in  the  US  to  support
these claims.

Drawbacks  Although 
studies  have
shown  that  Laresse  lasts  6  months  in
some  patients,  limited  clinical  studies
have been performed so its duration will
become evident as it becomes available
in  the  marketplace.  The  extent  of  its
potential applications in facial augmen-
tation is unclear as the product has been
used  clinically  only  since  2007  and  its
use  in  the  hands  of  practitioners  is  still
being  evaluated.  Laresse  does  not  con-
tain  lidocaine  and,  therefore,  preproce-
dure  anesthesia  is  usually  topical  or  a
nerve  block,  similar  to  HA  fillers.  Side
effects  are  analogous  to  the  HA  fillers
and consist mainly of transient swelling,
bruising,  and  redness.  Other  adverse
events are yet to be revealed as Laresse
is being investigated by the FDA.

AQUAMID
Overview  A  novel  permanent  filler,
Aquamid  (Ferrosan  A/S-Contura  Inter-
national  SA,  Cophenhagen,  Denmark)
has been approved and used in Europe,
South America, and the Middle East for
the  past  few  years.33 Aquamid  is  com-
posed of 97.5% pyrogenic water linked
to  2.5%  cross-linked  polyacrylamide
polymer. When it is introduced into skin
tissue,  acrylamide  stimulates  fibrotic
and  localized  foreign-body  reactions.
The  gel  is  packaged  in  a  1-mL  syringe
and  stored  at  room  temperature.  It  is
injected  through  a  27-gauge  needle
using  a  threading  technique  without
overcorrection.

Beneﬁts The material is inert, obviating
prior sensitivity testing. Aquamid is bio-
compatible  and  nonabsorbable,  which

yields  an  inert  and  durable  device  that
can 
last  indefinitely.  Aquamid  has
shown efficacy in lip augmentation, cor-
rection  of  nasolabial  folds,  depressed
mouth commissures, as well as glabellar
and perioral rhytides.33

Drawbacks Lacking  lidocaine  content,
Aquamid  requires  local  or  regional
anesthesia  prior  to  the  procedure.

Although  postimplantation  side  effects
are  similar  to  those  of  HA  fillers  (e.g.,
temporary  erythema,  edema,  redness),
rare long-term and more severe adverse
effects  are  more  prominent  with
Aquamid. The primary author has seen
several  patients 
in  South
America  with  prolonged  swelling  and
edema (Fig. 23-13). The exact duration
of Aquamid in the skin is still unclear,

with  most  recent  studies  demonstrat-
ing  about  2-year  durability.70 Rare
hematomas,  lumps,  granulomas,  and
indurations  do  occur  with  the  use  of
Aquamid.33 Use  of  this  filler  should  be
discouraged  until  more  safety  data  are
gathered.

HOW TO SELECT A FILLER

There are many filler options available,
so deciding on which filler to use is dif-
ficult. The A, B, C, D approach can help
(Table  23-6).  “A”  stands  for  assess the
patient. Determine which areas can be
treated  with  the  greatest  potential  for
improvement.  Look  at  the  entire  face
and decide where to get the “best bang
for  the  buck.”  For  example,  if  the
patient has prominent nasolabial folds,
there are two main options: treating the
nasolabial  folds,  or  treating  the  cheek
or  cheekbone  area  to  add  volume  that
will  improve  the  fold  by  pulling  the
skin  back.  A  patient  with  large  round
cheeks  would  do  better  to  have  the
nasolabial  fold  treated  (Fig.  23-14),
while  a  patient  with  thin  cheeks  and
facial volume loss would have a better
result  if  the  cheeks  were  treated  (Figs.
23-15 and 23-16). As a practitioner, it is
important  to  form  your  own  impres-
sion  first  before  the  patient  tells  you
their thoughts. In some cases you may
notice factors that the patient does not
even realize are contributing to an aged
appearance  (Figs.  23-17 and 23-18).
These  observational  skills  are  devel-
oped  with  experience.  Table  23-7 pro-
vides  an  overview  of  which  fillers  are
best  suited  for  each  facial  area.  Once
you have an idea of what areas would
make  the  most  significant  impact  if
treated,  then  move  to  the  “B”  section,
which  is  budget.  It  is  crucial  to  deter-
mine  how  much  money  the  patient  is
willing to spend. It is often the case that
the budget is lower than what is neces-
sary,  so  the  physician  must  determine
what areas to treat to achieve the best
cosmetic  effect  possible  within  the
patient’s budget. In addition, the practi-
tioner must consider the patient’s time
budget  or  schedule.  For  example,  if  a
patient is visiting from another country
and  planning  to  leave  the  following
day,  a  course  of  Sculptra  injections  is
not an option. Once the time and finan-
cial  budget  have  been  determined,  the
practitioner  should  talk  to  the  patient
about  other  considerations.  The  most
important  question  is  what  bothers
them about their face. It is often differ-
ent  than  what  the  physician  sees.

didate for a ﬁller such as Sculptra, Juvéderm Ultra, or Restylane to the cheek area below the cheekbones.

(cid:2) FIGURE 23-16 This patient appears to have buccal fat pad wasting, but actually is missing a tooth on
this side, leading to the defect. A dental consult is more appropriate for this patient rather than a dermal ﬁller.

Patient  happiness  is  contingent  on
improving  what  they  see  as  the  prob-
lems on their face, not what bothers the
physician.  The  following  or  similar
questions may be appropriate to frame
such a discussion, then, in the attempt
to identify the most suitable filler for a
patient:  What  have  you  tried  before?
Were  you  satisfied  with  the  results?
Why  or  why  not? What  concerns  do
you have? Are you a frequent bruiser?
Are you worried that your lips will look
too big? Do you hate it when your lip-
stick bleeds up into the lines on the top
lip? Do  you  have  any  religious  restric-
tions? Do you have any events coming
up? What  amount  of  downtime  can
you  tolerate? These  are  all  critical
issues  in  determining  the  most  appro-
priate  filler.  Once  all  this  information
has been gathered, the physician must
choose a filling device that meets all the
criteria.  It  is  a  relatively  easy  choice
after the preceding questions have been
answered.  In  addition,  the  physician
should  have  many  filler  choices  on
hand to give the patient the best result.

Injection Technique

Injection  technique  varies  from  filler  to
filler.  Most  physicians  use  either  an
anterograde,  retrograde,  or  serial  punc-
ture  technique.  Most  collagen  and  HA
fillers  are  injected  at  a  45-degree  angle
(Fig. 23-19). It is important to be individ-
ually trained on the injection techniques
of each filler. Fillers can be used in com-
bination  with  botulinum  toxins  and
other  cosmetic  procedures  (Fig.  23-20).
Although this chapter focused on facial
use,  fillers  can  also  be  injected  in  other
areas  of  the  body  such  as  the  hands 
(Fig.  23-21).  Many  injection  techniques
can  be  used.  However,  it  is  difficult  to
teach various techniques without video
and  live  demonstrations.  In  the  future,
instructional  videos  will  be  available  at
www.derm.net and training courses will
be offered at the University of Miami. In
addition,  the  American  Academy  of
Dermatology and the American Society
of Dermatologic Surgeons offer training
courses for dermatologists.

SUMMARY

Filling  agents  for  soft  issue  augmenta-
tion  procedures  are  now  widely  avail-
able,  based  on  the  long-standing  suc-
cessful  track  records  of  the  earliest
products. Most agents in the soft tissue
augmentation  armamentarium  can  be
safely used alone or in combination. The

 
 
 
most  frequently  used  agents  are  those
that contain HA. Given the widespread
popularity  of  soft  tissue  augmentation
and  the  ever-present  need  to  develop
safer fillers that last longer than the cur-
rent  products,  new  fillers  frequently
enter the market. Soon to be made avail-
able  in  the  US  is  an  HA  filler  that  con-
tains  lidocaine  as  well  as  more  durable
and safer synthetic agents. In short, the
demand  for  soft  tissue  augmentation
procedures  has  steadily  increased  since
their  inception  and  research  is  ongoing
to  develop  products  that  address  the
shortcomings  of  the  earlier  products
while  incorporating  and  expanding  on
their  advantages.  Moreover,  the  “cou-
pling”  of  fillers  with  other  cosmetic
interventions  (e.g.,  Botox  injections)
enhances  their  longevity  and  efficacy,
and  creates  an  overall  realistically  aes-
thetic  appearance.71 To  keep  astride
with the rapidly changing cosmetic der-
matology  arena,  it  behooves  the  aes-
thetic  practitioner  to  be  aware  of  the
current  availability,  application,  and
future potential of dermal fillers.

Lasers and Light
Devices

Joely Kaufman, MD

Since  1960,  when  the  first  laser  was
invented by T.H. Maiman at the Hughes
Research  Laboratory,  the  research  arm
of  the  Hughes  Aircraft  Company  in
Malibu, CA, research into and develop-
ment  of  lasers  has  blossomed  into  a
multibillion dollar industry. People have
been  especially  fascinated  by  the  capa-
bilities  and  possibilities  of  “laser  light.”
Beginning  with  the  ruby  laser,  these
instruments  have  quickly  become  an
integral  part  of  many  medical  special-
ties,  including  dermatology.  Lasers  and
light  devices  are  now  used  in  almost
every  area  of  medicine  and  our  daily
lives,  including  DVD  and  CD  players,
grocery  store  scanners,  holograms,  and
even traffic lights.

LASER BASICS

laser 

terminology 

To realize their usefulness in medicine
and aesthetic medicine in particular, it
is  important  to  understand  the  basics
(Box  24-1).
of 
Understanding  the  interactions  of  light
with  the  skin  helps  make  clinical  treat-
ments more successful. The word “laser”
is actually an acronym for light amplifi-
cation  by  stimulated  emission  of  radia-
tion. A laser amplifies light by stimulat-
ing photons, storing them, and releasing
them  as  a  beam  of  light.  In  order  to
accomplish  this,  the  laser  must  have  a
source  of  energy  referred  to  as  the
“pump.”  This  energy  gets  absorbed  by
atoms in the form of photons. When the
atom  emits  its  photons,  it  releases  its
energy  in  the  form  of  light.  All  of  this
occurs  in  the  lasing  medium.  Many
lasers  are  named  based  on  the  type  of
lasing medium that they contain. Lasing

BOX 24-1 A device is not deemed a true
laser unless it fulﬁlls three criteria:

Monochromicity: the device emits light of a

single wavelength.

Collimation: all waves travel in a single 

direction.

Coherence: all waves are in phase with each

212

other.

BOX 24-2 The three main chromophores
in the skin include:
Water
Hemoglobin
Melanin

mediums  can  be  liquid  (dyes  such  as
rhodamine),  solid  [e.g.,  ruby,  alexan-
drite,  Nd:YAG,  diode  (semiconductor)],
or gas (e.g., helium-neon, argon, CO2).

Several of the instruments in the cos-
metic  armamentarium  that  will  be  dis-
cussed  here  are  not  “true”  lasers.  This
fact does not render them any less useful
in  treating  patients,  but  it  is  an  impor-
tant  distinction  to  make.  The  impor-
tance lies in the nature of the interaction
between 
light  and  skin.  In  1983,
Anderson and Parish introduced the the-
ory of selective photothermolysis.1 This
theory  states  that  the  selectivity  of  a
laser for its target relies on the fact that
different  wavelengths  of  light  will  be
absorbed  by  different  chromophores  in
the  skin  (Box  24-2). This  allows  us  to
“selectively” destroy these targets with-
out damaging the surrounding tissues. In
order  to  accomplish  this,  the  pulse
width should be sufficiently long to heat
the tissue to the level of destruction, but
not long enough for that heat to transfer
out of the target to the surrounding nor-
mal skin. The duration of active lasing is
termed the “pulse width” or “pulse dura-
tion.” The ideal pulse duration for selec-
tive destruction of a target is determined
by  the  size  of  the  target.  The  time  it
takes  for  the  target  to  dissipate  two-
thirds of its heat to the surrounding tis-
sue  is  directly  proportional  to  its  size.
This  is  termed  the  thermal  relaxation
time  (Trt).  The  pulse  width  should  be
equal to or shorter than this Trt in order
to selectively destroy the target and not
the  normal  surrounding  tissue.  If  the
laser  pulse  is  longer  than  the  Trt,  then

there is more risk of unwanted damage
to other tissues. Lasers can emit light in
a  continuous  fashion,  or  in  spurts,  or
pulses.  The  theory  of  selective  pho-
tothermolysis  really  only  applies  to
pulsed laser systems, as continuous las-
ing results in bulk heating of tissue, and
hence little “selectivity.”

When  light  of  any  wavelength  or
intensity  hits  the  skin  four  possible
results  ensue.  The  light  can  be  directly
reflected from the skin. This usually takes
place at the stratum corneum, and this is
the  reason  that  practitioners  wear  pro-
tective  eyewear  even  when  not  lasing
near  the  eye.  Light  that  passes  through
the stratum corneum can be scattered by
collagen in the dermis or transmitted through
the dermis to the subcutaneous tissues. The
light  that  results  in  actual  work  being
done  on  the  tissues  is  the  light  that  is
absorbed.  Absorption  in  the  skin  is  by
three main chromophores.

Each  of  these  target  chromophores
absorbs  light  at  a  different  wavelength
(Fig. 24-1). Using these absorption spec-
tra,  we  can  select  a  laser  with  a  wave-
length that will be absorbed by the chro-
mophore.  This  allows  us  to  treat  the
target  and  not  the  normal  skin.  When
the  target  tissue  is  beneath  the  epider-
mis,  treatment  of  the  target  without
damage  to  the  epidermis  is  difficult  to
achieve  without  protection  of  the  epi-
dermis.  This  protection  is  achieved  via
cooling  systems.  Cooling  systems  are
critical

needed  to  produce  damage  to  the  folli-
cle.  Applying  this  much  energy  to  the
skin  without  cooling  the  epidermis
would  result  in  catastrophic  epidermal
damage.  Even  with  cooling,  in  some
instances epidermal protection may still
be  unattainable,  as  is  sometimes  the
case with darker skin types.

The  energy  of  lasers  is  expressed  in
joules.  Fluence  is  the  energy  per  area,
expressed in joules per centimeter squared
(J/cm2). The power of a laser is expressed
in  watts.  When  using  lasers  in  clinical
applications, it is important to remember
all  aspects  of  the  laser,  including  wave-
length, pulse duration, fluence, and cool-
ing. Lasers are just machines; it is up to the
operator to adjust and use them correctly.
In the next sections, the use of lasers
by  clinical  diagnosis  will  be  reviewed.
Several lasers can be used for each type
of  lesion,  some  more  effectively  than
others.  The  most  effective  lasers  for
each condition will be discussed.

VASCULAR LASERS

There are many different vascular lesions
that  can  be  treated  with  lasers.  Treating
vascular  lesions  with  the  laser  became
popular with the advent of the argon laser
in the 1970s. Since that time several laser
systems  targeting  vascular  lesions  have
been  developed.  The  chromophore  for
vascular  lesions  is  oxyhemoglobin.  The
peak  absorption  by  oxyhemoglobin  lies
somewhere between 500 and 600 nm. It
is  for  this  reason  that  most  of  the  lasers
used  for  vascular  lesions  emit  light  with
wavelengths  within  this  range.  Because
longer  wavelengths  penetrate  deeper
owing  to  less  scattering  by  collagen,
wavelengths outside of this range are also
used for deeper vascular lesions. Lesions
amenable to laser treatment with a vascu-
lar  wavelength  include  hemangiomas,
nevus flammeus (port wine stains), lym-
phangiomas,  venous  lakes,  angiomas,
telangiectasias,  spider  veins,  poikilo-
derma  of  Civatte,  scars,  and  erythema
from  rosacea.  Additional  reports  have
emerged  of  successful  treatment  with
vascular lasers for conditions such as ver-
ruca  vulgaris,  hypertropic  scars,  striae,
sebaceous  gland  hyperplasia,  granuloma
faciale, and  lupus erythematosus.

Because of the location of the vessel in
the dermis, the need for epidermal cool-
ing with the treatment of vascular lesions
is  critical  when  using  wavelengths  that
are  also  within  the  melanin  absorption
spectrum. The longer wavelength vascu-
lar lasers can be operated with care with-
out  epidermal  cooling.  Selective  pho-

tothermolysis  plays  a  critical  role  in  the
treatment of vascular lesions. The oxyhe-
moglobin  target  must  absorb  the  light,
generating heat, and coagulating the ves-
sel,  all  without  damaging  the  surround-
ing tissue. The early vascular lasers were
associated  with  a  high  incidence  of
hypopigmentation and scarring. The real-
ization  of  the  importance  of  photother-
molysis  and  pulse  widths  ultimately
allowed  for  the  safe  and  effective  treat-
ment of vascular lesions without scarring.
The pulsed dye laser (PDL) was intro-
duced  in  1989  and  remains  the  gold
standard  in  laser  treatment  for  heman-
giomas.  The  original  pulsed  dye  oper-
ated  at  a  wavelength  of  577  nm.
Subsequent  generations  of  PDLs  have
slightly 
longer  wavelengths,  corre-
sponding to deeper penetration. Longer-
wavelength  lasers,  however,  operate
further  outside  the  peak  absorption  of

oxyhemoglobin,  and  therefore  require
more  fluence  for  comparable  results.
PDLs  come  equipped  with  dynamic
cooling systems in the form of a cryogen
burst. Today, the most popular systems
used  for  vascular  lesions  are  the  PDL
(585  nm),  long-pulsed  dye  laser  (595
nm),  the  potassium  titanyl  phosphate
(532 nm), and the 1064 nm neodymium-
doped  yttrium 
aluminum  garnet
(Nd:YAG).  There  are  also  a  few  diode
systems that are very effective for vascu-
lar  lesions,  including  a  940  nm  diode
that  functions  very  well  for  telangiec-
tasias  on  the  face,  spider  veins  on  the
body, and angiomas (Table 24-1).

PDL  devices  are  effective  for  telang-
iectasias on the face, neck, and chest, but
perform 
the  body 
less  well  on 
(Fig.  24-2). This  is  related  to  the  short
wavelength  and  superficial  penetration
of  the  laser.  PDLs  are  also  used  for

vascular  malformations  in  adults  and
children,  including  hemangiomas,  port
wine  stains,  and  lymphangiomas.  The
PDLs  available  today  come  equipped
with cryogen cooling, various spot sizes,
and  adjustable  pulse  durations.  The
desired  pulse  duration  should  be
adjusted  to  the  vessel  diameter  and  its
thermal  relaxation  time.  The  larger  the
vessel  diameter,  the  longer  the  optimal
pulse width should be. Very short pulse
widths lead to rupture of the vessel and
resultant  purpura.  This  common  side
effect  made  the  PDLs  very  unpopular
with  cosmetic  patients  in  the  past.  The
recent  use  of  longer  pulse  widths  and
double passes with these lasers results in
comparable  efficacy  for  telangiectasias,
with  little  purpura.  Still,  with  the  treat-
ment  of  hemangiomas  and  port  wine
stains, purpuric settings are often needed
for adequate clearing of the lesion. Side
effects  in  addition  to  purpura  include
blistering,  postinflammatory  pigment
alteration  (PIPA)  caused  by  the  cryogen
spray,  as  well  as  scarring  from  overly
aggressive fluences. Lesions on the chest
and neck should always be treated with
lower energies than those on the face.

The potassiumtitanylphosphate (KTP)
laser,  with  a  wavelength  of  532  nm,  is
also highly absorbed by oxyhemoglobin.
It has proven to be at least as effective for
facial  telangiectasias  as  the  PDLs.2 The
KTP laser can operate in a range of longer
pulse widths, resulting in no purpura. Its
shortcomings  are  related  to  its  short
wavelength  and  lack  of  penetration.
Treatment  with  the  KTP  is  most  effec-
tive for very superficial vessels. In addi-
tion, treatment of tanned or darker skin
types should be performed with caution
if at all, as the 532 nm wavelength is well
absorbed by melanin.

Longer-wavelength  lasers  can  also  be
used effectively for vascular lesions. The
longer wavelengths allow for deeper pen-
etration  and  hence  are  excellent  choices
for  the  lower  extremities.  In  addition,
they are particularly useful for high flow
vessels  on  the  face.  Examples  of  lasers
used for spider veins include the 940-nm
diode laser and the 1064-nm Nd:YAG.

LASERS FOR PIGMENTED 
LESIONS

The first laser invented was also the first
to be used for removal of pigment. The
ruby  laser  emits  a  wavelength  that  is
very  well  absorbed  by  melanin.  This
superior  absorption  by  melanin  has
been  the  source  of  both  the  ruby’s  rise
and fall. The ruby is excellent at remov-

in 

Melanosomes  are  very  small,  and
hence  have  a  very  short  thermal  relax-
ation time, around 1 millisecond. In order
to  selectively  target  melanin,  without
harming  the  surrounding  tissue,  pulse
durations  equal  to  or  shorter  than  the
thermal  relaxation  time  of  melanin  are
used. Q-switched lasers are devices out-
fitted  with  a  mechanism,  a  Q-switch,
that  stores  the  generated  energy  and
releases  it  as  very  short,  intense  pulses.
The pulse width on a Q-switched laser is
in the nanosecond range. This extremely
short  pulse  duration  makes  Q-switched
lasers  ideal  for  selective  destruction  of
melanin. The most common Q-switched
lasers  used  today  are  the  Q-switched
ruby  (694  nm),  Q-switched  alexandrite
(755  nm),  Q-switched  Nd:YAG  (1064
nm), and the frequency-doubled Nd:YAG
(532  nm).  Choosing  which  Q-switched
laser to use largely depends on the color
and  depth  of  the  lesion  to  be  treated.

removal of nevi of Ito and Ota, lentigines,
as well as café-au-lait macules (Fig. 24-3).
When using any laser with a wavelength
that is absorbed by melanin, it is impor-
tant to remember that the laser does not
distinguish  between  normal  melanin  in
the  skin  and  abnormal  unwanted
melanin. The most common and signifi-
cant complication with these lasers is pig-
ment alterations. Hypopigmentation can
occur  from  the  laser  ablating  normal
melanin. PIPA can occur as a direct result
of the inflammation caused by high-peak
energies attained with Q-switching. Both
of these complications are more common
in darker skin types.

LASERS FOR TATTOOS

The prevalence of tattoos has increased
dramatically over the past several years.
With  continued  improvement  in  colors,
including  fluorescent  and  glowing  inks,
this  trend  should  be  expected  to  con-
tinue. The more tattoos placed, the more
that will need to be removed. In the past,
laser  tattoo  removal  involved  the  non-
specific ablation of the skin overlying the
tattoo, resulting in removal, but also pig-
ment  alterations,  and  even  scarring.
Nonselective  removal  devices/proce-
dures  include  the  CO2 laser,  the  argon
laser,  and  dermabrasion.  Currently,  tat-
too  removal  is  performed  primarily  via
selective  photothermolysis,  using  the
tattoo ink as the target chromophore for
the laser. Each color of ink is absorbed by
a  different  wavelength  of  light,  and
hence the more ink colors in the tattoo,
the  more  difficult  it  is  to  remove.  With

 
 
 
the recent introduction of new inks and
new colors, complete removal of modern
tattoos is becoming more and more diffi-
cult. Cosmetic tattoos are usually a blend
of several different inks, rendering them
extremely  challenging  to  remove  with
laser. Professional tattoos typically place
ink in the mid-dermis, requiring a device
that can penetrate to this depth in order
to achieve adequate treatment. Amateur
tattoos  typically  use  less  ink  and  place-
ment  is  more  superficial,  making  them
easier to remove.

Just  as  in  removal  of  melanosomes
from the skin, removal of tattoo ink must
be achieved with a very short pulse-width
system,  in  the  nanosecond  range.  These
systems are the Q-switched laser devices,
of  which  three  are  currently  available
on  the  market:  the  Q-switched  ruby,
the  Q-switched  alexandrite,  and  the 
Q-switched  Nd:YAG.  The  ruby  was  the
first Q-switched system available, and at
a  wavelength  of  694  nm,  it  is  good  for
removing blue and black pigments.3 The
alexandrite (755 nm) is also very effective
at  removing  blue  and  black  tattoo
pigments.4 In addition, it has the unique
ability to remove green, which is histori-
cally  one  of  the  most  difficult  colors  to
eliminate.  The  alexandrite  is  the  gold
standard for removal of green tattoos, in
fact,  as  the  other  two  Q-switched  lasers
tend to perform inadequately in this area.5
The Nd:YAG (1064 nm) is the work-
horse  for  professional  tattoo  removal
because of its capacity for deep penetra-
tion.  It  is  used  for  the  basic  black  ink
seen  in  both  amateur  and  professional
tattoos. The frequency-doubled Nd:YAG
(532 nm) can be used for red pigments.
Generally  a  combination  of  these  lasers
is needed for successful removal of a tat-
too. Even then, residual ink or a shadow
of the tattoo may persist despite numer-
ous treatment sessions.

The  most  important  aspect  of  tattoo
removal  is  setting  realistic  expectations
for the patient from the beginning. Laser
tattoo removal is not an eraser, as many
tattoos  will  not  be  completely  removed
no matter how many treatments are per-
formed. In addition, there are reports of
some  tattoo  inks  actually  darkening
because of  oxidation of the tattoo parti-
cles.  This  may  result  in  an  ink  that  is
unremovable.  Test  spots  are  important
especially  in  cosmetic  tattoos.  For  the
removal of professional tattoos, six to ten
treatments, spaced at least 6 weeks apart,
may  be  required.  For  amateur  tattoos,
three  to  five  treatments  are  generally
effective.6 In  patients  with  darker  skin
types, tattoo removal may result in scar-
ring  or  dyspigmentation.  Many  authors

advocate  the  use  of  topical  bleaching
agents  prior  to  sunscreen  to  reduce
the competing  chromophores 
(skin
melanosomes). With every patient, regu-
lar use of sunscreen in the treatment area
is essential. Any patient with a tan in the
area of treatment should not be treated.

Wound healing and postoperative care
are  also  essential  parts  of  laser  tattoo
removal. Moist wound healing via topi-
cal  emollient  creams  and  a  dressing  are
recommended for all patients for 1 to 2
weeks  after  laser  treatment.  Straying
from  this  regimen  will  increase  the  risk
of  postinflammatory  changes  and  scar-
ring, and delay additional treatments.

The future of tattoo removal may be
represented by Q-switched devices that
emit picosecond pulses, which would be
even  shorter  than  the  currently  used
nanosecond  devices.  In  addition,  the
introduction of dissolvable inks or more
easily  removed  inks  may  improve  the
treatment of tattoos.

LASERS FOR EPILATION

Hair removal is one of the most popular
cosmetic procedures performed today. It
seems that every salon, spa, and medical
office offers this service to their patients,
all using different devices. Several meth-
ods  of  hair  removal  with  light  devices
have been explored. The most common
of  these  is  via  selective  photothermoly-
sis,  with  melanin  as  the  chromophore.
This  melanin  lies  in  the  hair  shaft  itself
and in the bulge region of the follicle. In
order  to  permanently  remove  hair,  one
must eradicate not only the hair itself but
the reproducing cells of the follicle. The

energy, in the form of heat, must travel
from the hair to the bulge area where the
reproducing  cells  reside  (1.5  mm  below
the  epidermis).  Although  the  Trt  of
melanin is very short, simply destroying
the  melanin  would  only  result  in  frag-
mentation  of  the  hair,  with  subsequent
regrowth. Use of the Q-switched Nd:YAG
(1064  nm)  results  in  fragmentation  of
the  hair,  and  temporary  hair  removal.
Although an appropriate laser was read-
ily  available,  it  was  not  until  Anderson
and Dierickx lengthened the pulse width
of the ruby that this device could be used
for  hair  removal.  Since  that  discovery,
many  other  systems  have  come  to  the
market,  rendering  the  ruby  essentially
obsolete for hair removal.

The  choice  of  which  laser  to  use 
for  epilation  should  be  based  on  two
overarching  factors:  (1)  the  hair  color
and  texture  and  (2)  the  patient’s  skin
color. Both of these factors must be con-
sidered  for  successful  and  semiperma-
nent  removal.  Darker  and  coarser  hair
absorbs more light energy from the laser
device,  and  hence  can  be  removed  at
even longer wavelengths, which are tra-
ditionally less absorbed by melanin. The
strongest absorption of light by melanin
is at the shorter wavelengths (Fig. 24-4).
Therefore,  light  or  fine  hairs  are  better
treated at these wavelengths. However,
melanin  in  the  skin  competes  with  the
melanin in the hair for laser absorption.
Hence  the  darker  the  skin  color,  the
more  difficultly  the  laser  has  in  distin-
guishing the hair melanin from the skin
melanin, and the more difficult the treat-
ment. Cooling is critical in hair removal
for protection of the epidermis. Without
cooling of the epidermis, the melanin in

the skin would first absorb the laser light
and burn the skin, as opposed to remov-
ing  the  hair.  Many  of  the  wavelengths
used  for  hair  removal  can  also  be  used
for  epidermal  pigment  removal  when
used  without  cooling.  Hair  without  or
with  very  little  pigment  (white  or
light blonde)  cannot  be  permanently
removed by any device available at the
time  of  this  writing.  Also,  as  discussed
previously,  the  shorter  wavelengths
penetrate  less  deeply;  therefore,  some
do  not  effectively  reach  the  hair  bulb.
The  ruby  laser  (694  nm)  is  no  longer
used  for  hair  removal  for  this  reason.
The  alexandrite  laser  (755  nm)  is  the
shortest  wavelength  hair  removal  sys-
tem  used.  Because  of  the  high  absorp-
tion  of  light  by  melanin  at  this  wave-
length, the alexandrite is able to remove
lightly pigmented hairs from light skin.
One drawback of using a laser with
a  wavelength  that  is  highly  absorbed
by  melanin  is  that  it  needs  to  be  used
with  extreme  caution  in  darker  skin
types.  Treatment  of  darker  skin  types
with  the  alexandrite  can  result  in
hypopigmentation  or  postinflamma-
tory hyperpigmentation.

The  alexandrite  laser  is  my  laser  of
choice for patients with Fitzpatrick skin
types I to III. It is also the best choice for
light or very fine hairs. There are reports
of it being used safely in types IV and V,
but  it  should  be  used  with  caution.
Reports  of  dyspigmentation  in  darker
skin  types  are  frequently  seen  with  the
alexandrite. In addition, use on recently
tanned  skin  can  also  result  in  pigment
abnormalities,  though  typically  tran-
sient. There are also reports of paradoxi-
cal hypertrichosis after laser hair removal
with the alexandrite.7 This is even more
common on darker skin types.

The diode is the workhorse of all the
hair removal systems, as it can be used
on  all  skin  types.  Optimal  results  are
achieved  with  coarse,  dark  hair.  There
are  two  wavelengths  of  diode  lasers  for
hair removal currently on the market, 800
nm and 810 nm. There is very little differ-
ence between the two wavelengths as far
as  clinical  results  are  concerned.  One
would  expect  deeper  penetration  of  the
light with the longer 810 nm, but slightly
less absorption by melanin would occur.
The Nd:YAG (1064 nm) systems oper-
ate  at  a  wavelength  that  is  minimally
absorbed by melanin. Consequently, this
laser is effective for removal primarily of
dark,  coarse  hairs.  The  introduction  of
this laser made laser hair removal avail-
able to darker-skinned patients.

Comparisons of laser systems for hair
removal  have  considered  the  clinical

efficacy  of  the  alexandrite,  diode,  and
Nd:YAG. The alexandrite and the diode
are comparable in efficacy and pain tol-
erability.  The  Nd:YAG  was  rated  more
painful  and  less  efficacious  in  one
study.8 This laser, however, is the safest
system  in  dark-skinned  patients  with
dark  hair,  because  of  the  longer  wave-
length and less absorption by melanin in
the  skin.  Other  studies  have  shown
comparable  efficacy  among  all  three
laser systems.9 See Table 24-2 for a list of
lasers used for hair removal.

Prior  to  full  treatment  each  patient
should  be  evaluated  by  a  physician
trained  in  laser  hair  removal  practices.
Skin  should  not  be  tanned,  damaged,  or
show  any  signs  of  infection.  In  many
cases, in darker-skinned patients, pretreat-
ment with bleaching agents is needed. For
adequate  removal,  hair  should  have  at
least  some  pigment,  as  melanin  is  the

chromophore for laser epilation. Patients
must understand that white, fine, or very
blonde hairs will not be removed by these
devices. Prior to full treatment, test spots
are  generally  performed.  Full  treatment
can be carried out 2 weeks after the test
spot, if there is a good response without
adverse  effects.  Immediately  after  treat-
ment,  the  area  should  exhibit  follicular
edema and erythema. This is the normal
response  to  laser  heating  of  the  follicle
(Fig. 24-5). Postprocedure application of a
class  5  or  6  topical  steroid  for  5  days  is
often  used  in  darker  skin  types  to  avoid
postinflammatory  changes.  Depending
on  the  hair,  the  treatment  area,  and  the
patient’s skin type, complete removal can
take anywhere from three to twelve ses-
sions.  These  should  be  spaced  1  month
apart, longer for the slower growing areas
such as the legs and back. Sun protection
is critical both before and after laser hair
removal.

Laser  hair  removal  is  an  effective
method  of  epilation  that  can  yield 
long-lasting  effects.  Choosing  the  right
system  for  each  patient  depending  on
skin  color,  hair  color,  and  hair  caliber  is
essential. Patient compliance with a regi-
men including sun protection is also a crit-
ical part of any successful laser procedure.

RESURFACING LASERS

Ablative  resurfacing  has  historically
been  performed  using  the  CO2 laser.
Since  its  introduction  in  1968,  the  CO2
laser has been used for the treatment of
acne scars, rhytides, actinic chelitis, and

tional resurfacing with Fraxel.

 
 
 
other  symptoms  of  photoaging.  At  a
wavelength  of  10,600  nm,  high  water
absorption  results  in  rapid  ablation  of
the epidermis. The erbium:YAG (Er:YAG)
emits  a  wavelength  of  2940  nm  and  is
even  more  highly  absorbed  by  water.
This intense absorption by water results
in  a  more  superficial  depth  with  the
Er:YAG when compared to the CO2 laser.
With the rapid vaporization of tissue with
any ablative laser comes tissue tightening
and smoothing of the skin, which is not
achieved  with  most  other  nonablative
laser systems. Of the ablative devices, the
tightening is most dramatic with the CO2
lasers.  However,  the  complication  rates,
and  the  downtime,  have  resulted  in  a
decrease  in  the  use  of  these  systems  for
rejuvenation.  Proper  patient  selection  is
critical, and even then, side effects can be
high, including permanent scarring. In the
hands  of  an  experienced  user,  the  CO2
still  remains  an  excellent  instrument  for
facial  rejuvenation  in  the  right  patient.
These  devices  are  currently  being  modi-
fied  into  fractional  ablative  devices  that
should  achieve  some  of  the  tightening
effects  seen  with  ablation,  yet  with  a
lower risk of side effects.10

Fractional Resurfacing

In 

The  search  for  laser  rejuvenation  alter-
natives was prompted by the high com-
plication  rates  associated  with  tradi-
tional  ablative  resurfacing.  Nonablative
lasers became popular for the treatment
of  rhytides  and  acne  scarring  as  they
were established as safe. These devices
did stand up to their safety profile, but
efficacy  was  questionable  in  many
cases. 
fact,  before  and  after
photographs  demonstrated  minimal
changes and these devices are used pri-
marily for acne treatment. Laser rejuve-
nation  in  a  manner  that  could  produce
good  clinical  results  with  a  high  safety
profile was the next step. The novel con-
cept of fractional resurfacing was intro-
duced in 2004 by Manstein et al.11 The
term  “fractional”  refers  to  treating  a
portion  or 
the  skin.
fraction  of 
Unfortunately,  the  definition  does  not
specify  laser  type,  spot  size  require-
ments,  or  wavelength;  it  just  describes
the manner of distribution of the treat-
ment  spots.  These  parameters  will  be
determined  in  the  future  with  more
research  in  this  area.  By  only  treating
microscopic  areas  in  one  session,  heal-
ing time is greatly reduced. Each treated
area is surrounded by normal viable skin
from  which  migration  of  keratinocytes
occurs,  increasing  the  time  to  healing.
Each treatment spot is termed a micro-

scopic  treatment  zone  (MTZ).  The
MTZs heal via migration of the normal
surrounding  epidermis,  as  opposed  to
healing  via  differentiation.  Because  of
this unusual manner of spot placement,
very  high  energies  can  be  tolerated
without bulk heating. Epidermal healing
with  a  true  microspot  fractional  device
has been shown to be complete within
36  hours.  This  rapid  healing  time
reduces the incidence of infections, pig-
ment alterations, and scarring.

Spot size is a critical part of fractional
resurfacing. Exactly how small the spot
size needs to be is still being debated at
this  time.  It  is  important  to  clarify  that
there  are  currently  many  different  lasers
that use the term fractional. Most of these
are merely lasers with a scanner that dis-
tributes  small  spots,  resulting  in  treat-
ment  of  a  portion  of  the  face.  It  is
unclear at this point how small the treat-
ment  spots  must  be  to  still  obey  the
concept  of  “fractional  resurfacing.”
Fractional  devices  have  energy  adjust-
ments  just  as  with  any  other  laser
system. In addition, they feature density
adjustments, which is also a critical part
of  treatment  efficacy.  The  higher  the
density,  the  closer  together  the  MTZs
will  be,  and  the  more  aggressive  the
treatment.  “Ablative”  results  can  be
obtained with very high energies at very
high densities with any device.

Fractional  devices  come  in  two  vari-
eties: ablative and nonablative. The first
fractional  nonablative  device,  Fraxel
(Reliant), was introduced in 2004. At the
time of publication there were three frac-
tional nonablative devices on the market.
The Fraxel laser is a 1550 nm nonablative
erbium-doped  fiber  laser.  The  fractional
handpiece  from  Palomar  is  a  1540  nm
wavelength  fiber  laser  powered  by  the
Palomar StarLux Intense Pulsed Light sys-
tem. The Affirm (Cynosure) system offers
a device with a wavelength of 1440 nm.
The  wavelength  for  these  lasers  lies
within  the  water  absorption  spectrum,
and  hence  water  is  the  chromophore.
These  lasers  are  termed  nonablative  as
they do not result in ablation, but rather
coagulation of the epidermis. MTZs can
be  placed  in  a  random  or  stamped  pat-
tern. Different devices use various meth-
ods of MTZ placement, and it is not clear
at  this  time  which  one  is  best.  The
untreated  skin  surrounding  each  MTZ
serves  as  a  reservoir  for  epidermal  cells,
which migrate to rapidly heal the treated
area. Higher energies translate to deeper
penetration by the laser. Penetration well
into the dermis results in better collagen
production. MTZ diameters also increase
as the energy is increased, so ideally each

device  should  have  density  adjustments
that  would  account  for  this  change.  To
avoid bulk heating, at very high energies,
the  density  of  the  treatment  should  be
reduced,  with  wider  spacing  of  the
MTZs.  These  devices  are  currently
approved  for  treatment  of  periorbital
rhytides,  acne  and  surgical  scars,  and
melasma. They have also been reported
to be effective for striae, photoaging, and
lentigines.  Fractional  nonablative  lasers
are  safe  for  use  off  the  face  as  well.
Studies  in  darker-skin  types  indicate
that  the  fractional  nonablative  lasers 
(1440  nm,  1540  nm,  and  1550  nm)  are
safe  to  use  in  all  skin  types  at  adjusted
energy and density settings.

The  fractional  ablative  devices  were
still in their infancy at the time of publi-
cation  (Table  24-3).  The  gold  standard
for  ablative  resurfacing  was  once  the
CO2 laser,  but  its  use  has  plunged
because of the high associated risks seen
with  full-face  resurfacings.  The  reintro-
duction  of  the  CO2 with  a  fractional
delivery  system  (Reliant)  is  sure  to
change  the  recent  conventional  thought
about  the  CO2 laser.  A  fractional  CO2
device  (ActiveFX,  Lumenis)  is  also  cur-
rently  available.  This  laser  uses  a  scan-
ning  delivery  of  millimeter  spots  at  an
ablative 10,600-nm wavelength. The frac-
tional CO2 is equipped with a millimeter
spot size with a new micron spot deliv-
ery just released. This random placement
of lesions results in better cooling of sur-
rounding tissues and less chance of bulk
tissue heating. Healing times average sev-
eral  days.  There  is  currently  a  fractional
ablative Er:YAG (2940 nm) device on the
market  that  is  powered  by  an  intense
pulsed  light  system  (IPL)  (Pixel,  Alma).
This laser delivers energy to the skin in a
small  spot  stamp  pattern.  Several  treat-
ments are recommended. With the high
absorption of light by water at this wave-
length,  penetration  is  approximately 
50 (cid:4)m per pass. A fractional yttrium scan-
dium gallium garnet (YSGG) (Cutera) at a
wavelength of 2790 nm was also recently
introduced.  With  a  wave-length  less

allow  for  deeper  penetration  with  con-
current  ablation  of  the  epidermis.
Though this wavelength is relatively new
to  the  aesthetic  market,  the  results  are
promising.

NONLASER SYSTEMS

Intense Pulsed Light

IPL  devices  are  light  instruments  that
look and act like lasers, but do not qual-
ify as true lasers because of their lack of
coherent,  monochromatic  light.  Newer
IPL systems are able to pump true laser
devices  in  a  separate  handpiece,  allow-
ing  for  the  purchase  of  one  system  for
many  indications.  This  has  made  these
systems  very  popular  since  their  intro-
duction in 1995. The first system intro-
duced,  the  Photoderm  (ESC/Sharplan,
now  Lumenis), was  touted  as  the  best
modality  for  treating  leg  veins.  It  was
only after early use of the system that its
true  capabilities  of  removing  lentigines
and  telangiectasias  were  recognized.11
There  are  many  IPLs  on  the  market
today, with new ones introduced every
year.  IPLs  have  been  used  in  several  of
the  above  conditions,  including  acne,
facial  telangiectasias,  photodamage,
lentigines,  poikiloderma,  nevus  flam-
meus,  venous  malformations,  spider
veins, keratosis pilaris, and hair removal.
IPL  devices  emit  noncoherent  light
with  wavelengths  between  500  and
1200  nm.  These  are  flashlamp-based
systems  that  contain  an  internal  filter
and  several  external  “cut-off  filters.”
These filters are used to block the emis-
sion  of  light  lower  than  the  desired
wavelengths.  Many  cutoff  filters  are
available for each system and generally
come  in  a  handpiece  that  can  be
changed  on  the  unit  body.  By  using
these filters, one can employ the theory
of selective photothermolysis with non-
coherent, polychromatic light.

IPL  devices  also  benefit  from  multiple
adjustable pulse durations. Depending on
the target and the patient’s skin type, pulse
widths  can  be  manipulated  accordingly.
For  treatment  of  targets  with  short  ther-
mal relaxation times, the pulse widths can
be  shortened.  For  larger  vessels  with
longer  Trts,  pulse  widths  can  be  length-
ened. This is important in the treatment of
telangiectasias, as when the vessels seem
to be resistant to treatment, simply chang-
ing the pulse width can result in an effec-
tive  clinical  response.  Sequential  pulsing,
which allows time for cooling in between
pulses, reduces the risk of bulk heating of

tissues;  therefore,  the  risk  of  scarring  is
also  decreased.  Sequential  pulsing  is  also
thought  to  aid  in  the  treatment  of  telan-
giectasias  by  generating  deoxygenated
hemoglobin with the first pulse, and using
this as the target for the second pulse.12

IPLs  have  also  been  favored  over
some of the lasers for treating telangiec-
tasias and dyspigmentations because of
the large spot sizes available with these
devices. This renders treatment of larger
areas  more  feasible.  Another  important
component  of  IPL  instruments  is  the
cooling  apparatus.  With  cooling  of  the
epidermis, complications such as blister-
ing  and  dyspigmentation  are  kept  to  a
minimum.  Most  IPL  devices  are  now
outfitted with a cooling device, whether
contact or cool air.

IPLs are one of the primary treatments
for  facial  telangiectasias, 
lentigines, 
poikiloderma,  and  photorejuvenation.
Several  IPLs  also  have  interchangeable
filter  handpieces  for  hair  removal,  non-
ablative  skin  tightening,  and  even  frac-
tional  resurfacing.  Preparation  of  a
patient for IPL involves determining skin
type  and  sun  protection.  Treating  a
patient  who  is  recently  tanned  may
result  in  hypopigmentation  caused  by
the  absorption  of  melanin  by  the  laser.
Patients  should  be  instructed  to  use
proper photoprotection both before and
after  treatments.  Special  care  should  be
taken when using these devices to treat
patients  with  darker  skin  types  (IV  and
V).13,14 Pulse widths and delays between
pulses should be lengthened when treat-
ing this population. A thin layer of cool
ultrasound gel is placed on the skin sur-
face  and  the  laser  is  placed  directly
against the gel. (Some of the newer sys-
tems do not require gel.) Care should be
taken to place pulses close together, and
far  spacing  can  result  in  striping  in

patients  with  severe  photodamage 
(Fig. 24-6). Striping can also occur in any
patient when higher fluences are used and
pulses  are  not  placed  closely  together.
This  complication  is  easily  remedied  by
further treatment of the untreated areas.
After the treatment, the areas are cleansed
of all gel, and sun protection is applied.
A  full-face  treatment  generally  takes
approximately  15  minutes.  No  topical
anesthesia is required for most types of
IPL  treatment.  With  high  fluences  used
for  port  wine  stains,  some  patients  may
require  topical  anesthesia.  Three  to  five
treatments  at  1-month  intervals  are  rec-
ommended  for  clearing  of  photodam-
age.15 More are generally needed for port
wine stains and other vascular malforma-
tions.  Downtime  is  minimal,  if  there  is
any at all, with mild darkening of treated
lentigines, and erythema of treated areas.
Patients  can  generally  return  to  work
immediately  following  the  procedure,
which  makes  IPLs  very  popular  with
patients. The ability to treat vascular and
pigmented  lesions  with  one  instrument,
as well as the rapid treatment times, and
consistent,  reproducible  results  achieved
when these device are used properly have
catapulted  the  IPL  systems  to  the  fore-
front of the industry (Fig. 24-7).

Light Emitting Diodes

Light  emitting  diodes  (LEDs)  have  gar-
nered  recent  attention  because  of  their
ease of use and popularity as activation
sources  for  aminolevulinic  acid  (i.e.,
photodynamic  therapy).  These  devices
emit  noncoherent  light  of  either  one 
primary wavelength or of a short range
of  wavelengths.  Unlike  the  previously
mentioned  instruments,  LEDs  do  not
operate  by  the  theory  of  selective
photothermolysis.  LEDs  operate  on  the

the methyl ester of ALA (mALA) (Metvix,
Galderma).  Commonly  used  activation
sources include LEDs (red and blue), pulsed
dye laser (585 nm, 595 nm), and IPL devices.
PDT  has  recently  been  used  to
enhance  the  effectiveness  of  commonly
used  photorejuvenation  procedures.
Split-face  studies  have  shown  that  the
addition of ALA to traditional IPL treat-
ments results in better clinical ameliora-
tion of the signs of photoaging than IPL
alone.22,24 One group even demonstrated
a greater increase in collagen production
on  the  PDT/IPL  side  when  compared
with IPL alone.25 The addition of ALA to
an  IPL  photorejuvenation  procedure  is
useful  in  patients  looking  for  treatment
of precancerous lesions in addition to the
aesthetic aspects of photodamage.

TIGHTENING DEVICES

The  newest  wave  in  light  devices  is
directed  at  the  problem  of  achieving
skin tightening.  Although  nonablative
fractional  resurfacing  has  been  quite 
it  has
successful  at  rejuvenation, 
proven insufficient in actual tightening.
Evaluation of the action of “tightening” is
difficult  in  itself,  as  there  is  no  standard-
ized,  quantitative  measure.  Photographic
assessments  are  generally  inadequate,  as
even a slight change in position will alter
the result. In addition, it is almost impossi-
ble  to  measure  the  slight  tightening  that
occurs,  especially  if  it  occurs  over  many
months. Nevertheless, many of the practi-
tioners who use these devices do believe
in their efficacy in a percentage of patients.
The  practice  of  tightening  the  skin  is
based on the notion that collagen will con-
tract  when  heat  is  applied.  Several  light-
based devices have been introduced with
the  goal  of  delivering  heat  to  the  dermis
while  leaving  the  epidermis  unharmed.
This heat presumably causes collagen con-
traction and hence lifting. The epidermis

theory of photobiomodulation, or photo-
modulation, which is the ability of light to
alter  cellular  activity.  This  capacity  to
change  the  cellular  metabolism  via  light
energy has been demonstrated in the lab-
oratory.16 It  is  an  essentially  nonthermal
manner of treating the skin, and has been
shown  to  be  effective  for  several  condi-
tions when used as low level laser therapy
(LLLT).17,18 LLLT  uses  small  spot  sizes,
rendering  full-face  treatments  difficult.
The advent of LED systems introduced a
method  by  which  large  areas  could  be
easily  and  painlessly  treated.  These  sys-
tems consist of panels of lights of a partic-
ular wavelength or range of wavelengths.
Currently  available  LEDs  include  blue,
yellow,  red,  near  infrared,  and  infrared.
LEDs are most commonly used for acne
and  photorejuvenation.  Case  reports  for
use  in  wound  healing,  psoriasis,  and
rhytides also appear in the literature. The
advantage of LEDs over other lasers is the
ease  of  treatment,  including  a  painless,
rapid, and safe manner of treating all skin
types. The disadvantage is that the clini-
cal results may not be as dramatic as some
of the other laser and light procedures.

In 2003, a visible red light device was
approved  by  the  FDA  for  skin  rejuvena-
tion  (Omnilux  Revive).  A  novel  yellow
LED has also been approved for photore-
juvenation in the US. These instruments
not only differ in the wavelength of light
emitted, but also in the mode of delivery.
Some systems pulse the light in sequences
and some have nonpulsed, constant deliv-
ery  systems.  Which  manner  is  the  most
effective has not yet been determined.

LEDs have been shown in vivo to alter
cell activity, including that of fibroblasts
and  immune  cells.  Takezaki  et  al.
reported  an  increase  in  vimentin  fila-
ments  and  mitochondria  in  the  fibro-
blasts from skin irradiated with a 633 nm
LED.19 In  vivo studies  have  demon-

strated  an  increase  in  collagen  produc-
tion postradiation with 633-nm LED.20

Several LEDs are currently available on
the market in a range of wavelengths and
pulse  sequencing.  To  date  no  one  has
demonstrated that one particular pulsing
sequence  is  superior  to  another.  Such
studies,  along  with  comparisons  of  the
different  wavelengths,  are  warranted  to
hone the use of these devices and perhaps
expand the range of indications. The need
for  additional  studies  notwithstanding,
the use of LEDs to activate aminolevulinic
acid  has  become  an  important  compo-
nent in photodynamic therapy.

PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY

The  notion  of  photodynamic  therapy
(PDT)  has  been  around  since  the  early
1900s, but it was not until Kennedy intro-
duced PDT that its true advantages could
be  discovered  in  dermatology.21 PDT
represents  the  use  of  a  photosensitizer
activated by light to selectively treat the
skin. The currently approved use for PDT
in the United States is for nonhyperkera-
totic  actinic  keratoses  of  the  face  using
5-aminolevulinic  acid  (ALA)  (Levulan®
Kerastick,  DUSA  Pharmaceuticals)  acti-
vated by blue light. However, several off-
label indications have received attention
in the literature and are now commonly
used  in  cosmetic  practice.  These  condi-
tions include photoaging22 and sebaceous
hyperplasia.23

5-ALA is a prodrug that is applied to tar-
get areas and selectively absorbed by prolif-
erating cells and pilosebaceous units. Then,
5-ALA is metabolized into protoporphyrin
IX (PpIX), which is innately photosensitiz-
ing.  PpIX  is  activated  by  several  different
wavelengths  of  light,  resulting  in  the  pro-
duction  of  free  radicals  and  selective
destruction  of  target  cells.  The  currently
approved drugs for PDT include 5-ALA and

remains protected as a result of dynamic
cooling  during  the  application  of  the
infrared  light.  One  of  the  most  popular
skin-tightening  instruments  is  the  Titan
(Cutera). The Titan emits a long pulse of
infrared  light  with  wavelengths  ranging
from 1200 to 1500 nm. The procedure is
completely  painless  with  resultant  mild
erythema that resolves in a few minutes
to hours. Collagen contraction is immedi-
ate, but in addition to this contraction col-
lagen  synthesis  is  also  induced.  Many
patients see results with these devices, yet
some  do  not  respond  to  the  treatment.
Patient selection, energies used, and over-
all skin quality may play a role in deter-
mining if a treatment will be successful.

Other  “tightening”  products  include
monopolar,  bipolar,  and  combination
unipolar  and  bipolar  radiofrequency
devices  (Table  24-4). The  theory  is  the
same,  in  that  nonselective  heat  is
applied to the dermis via direct contact
with  the  skin.  The  epidermis  must  be
protected  with  a  cooling  system.  The
radiofrequency devices tend to be some-
what  more  painful  than  the  infrared
devices.  Some  radiofrequency  instru-
ments  require  application  of  topical
anesthesia  prior  to  the  procedure.  Side
effects are limited and include erythema
(lasting up to 1 week), depressions, and
superficial burns. No cases of permanent
scarring have been reported.

The literature contains very few stud-
ies measuring the effectiveness of these
tightening  devices.  Most  reports  are
anecdotal  and  demonstrate  high  safety,
but  not  efficacy.  Clearances  for  these
devices  are  for  the  face  and  neck,  but
many are using them in areas such as the
arms, buttocks, and abdomen. Both the
infrared and radiofrequency systems can
be used in all skin types, as long as the
cooling systems are functional.

SUMMARY

220

Since  their  introduction  in  1960,  lasers
have  continued  to  expand  in  popularity

and availability. Laser science was changed
forever with the introduction of the the-
ory  of  selective  photothermolysis  by
Anderson and Parrish. Based on this the-
ory, our understanding of how lasers can
be used to treat numerous conditions has
flourished.  Paired  with  our  continued
understanding  of  wound  healing,  new
developments in the laser industry have
significantly increased the safety of these
procedures  while  managing  to  improve
efficacy. With each year comes the intro-
duction  of  newer  technologies  with  the
goal  of  developing  even  safer  and  more
effective devices for various dermatologic
conditions (Fig. 24-8). Of course, it is rec-
ommended that with any new device or
new user, start slow. Overaggressiveness
with  any  laser  or  light  device  can  cause
severe complications, sometimes perma-
nent.  Additional  research  in  this  area  is
ongoing and warranted, as are increased
regulations  in  laser  training  and  opera-
tion. This will ensure the safe and effec-
tive treatment of all laser patients.

Sclerotherapy

Larissa Zaulyanov-Scanlan, MD

In addition to the face, neck, chest, and
hands,  the  aesthetic  appearance  of  the
legs  is  a  significant  area  of  concern  to
patients. In 2005, according to statistics
gathered  by  the  American  Society  for
Aesthetic  Plastic  Surgery,  sclerotherapy
ranked as the sixth most common non-
surgical cosmetic procedure.1 In order to
maximize  the  successful  treatment  of
leg veins with sclerotherapy, a thorough
understanding  of  venous  pathology,
specifically  venous  hypertension  and
chronic  venous  insufficiency,  is  crucial
for practitioners.

The aim of this chapter is to familiar-
ize  the  reader  with  the  underlying
pathology,  the  diagnosis,  and  the  treat-
ment  of  venous  hypertension,  and  to
help the reader differentiate between the
medical  and  the  cosmetic  sclerotherapy
patient.  In  keeping  with  the  theme  of
this  textbook,  the  treatment  section  of
this  chapter  will  focus  on  sclerotherapy
as  it  pertains  to  the  cosmetic  patient,
specifically  regarding  the  treatment  of
leg  telangiectasias,  venulectasias,  and
reticular  veins.  Treatment  options  for
patients  with  clinically  relevant  venous
disease will be briefly mentioned.

THE VENOUS SYSTEM AND
VARICOSE VEINS

The venous system is a low-pressure sys-
tem  and  a  blood  reservoir.  Unlike  arter-
ies,  which  carry  oxygenated  blood  and
have  a  thick  elastic  muscular  lining
designed  to  withstand  high  pressures,
veins carry deoxygenated blood, are thin-
walled, and easily distend with increased
pressure. The map of venous circulation
is more variable than that of arterial cir-
culation, and anastomoses between veins
commonly  occur.  This  multiplicity
allows  for  surgical  repair  of  the  venous
system  as  there  are  several  routes  for
deoxygenated  blood  to  return  to  the
heart. Veins rely on the heart as well as
skeletal  muscle  contraction  for  circula-
tion. Contraction of skeletal muscle com-
presses the veins within them and helps
to propel blood back to the heart. This is
particularly  important  in  the  lower
extremities  where  the  force  of  gravity
must be overcome to maintain proper cir-

culation.  The  contractile  action  of  the
skeletal muscles, primarily the calf mus-
cles, helps to transport blood upward.

The Venous System of the Leg

The venous system of the leg consists of
both  a  superficial  and  a  deep  compo-
nent.  The  superficial  component  is
located  above  the  fascia,  and  the  deep
component  is  located  below  the  fascia.
The  principal  superficial  veins  are  the
lesser saphenous vein, which runs from
the  ankle  to  the  knee,  and  the  greater
saphenous  vein,  which  runs  from  the
ankle to the groin. The superficial veins
of  the  leg  connect  and  empty  into  the
deep  veins  via  perforating  veins,  which
pierce  through  the  fascia  separating  the
compartments of the leg. The skin surface
of the leg may consist of superficial pink
telangiectasias found in the papillary der-
mis that empty into blue-appearing retic-
ular  veins  found  in  the  reticular  dermis,
which empty into the superficial venous
system  located  above  the  fascia.  These
superficial  veins  drain  into  the  deep
venous system that is located below the
fascia  and  within  the  muscle.  Besides
being  identified  according  to  their  loca-
tion, veins can also be categorized by size.
Telangiectasias are flat red vessels that are
up to 1 mm in diameter, venulectasias are
bluish vessels that may distend above the
skin surface and are usually 1 to 2 mm in
diameter,  and  reticular  veins  are  those
that  have  a  cyanotic  hue  and  are  2  to 
4  mm  in  diameter.  Nonsaphenous  vari-
cose veins are 3 to 8 mm in diameter, and
saphenous  varicose  trunks  are  usually
greater  than  5  mm  in  diameter.  These
larger vessels typically lie deep below the
skin surface and are better visualized with
duplex ultrasound.

Varicose Veins

Veins  have  one-way  valves  that  occur
every few inches along their course and
are  positioned  to  oppose  back  flow  so
deoxygenated  blood  can  continue  to
flow in the direction of the heart. A vari-
cose vein is a vein that has lost its elastic-
ity. While any vein in the body may be
affected, the superficial veins of the legs
are by far the most frequently involved.
These  weakened  veins  dilate  under  the
pressure of supporting a column of blood
against  the  force  of  gravity. Varicose
veins have a caliber greater than normal,
and  their  valve  cusps  no  longer  meet.
They  are  incompetent  and  result  in

reflux.  Varicose  veins  impede  proper
circulation by permitting blood to flow
away from the heart, decreasing the effi-
ciency of the entire venous system, and
leading  to  venous  hypertension.  The
severity  of  venous  hypertension  is
directly related to the skin changes seen
in  chronic  venous  insufficiency.  The
progression  to  chronic  venous  insuffi-
ciency follows the leaking of fluids out
of the veins into the perivascular tissue,
engendering  symptoms  of  leg  swelling,
aching,  and  eventually  dermatologic
manifestations such as increased vascu-
lar  markings,  skin  discoloration  (hyper-
or  hypopigmentation  and  hemosiderin
deposition),  dermatitis,  fibrosis,  and
ulceration.

The  etiology  of  varicose  vein  forma-
tion is multifactorial. There is a familial
tendency to develop varicose veins, usu-
ally  in  patients  who  present  with  this
disease early in life. Its relation to gender
appears  to  be  a  more  significant  factor,
as  it  is  seen  in  approximately  26%  of
women versus 5% of men. In addition,
advancing age appears to be involved, as
those  older  than  age  35  almost  triple
their risk compared to those aged 24 to
35  years.2 Physical  states  that  increase
the  pressure  on  the  venous  system  by
physically compromising venous return,
such  as  pregnancy,  obesity,  decreased
mobility,  and  frequent  constipation,  are
also associated with an increased risk of
varicose vein formation.2–4 Other factors,
such  as  the  presence  of  estrogen,  have
been  shown  to  have  an  impact  on  the
vascular system. While estrogen appears
to  protect  against  the  formation  of
venous ulcers of the lower limbs,5 it has
been  implicated  in  raising  telangiectatic
matting  (the  appearance  of  tiny  vessels
less  than  0.2  mm  in  diameter),  which
occurs in women after undergoing scle-
rotherapy for the treatment of leg veins.6
Current research on the etiology and
pathology of varicose veins and chronic
venous  insufficiency  suggests  that  the
underlying  pathologic  mechanism  is  an
inflammatory response that is hypothe-
sized  to  be  initiated  by  an  increase  in
shear stress on the venous endothelium.
Several  studies  suggest  that  an  increase
in  venous  pressure  induces  leukocyte
accumulation and subsequent free radi-
cal production that leads to degradation
of valve leaflets by metalloproteinases,7–9
which  are  enzymes  that  degrade  colla-
gen,  elastin,  and  other  components  of
the  extracellular  matrix.  Based  on  this
free  radical-driven  model  of  venous

damage,  flavonoids  (plant-derived  free
radical scavengers) have been shown to
ameliorate  the  symptoms  and  progres-
sion of chronic venous insufficiency.10–13

EXAMINATION OF THE
SCLEROTHERAPY PATIENT AND
DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC
VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY

The current test of choice to investigate
blood  flow  in  the  superficial  and  deep
venous system is the duplex ultrasound.
This  test  is  indicated  for  symptomatic
patients and for patients who have clini-
cal  evidence  of  chronic  venous  insuffi-
ciency (see below). Duplex ultrasound is
more  reliable  than  Doppler  ultrasound
because  it  provides  actual  visualization
of veins. It is recommended that duplex
ultrasound  be  performed  on  the  upper
and  lower  leg  (superficial  and  deep
veins,  and  venous  perforators)  in  order
to accurately locate points of reflux that
should be targeted for treatment.14

Most  patients  with  chronic  venous
insufficiency  have  specific  symptoms
and  clinical  signs  that  reveal  their  dis-
ease  state.  A  detailed  clinical  examina-
tion  is  adequate  to  diagnose  most
patients suffering from primary varicose
veins,15 and  Doppler  vascular  studies
have been shown to be useful in patients
presenting with recurrent varicose veins
or obese patients with signs and symp-
toms  of  chronic  venous  insufficiency
with no clinically clear varicosity.16 Not
all  patients  with  venous  reflux  have
symptoms  of  chronic  venous  insuffi-
ciency,  but  patients  with  symptoms  of
chronic  venous  insufficiency  are  more
likely to have venous reflux. Moreover,
the degree of symptoms correlates with
the  degree  of  venous  disease.17,18 Pain
and  a  sensation  of  heaviness  are  the
most  common  symptoms  of  chronic
venous insufficiency,16,19 while edema is
the most frequent and the first objective
sign.19–21 Vessel  diameter  greater  than
approximately  4  mm  is  directly  related
to  the  likelihood  of  venous  incompe-
tence,22 and  patients  with  corona  phle-
intradermal
(fan-shaped 
bectatica 
telangiectasias in the medial and some-
times  lateral  portions  of  the  ankle  and
foot; Fig. 25-1) have a 4.4 times greater
risk  of  incompetent  leg  or  calf  perfora-
tors by duplex ultrasound than patients
without this clinical finding.23

Based on these current research find-
ings, the recommended approach to the
sclerotherapy patient is as follows: if the
patient  is  symptomatic  (reports  symp-

toms  of  leg  pain,  heaviness,  swelling,
aching,  cramping,  itching,  or  any  other
symptoms  attributable  to  venous  dys-
function),  vascular  testing  is  indicated.
Likewise, if the patient is asymptomatic,
but upon physical examination has two
or  more  of  the  following  symptoms,
vascular  testing  is  indicated:  signs  of
edema,  vessel  diameter  greater  than 
4 mm, corona of the lower extremities,
hyper- or hypopigmentation, dermatitis,
fibrosis,  and/or  current  or  healed  ulcer.
In addition, if there is a history of previ-
ous  sclerotherapy  with  poor  results,
such as recurrence of vessels or appear-
ance  of  new  vessels  in  the  previous
treatment area after sclerotherapy, then
vascular testing is indicated. Otherwise,
patients who present with leg telangiec-
tasias  with  or  without  reticular  veins
and  without  the  previously  listed  fea-
tures  may  be  presumed  to  be  cosmetic
treatment  candidates.  In  this  case,  the
treating physician may decide that these
patients  do  not  need  to  undergo  initial
vascular studies.

SCLEROSING AGENTS 

There are several studies in the literature
reporting  that  sclerotherapy  has  been
successfully  used  to  treat  both  func-
tional  and  cosmetic  vein  disorders.
When it performs as expected, the scle-
rosant 
the
endothelial  lining  of  the  vessel  wall
being  treated  and  results  in  inflamma-
tion, fibrosis, and in the eventual obliter-
ation of the vessel.

significantly  damages 

There are three classes of sclerosants
based  on  their  mechanism  of  action:
hyperosmotic  agents,  detergents,  and
chemical irritants. Hyperosmotic agents,
such  as  hypertonic  saline,  produce
endothelial  damage  through  dehydra-
tion.  Detergents,  such  as  sodium
tetradecyl  sulfate,  sodium  morrhuate,
ethanolamine  oleate,  and  polidocanol,
cause vascular injury by altering the sur-
face  tension  around  endothelial  cells,
diminishing  their  ability  to  adhere  to
one another. Chemical irritants, such as
chromated  glycerin,  injure  cells  by  act-

 
 
 
ing as a corrosive secondary to the metal
component.

Current  practice  includes  the  use  of
sclerosants in solution or those that are
manually  foamed.  Foamed  sclerosants
(either sodium tetradecyl sulfate or poli-
docanol mixed with air) are mainly used
to  treat  functional  vein  disorders,  such
as  chronic  venous  insufficiency  and
venous  ulceration  under  duplex-guided
ultrasound.24,25 This  approach  has  been
very  successful  for  the  medical  scle-
rotherapy  patient.  However,  a  known
risk of foam sclerotherapy includes tran-
sient vision disturbances.26

In  the  United  States,  the  only  agents
approved by the FDA for sclerotherapy are
sodium  tetradecyl  sulfate  (Sotradecol®),
sodium  morrhuate  (Scleromate®), and
ethanolamine oleate; the latter two have
an  extensive  side  effect  profile  and  are
used  primarily  for  esophageal  varices.
The  most  common  sclerosing  agent
used  in  dermatology  is  hypertonic
saline,  although  it  is  approved  as  an
abortifacient rather than a sclerotherapy
agent.  Chromated  glycerin  (72%  glyc-
erin  with  8%  chromium  potassium
alum, Scleremo®) is an agent recognized
for  superior  treatment  of  leg  telangiec-
tasias. In the treatment of telangiectatic
leg  veins,  chromated  glycerin  has  been
shown to clear vessels significantly bet-
ter than polidocanol in solution or poli-
docanol  foam.27 Chromated  glycerin  is
not FDA approved for sclerotherapy and
is  not  available  in  the  United  States;

however,  sterile  glycerin  is  available  on
hospital  formulary  for  use  in  cerebral
edema and acute glaucoma. A solution of
72% glycerin has been shown to clear leg
telangiectasias  significantly  better  and
with fewer complications (such as forma-
tion of microthrombi, telangiectatic mat-
ting, or hyperpigmentation) than sodium
tetradecyl  sulfate  in  solution.28 Used  in
this  nonchromated  form,  72%  of  sterile
glycerin solution is mixed in a ratio of 2:1
with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine (ratio
1:100,000  )  for  injection  into  leg  telang-
iectasias.28 Glycerin  alone  is  a  hyperos-
motic agent and it is likely that its mech-
anism  of  action  in  sclerotherapy  is
dehydration of the vessel wall, similar to
hypertonic saline. Other sclerosing solu-
tions that are not FDA approved include
polidocanol and polyiodinated iodine.

It  is  important  to  know  the  risk  pro-
files  of  commonly  used  sclerosants
(Table 25-1). Hypertonic saline is associ-
ated  with  burning  and  cramping  upon
injection and an increased risk of ulcera-
tive necrosis secondary to extravasation.
Sodium  tetradecyl  sulfate  has  also  been
associated with hyperpigmentation, pain
upon  extravasation,  and  skin  necrosis.
Rarely,  sodium  tetradecyl  sulfate  and,
even more rarely, polidocanol have been
associated with allergic hypersensitivity
reactions.  While  it  has  been  suggested
that  allergic  reactions  to  detergent  scle-
rosants  are  often  caused  by  solubilized
latex products from the rubber plunger in
the  syringe  into  the  sclerosant  solution,

this  has  not  been  substantiated  and
remains a subject of controversy. Overall,
the  estimated  incidence  of  allergic  reac-
tions is 0.3% and may occur with the use
of any sclerosing agent,29 as allergic reac-
tions  to  components  found  in  gloves,
syringes, and other supplies that come in
contact with a patient through treatment
can  arise.  As  such,  it  may  be  prudent  to
take at least 20 minutes for in-office obser-
vation  postprocedure  after  every  scle-
rotherapy  session,  especially  in  patients
with  a  history  of  asthma  or  a  history  of
allergies. Likewise, it is imperative to have
basic life support skills as well as subcuta-
neous  epinephrine,  intravenous  corticos-
teroids,  intravenous  antihistamines,  oxy-
gen,  and  other  resuscitative  equipment
readily  available  to  treat  this  potentially
life-threatening complication if it arises.

The  optimal  concentration  of  scle-
rosant  may  vary  with  the  diameter  of
the  vessel  being  treated,  with  a  greater
concentration  of 
sclerosant  being
required for vessels of larger diameter.30
If the sclerosant is too weak, insufficient
damage to the endothelium results and a
thrombus  may  form  that  eventually
recanalizes.  If  the  sclerosant  is  too
strong,  then  ulceration  and  hyperpig-
mentation can occur because of extrava-
sation of the sclerosant.

Management  of  side  effects  can  be  a
challenge.  While  pain  and  cramping 
are  acute  and  quickly  resolve,  hyperpig-
mentation, 
telangiectatic  matting, 
and  ulceration  are  more  chronic.

Hyperpigmentation after sclerotherapy is
delayed and can take several months to a
year  to  resolve.  It  has  been  associated
with  high  total  body  iron  stores.31 This
type  of  hyperpigmentation  is  caused  by
hemosiderin  deposition  and 
is  not
melanocytic;  therefore, 
it  does  not
respond  to  topical  bleaching  agents  as
much as to tincture of time. Telangiectatic
matting  is  usually  permanent  and  more
common in hyperestrogenemic states.6,32
It may also be a sign of underlying venous
reflux  and  should  be  investigated  by
duplex  ultrasound.  Both  hyperpigmenta-
tion and telangiectatic matting may bene-
fit  from  treatment  with  intense  pulsed
light  as  this  modality  has  shown  some
lesions,
success  in  treating  vascular 
including  telangiectasias,33,34 as  well  as
treatment  of  dyspigmentation.34,35 It  is
important  to  emphasize  that  necrosis
with  subsequent  ulceration  can  poten-
tially occur with extravasation of any of
the  sclerosants  into  the  skin  or  by  inad-
vertent  intra-arterial  or  periarterial  injec-
tion  of  sclerosants.  The  sclerosant  with
the  least  risk  of  inducing  necrosis  seems
to be glycerin, effective only for the treat-
ment  of 
telangiectasias.  When
extravasation  of  sclerosant  occurs  in  the
skin it is generally secondary to the treat-
ment  of  small  vessels,  such  as  telangiec-
tasias or reticular veins. This complication
presents  as  a  small  and  painful  slow-to-
heal blister, erosion, or ulceration. Healing
typically resolves with a skin-colored scar.
In contrast, reports of intra-arterial injec-
tion  occur  when  treating  larger,  deeper
vessels. This risk is increased when target-
ing veins around the ankle or when treat-
ing deeper veins, both cases where veins
and  their  accompanying  arteries  are  in
close  proximity  to  one  another.  When
arteries  are  accidentally  injected,  the
entire area supplied by the artery quickly
becomes ischemic and pale, and is usually
painful. In this situation, affected areas are
large,  involving  a  segment  of  the  leg  or
foot. Fortunately, intra-arterial injection is
a very rare event, but the risk is not com-
pletely avoidable and can still occur even
under  ultrasound  guidance.36 Manage-
ment  in  this  case  is  emergent,  and  may
result  in  possible  amputation.  To  mini-
mize  the  incidence  of  most  complica-
tions, use of proper injection technique is
critical. Using the minimal concentration
of sclerosant for the vessel size, small vol-
umes, and slow injection to maintain low
pressure in the vessel will assure the best
results.  Cosmetic  treatment  of  veins
around  the  ankle  with  sclerotherapy
should  be  avoided  and,  in  this  specific
group of patients, the possibility of reflux
should be explored.

SCLEROTHERAPY FOR 
THE COSMETIC PATIENT

When treating leg veins, it is important
to treat proximal sites and larger vessels
first,  as  treatment  of  these  vessels  may
obliterate those vessels that are smaller
and distally located. As previously men-
tioned,  cosmetic  treatment  is  under-
taken only if the patient does not have
any  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  of
chronic venous insufficiency or has had
all  sources  of  reflux  already  treated.
Preoperative  photographs  and  fully
informed  consent  outlining  all  possible
risks  and  complications  should  be
obtained  prior  to  therapy.  A  discussion
of postprocedure care is also essential.

A body map with segmental divisions
of  the  legs  is  helpful  in  documenting
each  session  (Fig.  25-2). Treatment  is
repeated at 6-week intervals to allow for
resolution  of  previously
complete 
treated  sites.  The  number  of  treatment
sessions  may  vary,  usually  from  one  to
six,  based  on  the  aggressiveness  of  the
physician as well as the clinical presen-
tation and expectations of the patient.

There  are  four  injection  techniques
commonly used in the treatment of cos-
metic  leg  veins:  the  puncture-fill  tech-
nique,  the  aspiration  technique,  the
empty  vein  technique,  and  the  air-bolus
technique.  The  puncture-fill  technique
relies on the feeling associated with perfo-
rating  a  vessel  wall.  It  is  probably  the
most common, but also the most difficult
to grasp for beginners and better mastered
over  time  while  using  the  other  listed
approaches.  The  aspiration  technique  is

most useful for the treatment of reticular
veins,  with  the  observation  of  the  aspi-
rated  dark  blood  into  the  hub  of  the
syringe or the tubing of a butterfly needle
confirming correct needle placement. The
empty vein technique involves leg eleva-
tion and kneading the vessel to remove as
much blood as possible prior to injecting
the  sclerosant.  The  air-bolus  technique
uses the injection of a small amount of air
(0.2 cc or less) prior to the introduction of
sclerosant. The air in the tip of the syringe
displaces the blood in the vessel confirm-
ing correct needle placement.

Alcohol  is  used  to  clean  the  skin  as
well  as  increase  the  refractile  index  of
the skin, rendering vessels more visible
upon  the  skin  surface.  A  common
approach by the author is to use a com-
bination  of  the  aspiration  and  empty
vein techniques for reticular veins, and
puncture-fill 
for  venulectasias  and
telangiectasias.  It  is  also  helpful  when
using the puncture-fill technique to tar-
get  the  most  superficial  portion  of  the
vessel.  For  telangiectasias  less  than 
1  mm  in  size,  where  cannulating  the
vessel  is  a  challenge,  it  is  necessary  to
start injecting with the tip of the needle
just barely underneath the skin surface,
bevel  side  facing  up  (Fig.  25-3). When
treating reticular veins, the use of a but-
terfly  needle  helps  to  secure  venous
access; however, prior to injecting these
vessels it is essential to pull back on the
plunger  to  visualize  dark  blue  blood  in
the  tubing  and  ensure  location  inside
the  lumen  of  the  vein  (Fig.  25-4).
Injection can then proceed slowly. In all
cases,  when  resistance  is  encountered,

Prior  to  injecting,  the  needle  may  be
bent  at  an  angle  of  20  degrees  to  45
degrees.  Upward  hand 
is
employed by the sclerotherapist using the
nondominant hand or by an assistant to
keep  the  skin  taut.  Sclerosant  is  injected
slowly to allow adequate time for contact
with  the  endothelium  as  well  as  to  pre-
vent  vascular  distention  and  rupture.  A
small amount of sclerosant is used at each
puncture  site  (approximately  0.1  to 
0.3 cc for telangiectasias and 0.5 to 1 cc for
reticular veins) in order to minimize side
effects  such  as  ulceration  caused  by

extravasation.  Reticular  veins  are  treated
at intervals of approximately 3 cm along
the length of the vessel, proximal to distal.
Larger vessels, such as reticular veins, are
injected  before  smaller  vessels,  such  as
venulectasias  and  telangiectasias,  and
areas  of  arborization  are  treated  before
isolated linear areas.

Immediately upon withdrawal of the
needle,  the  treatment  areas  should  be
compressed manually. Then each area is
taped  with  either  dry  cotton  balls  or
dental rolls, and wrapped with Coban or
an elastic wrap (Box 25-1). The patient is
instructed to keep this in place for a min-
imum of 4 hours, after which time grad-

uated compression stockings are substi-
tuted for an average of 1 to 3 weeks. The
garment  should  have  a  pressure  of  at
least 15 mm Hg. Compression therapy is
known to tighten the paracellular barrier
by elevating expression of specific tight
junctions,  inhibiting  permeability  of
fluid  into  the  perivascular  tissue,  and
thereby  preventing  progression  of
chronic  venous  insufficiency.37 It  also
decreases  symptoms  of  chronic  venous
insufficiency,38 such as pain and discom-
fort,39 as well as edema.40 While gradu-
ated  compression  garments  are  not
favorably  accepted  by  most  patients,
especially cosmetic patients in warm cli-
mates, it should be emphasized that the
use of these garments is associated with
greater clinical resolution and decreased
risk of hyperpigmentation.40

Lasers for Cosmetic Leg Veins

Laser leg vein treatment has been explored
with a variety of wavelengths, and the long-
pulsed 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser has shown
the  most  promising  results.41,42 However,
when compared with sclerotherapy in the
treatment  of  lower  extremity  telangiec-
tasias,  sclerotherapy  continues  to  offer
superior  clinical  results.41 Notably,  laser
therapy  should  only  be  an  option  for
patients  who  have  avoided  sun  exposure
to the intended treatment areas for several
weeks  prior  to  the  procedure  and  who
have Fitzpatrick skin type I to III. Primary
indications for laser or intense pulsed light
treatment of leg veins include ankle telang-
iectasias, needle phobia, and telangiectatic
matting or vessels too small to cannulate.
As with sclerotherapy, optimal results are
achieved  with  lasers  when  larger  feeding
vessels are treated first.

compression is of paramount importance
in slowing its progression and controlling
the  associated  symptoms.  Oral  agents,
like  flavonoids  (found  in  such  foods  as
citrus fruits, berries, green tea, red wine,
and dark chocolate with cocoa content of
at least 70%), have also proven to be ben-
eficial.  Similarly,  daily  intake  of  vitamin
C,  while  not  directly  investigated,  may
also  be  helpful.  Maintaining  an  active
lifestyle  and  avoiding  obesity  are  addi-
tional recommended measures.

Treatment  options  are  best  explored
after  duplex  ultrasound  examination
once all points of reflux have been deter-
mined.  Besides  sclerotherapy,  mainly
using the foamed method,24,25,43,44 other
types of procedures that can be used to
treat leg varicosities include ambulatory
phlebectomy, vein stripping and/or liga-
tion, or endovascular closure.

SUMMARY

Sclerotherapy remains the gold standard
for  treatment  of  cosmetic  leg  veins.
Optimal  results  occur  when  individual
patient  characteristics  are  evaluated,
thus separating the cosmetic sclerother-
apy patient from the medical sclerother-
apy patient. Sclerotherapy is a technique
that is mastered with practice. By under-
standing venous pathology and etiology,
and  by  being  able  to  choose  the  right
sclerosant  and  right  technique  for  the
vein  in  question,  a  successful  outcome
will surely be achieved.

Facial Scar Revision

Suzan Obagi, MD
Angela S. Casey, MD

Facial  scarring  is  a  common  complaint
among  patients  seen  by  cosmetic  der-
matologic  surgeons.  Several  etiologies,
including  inflammatory  acne,  trauma,
previous  surgical  procedures,  and  viral
infections  such  as  varicella  or  herpes
simplex, can lead to permanent scarring.
Treatment of scarring remains an evolv-
ing  subject  among  dermatologic  sur-
geons. In order to better understand the
optimal  treatments  for  facial  scarring,
we first explore the different morpholo-
gies of facial scars. This is followed by a
review of treatments grouped according
to  each  distinct  type  of  scar.  We  con-
clude with a discussion of combination
treatments  and  how  to  apply  these
modalities to the patient with acne scar-
ring to achieve the maximum results.

MORPHOLOGY OF ATROPHIC
SCARS

There  are  two  broad  classifications  of
facial  scarring:  atrophic  and  hyper-
trophic. This review focuses on atrophic
facial scarring. We expand upon the clas-
sification previously proposed by Jacob
et al.1 by dividing atrophic facial scarring
into  four  main  types:  ice  pick,  boxcar,
shallow/atrophic,  and  valley/rolling
scars (Fig. 26-1). Ice pick scars are typi-

(cid:2) FIGURE 26-2 Valley scars viewed in direct light (left) and indirect light (right).

cally  small  (1–2  mm)  and  have  a  wide
aperture with steep edges that taper to a
single point at the base, as if the skin has
been pierced by an ice pick. An epithe-
lial  tract  forms  along  the  sides  of  the
opening  within  the  scar.  These  scars
may  be  shallow  or  deep,  and  may
extend as far as the dermal–subcutaneous
junction. Boxcar scars are round to oval
in  shape  with  well-defined  vertical
edges and a flat base, as if the scar has
been punched out of the skin. They typ-
ically range from 0.1 to 0.5 mm in depth
and are usually widely spaced out on the
skin surface, occurring as solitary scars.
Unlike  ice  pick  scars,  this  type  of  scar
does  not  converge  to  a  single  point.
Shallow/atrophic  scars  present  as  a
cluster  of  miniaturized  boxcar  scars.
They usually emerge in groups of four or
more  and  occur  mainly  on  the  cheeks.
Valley  scars  (“rolling”  scars)  are  deeper
and have an undulating appearance that

is  best  appreciated  in  indirect  lighting 
(Fig.  26-2).  Valley-shaped  scars  arise
from  a  variable  loss  of  dermis  and/or
subcutaneous  tissue.  Because  acne  and
varicella  scars  are  dermal  defects,  they
require  a  treatment  modality  that
reaches  the  dermis  in  order  to  achieve
clinical improvement.

Pretreatment Considerations

Open communication and good rapport
with the patient cannot be emphasized
enough.  Patients  paying  for  cosmetic
procedures  tend  to  have  high  expecta-
tions  of  the  results;  therefore,  realistic
outcomes  of  the  various  treatment
modalities  must  be  discussed  in  detail
with the patient prior to the procedure.
Potential  side  effects  and  adverse  out-
comes  must  also  be  revealed  to  the
the  procedures.
patient  prior 
Additionally,  it  is  important  to  discuss
expected  “downtime”  and  possible  dis-
comfort  during  the  recovery  period.
Furthermore,  pre-  and  postoperative
skin  conditioning  regimens  as  well  as
necessary  time  and  monetary  invest-

ALGORITHM FOR ATROPHIC
SCARS
Ice Pick Scars

Because of the deep and steeply sloped
morphology  of  ice  pick  scars,  fillers  do
not  typically  produce  significant  cos-
metic improvement.7 Likewise, resurfac-
ing is not optimal since the depth of the
scar usually far exceeds that which can
be  safely  reached  with  resurfacing  pro-
cedures.  Therefore, 
treatment
choices  include  punch  excisions,  punch
grafts,  and  spot  trichloroacetic  acid
(TCA) peels (Fig. 26-3).

the 

PUNCH  EXCISION Punch  excision  and
punch  grafting  are  best  suited  for  ice
pick  scars  that  are  less  than  2  mm  in
diameter  (including  the  walls  of  the
scar); scars larger than 2 mm should be
excised  in  an  elliptical  fashion  and
closed in a layered manner. Punch exci-
sion describes a technique of eliminating
the  scar  through  the  use  of  a  trephine.
After infiltration of local anesthesia, the
smallest possible trephine that will com-
pletely remove the scar is used to punch-
excise  down  to  subcutaneous  fat.
Excisions of 1 mm in size are left to heal
by  secondary  intention.  Excisions  that
are 1 to 2 mm in size are closed with 5-0
nylon (Ethilon, Ethicon, Inc., Somerville,
NJ), with gentle eversion of the wound
edges.  Aquaphor  Healing  Ointment
(Beiersdorf, Inc., Wilton, CT) and a ban-
dage  are  then  placed  over  the  site.
Sutures  are  removed  at  1  to  2  weeks
(depending on skin thickness) following
the  procedure  to  prevent  track-mark
deformities.

PUNCH GRAFTING Punch grafts have been
used  for  many  years  as  an  option  for
treating pitted scars of the face,8,9 as well
as  scars  from  previous  surgical  proce-
dures.10 After local anesthesia, the scar is
removed  using  a  1-,  1.5-,  or  2-mm

trephine. The donor grafts are typically
obtained  from  the  postauricular  skin.
Donor  grafts  are  taken  0.5  mm  larger
than the excision, which allows for opti-
mal  alignment  after  healing  and  scar
contraction  take  place.  The  graft  is
placed  so  that  it  is  level  with  the  sur-
rounding  skin,  and  it  may  be  held  in
place  with  Steri-Strips  (3M,  St.  Paul,
MN).  The  donor  site  is  bandaged  as
described earlier. Approximately 6 weeks
following  graft  placement,  the  area 
can  be  leveled  with  dermabrasion,  if
necessary.

SPOT  TRICHLOROACETIC  ACID Another
effective treatment for ice pick scar revi-
sion  is  spot  treatment  with  TCA.  TCA
causes  precipitation  of  proteins  and
coagulative  necrosis  of  cells  in  the  epi-
dermis and collagen necrosis in the pap-
illary and upper reticular dermis. Dermal
collagen  production  and  remodeling
occurs  over  several  months  and  results
in dermal thickening. Lee et al. described
the  technique  of  using  a  sharpened
wooden applicator to firmly and directly
apply  65%  to  100%  TCA  into  the  ice
pick  scar.  They  found  that  the  applica-
tion of a higher TCA concentration was
more effective in treating atrophic acne
scars.11 Based  on  our  experience  with
this  method,  extreme  caution  must  be
used  since  the  application  of  such  a
strong  concentration  of  TCA  can  actu-
ally  cause  deepening  and  widening  of
scars.  We  prefer  using  30%  to  50%
TCA. These treatments can be repeated
at  6-week  intervals  until  satisfactory
results are achieved.

Boxcar Scars

Boxcar scars are round or oval in shape
with  well-defined  vertical  edges.
Varicella  and  herpes  simplex  scars  are
good examples. The difference in eleva-
tion requires that the base of the scar be
raised  to  the  level  of  the  surrounding

skin  or  that  the  surrounding  skin  be
planed  down  to  the  level  of  the  scar
base.  Options  for  treating  this  type  of
scarring  include  punch  elevation  or
resurfacing with dermabrasion, laser, or
modified  phenol  peels  (Fig.  26-4).
These  scars  do  not  respond  well  to
superficial  or  medium-depth  peels
because of the depth of the scar when
compared  to  the  surrounding  skin.
Additionally, the  underlying  fibrosis  of
the  dermis  in  these  scars  prevents  the
scar from stretching and smoothing out
with peels.

ELEVATION Punch 

PUNCH 
elevation
describes the technique of elevating tis-
sue within a depressed scar so that it is
level  with  the  normal  skin  surface  sur-
rounding it. When choosing a site to be
punch  elevated,  it  is  essential  that  the
scar  have  a  smooth,  normal  base  and
sharp  vertical  edges.  Using  a  trephine
that is equal in size to the inner diameter
of the scar, the inner aspect of the scar is
excised down to subcutaneous fat. The
tissue  is  then  elevated  to  sit  slightly
above  the  surface  level  of  the  skin  to
overcome the retraction that occurs dur-
ing the healing phase. The tissue may be
held  in  place  with  Steri-Strips  (3M,  St.
Paul,  MN)  or  5-0  or  6-0  polypropylene
(Prolene, Ethicon, Inc.). The area is ban-
daged  as  discussed  previously,  and  the
patient is seen in follow-up 1 week later
for suture removal/evaluation.

DEEP  PEELS/PHENOL  PEELS Phenol  peels
are deep peels that quickly penetrate the
skin to the level of the reticular dermis12;
the efficacy of the phenol is due to the
resulting protein denaturation and coag-
ulation as well as induction of new col-
lagen  synthesis.13
requires
hepatic  metabolism  followed  by  renal
excretion.  Systemic  absorption  of  phe-
nol  can  directly  cause  arrhythmias,  so
patients  must  be  on  a  cardiac  monitor
throughout the procedure.

Phenol 

One of the significant risks of phenol
peels is permanent hypopigmentation 14;
therefore,  careful  patient  selection  is
essential.  The  original  formulation  of
phenol and croton oil has been modified
to prevent the peel from penetrating as
deeply  as  the  Baker-Gordon  formula-
tion.  Both  Hetter  and  Stone  indepen-
dently described a modification of phe-
nol peels that yields better control over
depth  of  penetration.14,15 This  has
allowed  patients  with  various  skin
types  to  be  treated  with  favorable
results.16 While  laser  resurfacing  with
CO2 and  Er:YAG 
(erbium:yttrium-
aluminum-garnet) has  largely  replaced

peels  for  the  treatment  of  scars,  the
modified  phenol  peels  are  making  a
comeback.

DERMABRASION Dermabrasion  attempts
to  level  down  normal  skin  so  that  it  is
brought  close  to  the  depth  of  the  scar;
this method is very effective in creating
a  new  contour  plane.  However,  the
depth of the plane that can be achieved
with  dermabrasion  is  limited  as  exten-
sively  deep  abrading  can  cause  addi-
tional  scarring.  Wounding  to  the  depth
of papillary dermis produces “tightening”
while  a  wound  in  the  upper  reticular
dermis  results  in  “leveling.”  The  pres-
ence of pinpoint bleeding indicates abra-
sion to the level of the papillary dermis
while  continued  abrasion  reveals  the
parallel  lines  of  the  superficial  reticular
dermis.  When  frayed  white  strands  of
collagen  are  evident,  the  mid-reticular
dermis  is  visible  and  this  should  be  an
absolute  endpoint  as  further  invasion
may  lead  to  additional  scarring.  For  a
detailed description on the technique of
dermabrasion,  we  refer  the  reader  to
articles by Bradley and Park17 as well as
Orentreich and Orentreich.18

LASERS Both  ablative  and  nonablative
laser  resurfacing  have  been  effective  in
treating facial scarring, and these are dis-
cussed in detail below.19–24

Ablative lasers Ablative laser resurfacing
targets  and  vaporizes  water-containing
tissue,  thereby  allowing  epidermal
renewal as well as the reorientation and
regeneration  of  collagen  fibers  in  the
superficial  dermis.25–27 The  CO2 laser
has a wavelength of 10,600 nm and pri-
marily  targets  water  in  the  epidermis
and superficial dermis. The Er:YAG laser
has  a  wavelength  of  2940  nm,  which
corresponds  to  the  peak  absorption
coefficient of water. This laser produces
minimal  thermal  injury,  thereby  result-
ing  in  faster  reepithelialization  and  an

improved  side-effect  profile,  but  less
vascular coagulation as well as reduced
collagen contraction and remodeling.28,29
Combined  CO2/Er:YAG  is  a  com-
monly used treatment modality because
it  avoids  many  of  the  side  effects
encountered with pure CO2 laser treat-
ment  while  still  producing  a  satisfying
result.30 Following  the  procedure,  an
occlusive dressing is applied for 2 days;
for a comprehensive review of occlusive
dressings,  we  refer  the  reader  to  a
review  article  by  Newman  et  al.31 A
postprocedure wound care regimen con-
sists  of  Domeboro  compresses  (Bayer
Corp.,  Morristown,  NJ)  every  4  hours
and  Aquaphor  Healing  Ointment  or
Biafine  (OrthoNeutrogena,  Skillman,
NJ). Re-epithelialization typically occurs
in 7 to 10 days. If an occlusive dressing
is  used  for  more  than  48  hours,  pro-
phylaxis  with 
first-generation
a 
cephalosporin and fluconazole is recom-
mended  for  4  days,  starting  the  day  of
the procedure.3

Fractional  photothermolysis To  date,
there  have  been  few  controlled  studies
regarding  the  impact  of  fractional  pho-
tothermolysis  (Fraxel  Laser,  Reliant
Technologies, Inc., Mountain View, CA)
for treatment of scars; however, this rel-
atively  new  modality  has  had  reported
success in the treatment of hypertrophic
scars32 and atrophic scars.33–35 Fractional
photothermolysis  creates  hundreds  to
thousands  of  microthermal  zones
(MTZ), or microscopic columns of ther-
mal injury, sparing the tissue surround-
ing each zone.35–37 Fractional photother-
molysis has a 1550-nm wavelength and
targets  tissue  water  but  not  melanin,
allowing its use in patients with all skin
types;  the  depth  of  penetration  is
approximately 1500 (cid:2)m. The fractional
heating of the chromophore avoids bulk
heating of the skin and reduces the risk
of thermal injury to the dermis thereby
minimizing  the  chance  of  worsening

scarring.  Reepithelialization  takes  place
at  approximately  24  hours  posttreat-
ment.  The  stratum  corneum  remains
intact as it contains less water and there-
fore is not targeted.

In  our  experience,  results  with  frac-
tional  photothermolysis  are  still  not  as
dramatic  as  laser  resurfacing  plus  der-
mabrasion.  In  order  to  get  more  dra-
matic  clinical  results  with  fractional
photothermolysis high energies must be
used, which cause a recovery time that
approaches  that  of  traditional  resurfac-
ing  procedures.  However,  newer  frac-
tionated  carbon  dioxide lasers  are  on  the
market and comparative studies will be
very helpful.

Nonablative  lasers Nonablative  lasers
such  as  the  pulsed  dye  laser  (585–
600  nm),  long  wavelength  Nd:YAG 
(1320  nm),  and  the  long  wavelength
diode  (1450  nm)  can  produce  improve-
ment  in  boxcar  and  shallow  atrophic
scars. The pulsed dye lasers target hemo-
globin and are useful for pink scars that
are  still  exhibiting  collagen  remodeling
and  inflammation,  likely  through  elimi-
nation of blood vessels within the scar.38
Purpura is the main side effect of pulsed
dye  laser  treatment  and  can  last  up  to 
14  days;  however,  the  risk  of  hyperpig-
mentation should also be discussed with
the patient prior to treatment.

synthesis  by 

For  more  mature  scars  that  are  no
longer  exhibiting  collagen  remodeling,
the depth of the scarring process must be
taken  into  account  when  choosing  a
laser.  The  energy  from  the  laser  causes
partial denaturing of the collagen fibers;
in  response,  there  is  an  increase  in
collagen 
fibroblasts.
Synchronization  of  surface  cooling  and
heating  allows  control  of  the  depth  of
dermal  injury.39 Improvement  in  acne
scarring  following  treatment  with  the
1320-nm Nd:YAG laser (CoolTouch CT3
Laser,  CoolTouch,  Inc.,  Roseville,  CA)
has  been  demonstrated  in  numerous
studies.40–42 The  1450-nm  midinfrared
diode 
(SmoothBeam,  Candela
Corporation,  Wayland,  MA)  affects  the
dermis  between  100    and  500  (cid:2)m  of
depth.  Improvements  in  atrophic  acne
scars,43 as well as other atrophic scars,44
have been reported with this laser.

Shallow Atrophic Scars

Shallow  atrophic  scars  are  most  easily
thought of as mini-boxcar scars that occur
in  clusters.  They  are  most  commonly
located on the cheeks. Many of the same
treatment modalities that are used to treat
boxcar scars are also effective in treating

shallow  atrophic  scars.  These  scars
respond well to both ablative and non-
ablative  laser  resurfacing,  fractionated
lasers,  and  dermabrasion  just  as  boxcar
scars do (Fig. 26-5). Additionally, chemi-
cal  peels  may  be  used  to  improve  the
appearance  of  shallow  atrophic  scars,
especially  scars  that  are  “stretchable,”
meaning  that  the  scar  appearance  is
improved  with 
traction.
Chemical  peel  options  are  discussed  in
greater detail below.

lateral 

MEDIUM  AND  DEEP  CHEMICAL  PEELS Peel
depth is affected by acid concentration,
number  of  coats  applied  or  “passes,”
skin  thickness,  skin  preconditioning,
body surface being treated, and in some
instances, the duration of contact of the
acid  on  the  skin.  Keratolytics  are  used
for  superficial  exfoliation  and  are  not
discussed in this chapter as they do not
significantly  impact  the  deeper  scarring
of  atrophic  facial  scars.  Medium-depth
chemical  peels  destroy  the  stratum
corneum as well as epidermis and pene-

trate  into  the  papillary  dermis  causing
destruction,  protein  denaturation,  and
inflammation at a deeper level. This, in
turn, results in collagen remodeling and,
therefore,  scar  improvement  and  skin
tightening  (Fig.  26-6).  Examples  of
medium-depth  chemical  peels  include
TCA, and variations of TCA peels such
as  the  Obagi  Blue  Peel  (Obagi  Medical
Products,  Long  Beach,  CA),  TCA  and
Jessner’s  solution  (Monheit  peel),  or
TCA  combined  with  glycolic  acid
(Coleman  peel).  See 
“Deep

the 

Valley Scars

the 

subcutaneous 

Valley scars result from a defect in vol-
ume in the area of the scar. This loss of
volume may be at the level of the dermis
tissue.
or  of 
Correction  of  this  volume  loss  can  be
achieved  in  two  ways:  fillers  may  be
injected into the area of volume loss or a
reaction  may  be  induced  in  the  patient
that  will  result  in  collagen  remodeling

and  an  increase  in  collagen  volume  as
wound healing takes place (Fig. 26-7).

FILLERS Soft tissue fillers have been used
for  decades  in  the  correction  of  surface
deformities.  Several  factors  must  be
taken into consideration when choosing
a filling agent, including: duration of filler,
anatomic  location,  depth  of  scar  to  be
filled,  risk  of  allergic  or  granulomatous
reaction, and risk of infection. Also, any
history of keloid scar formation, known
allergy  to  any  components  of  the  filler,
active  infection  in  the  treatment  site,  or
history  of  autoimmune  disease  are  con-
traindications  to  using  fillers.  There  is  a
higher  risk  of  skin  necrosis  within  the
glabellar area in these procedures; there-
fore,  extra  care  in  this  region  is  advo-
cated.  The  most  important  predictor  of
filler  success  may  be  the  actual  texture
and  degree  of  fibrosis  in  the  scar  being
filled. When more fibrosis is present, less
correction is achieved with fillers.

Biologic Fillers
AUTOLOGOUS  FAT Perhaps  the  most  per-
manent  of  all  filling  substances,  autolo-
gous fat transfer offers many advantages
including the fact that it is nonimmuno-
genic, abundant in supply, and is a living
tissue with potential for permanent aug-
mentation.  There  is  debate  over  the
fragility of the adipocyte that predisposes
it to damage during harvesting, prepara-
tion,  and  implantation.  Atraumatic  har-
vesting of the fat is essential. Blunt can-
nulae or a 20-gauge needle may then be
used to place the fat into the desired area.
Special care must be taken to avoid caus-
ing an embolism with a sharp needle.

COLLAGEN Collagen  may  be  human-
derived  (CosmoDerm-I®/CosmoPlast®,
Allergan, Irvine, CA) from human fore-
skin fibroblast culture or bovine-derived
(Zyderm®/Zyplast®,  Allergan,  Irvine,

and  Drug
by 
Administration (FDA) in March 2003 for
the treatment of acne scars. It is placed
into the superficial dermis with a slight
degree  of  overcorrection,  while
CosmoPlast  is  placed  in  the  upper  to
middle dermis.

times  its  weight  in  water.  It  is  found
throughout the body in connective tissue
as  well  as  in  synovial  tissue  and  fluid.
Hyaluronic  acid 
is  marketed  as

POLY-L-LACTIC  ACID Poly-L-lactic  acid
Laboratories,
(Sculptra, 
Bridgewater,  NJ)  belongs  to  the  alpha
hydroxy acid family and Sculptra is com-
posed  of  crystalline,  irregularly  sized
microparticles  of  poly-L-lactic  acid  that
are 40  to 60 (cid:2)m in diameter. This syn-
thetic  polymer  has  been  approved  for
HIV-related  facial  lipoatrophy  by  the
FDA.  Sculptra  is  packaged  as  a  sterile
freeze-dried preparation that is reconsti-
tuted with sterile water 48 hours before
injection.  After  injection  of  the  poly-L-
lactic acid, a foreign body reaction occurs
over  several  weeks  to  months,  present-
ing  as  a  volumetric  expansion.45 It  is
important to note that there is no visual
endpoint at the time of injection, and a
waiting  period  of  at  least  4  to  6  weeks
after initial product placement is recom-
mended before subsequent injections.

Complications  of  poly-L-lactic  acid
include nodules (typically arising several
weeks  after  injection)  and  granulomas
(emerging  months  to  years  after  injec-
tion); incidence rates range from 6% to
52%.46 Early nodules may be broken up
with  needle  fragmentation  or  further
diluted with sterile saline. Late nodules
and  granulomas  typically  require  treat-
ment  with  excision;  steroid  injections
may  also  be  effective.  Metabolism
occurs  via  bioabsorption  and  gradual
degradation.

(CaHA) 

HYDROXYLAPATITE Calcium
CALCIUM 
(Radiesse®,
hydroxylapatite 
Bioform  Medical,  San  Mateo,  CA)  is  a
synthetic filler that typically lasts 12 to
18 months before subsequent injections
are  needed.47 Radiesse  was  recently
approved by the FDA for the correction
of moderate to severe facial folds, such
as nasolabial folds, as well as treatment
of HIV lipoatrophy. There is no need for
a  skin  test  prior  to  use,  and  the  correc-
tion  that  is  obtained  is  close  to  1:1,
meaning  that  no  expansion  of  the
implant will occur after injection. CaHA
has  been  used  for  superficial  depressed
scars48 and acne scars.49

Side  effects  are  generally  mild;  occa-
sionally,  nodules  may  form  following
treatment. This is especially more com-
mon  when  CaHA  is  used  in  the  lips.
Additionally,  CaHA  is  radiopaque,  so
patients  should  be  aware  that  it  may
appear on X-ray films or other imaging.

ARTEFILL Polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA)  (ArteFill®,  Artes  Medical,  San
Diego, CA) is a permanent dermal filler
that has been recently approved by the
FDA  for  the  correction  of  nasolabial
folds.  To  our  knowledge,  there  are  no
studies  examining  the  effectiveness  of
ArteFill  in  treating  facial  scarring.  The
concern with this filler agent is the risk
of  nodule  formation.  The  formulation

approved  for  use  in  the  United  States
has  undergone  changes  so  that  the
PMMA  beads  are  of  a  more  uniform
size  and  therefore  do  not  undergo
phagocytosis.

Subcision

Subcutaneous  incision,  or  subcision,  for
the  treatment  of  depressed  scars  was
first described in 1995.50 After outlining,
anesthetizing, and sterilizing the affected
areas,  a  22-gauge  needle  or  a  tribeveled
18-gauge  hypodermic  needle  (Nokor,
Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) is
inserted into the superficial fat with the
bevel up just adjacent to the scarred area.
The needle is turned so that the bevel is
perpendicular to the skin surface, and the
needle is moved back and forth in a fan-
ning motion to break up the fibrous tis-
sue  that  is  depressing  the  scar.  Audible
rasping  and  popping  is  observed  as  the
underside  of  the  dermis  is  released
from  its  subcutaneous  attachment.51
Following  the  procedure,  patients  can
expect bruising for up to 1 week.

The  exact  mechanism  of  action  of
subcision 
is  not  fully  understood.
Orentreich  and  Orentreich  described
two  mechanisms  including  release  of
tethers  that  bind  down  the  scar  and
reactive  formation  of  new  connective
tissue.50 Alam  et  al.  studied  the  effec-
tiveness of subcision on acne scarring in
40 patients and noted that the investiga-
tors  as  well  as  the  patients  found  that
subcision  improved  the  appearance  of
rolling acne scars.51

COMBINATION THERAPIES

Any individual patient may have several
different  morphologies  of  facial  scars
and  therefore  may  require  a  combina-
tion of treatments that targets each spe-
cific scar type. It is important to under-
stand the timeline of these combination
therapies and which treatments may be
employed  simultaneously  versus  those
that  are  spaced  out  several  months
apart; timing of combination treatments
depends  on  the  modalities  and  mecha-
nisms of action. Each patient is unique,
and clinical improvement may vary sig-
nificantly  among  patients.  We  recom-
mend  reassessment  of  the  patient  3  to 
6 months following treatment to deter-
mine  if  further  procedures  would  be
beneficial.  In  the  following  section,  we
present a general guideline of combina-
tion treatment options that may be con-
sidered in approaching the patient with
facial scarring.

Chemical Peels and Laser
Resurfacing

A  combination  of  chemical  peels  and
laser resurfacing at the same visit is ideal
for  patients  with  numerous  shallow
atrophic  scars  intermixed  with  deeper
boxcar scars. In these patients, chemical
peeling is performed first, as this works
at  a  more  superficial  level  compared  to
laser resurfacing and improves the con-
tour  of  the  shallow  atrophic  scars.  We
use 24% to 26% TCA as a peeling agent.
The chemical peel is applied to regions
of the entire face with emphasis on the
areas  with  shallow  atrophic  scarring.
The endpoint is a peel into the papillary
dermis or just into the reticular dermis.
In patients who also have ice pick scars
(in  addition  to  shallow  atrophic  and
boxcar scars), straight 30% TCA is used
to  spot  treat  the  ice  pick  scars.  At  the
conclusion  of  the  peel,  the  skin  is
cleansed to remove excess peel solution.
We then use the CO2/Er:YAG laser over
the  entire  scarred  area  in  order  to
smooth  out  the  contour  of  the  skin,
focusing on areas that have deeper box-
car-type  scars.  The  combination  treat-
ment  allows  blending  of  the  treated
areas  while  optimizing  the  improve-
ment of each distinct scar type.

Fractional  photothermolysis  may
also  be  used  in  combination  with
chemical peeling for patients with shal-
low  atrophic  and  boxcar  scars.  In  this
scenario,  the  chemical  peel  is  applied
during  the  first  treatment  session  to
the  entire  scarred  area.  Approximately 
3  months  after  the  peel,  the  patient
returns to the office for reevaluation. At
that point, fractional photothermolysis

may be used to correct any deeper box-
car scars or shallow atrophic scars that
have  not  responded  to  the  chemical
peeling.  Alternatively,  the  patient  may
undergo  fractionated  laser  treatments
over  the  areas  of  deeper  acne  scarring
followed  immediately  by  the  perfor-
mance  of  a  chemical  peel.  If  this
approach  is  employed,  care  must  be
taken  so  that  the  chemical  peel  does
not  penetrate  more  deeply 
than
intended.

Laser Resurfacing and
Dermabrasion

Laser  resurfacing  plus  dermabrasion  is
another option for patients with a com-
bination  of  shallow  atrophic  scars  and
deeper boxcar scars (Fig. 26-8). The laser
is used over the entire scarred area or on
the entire face (if clinically beneficial to
reduce  photodamage  as  well)  to  both
ablate and tighten the skin. At the same
visit,  following  laser  resurfacing,  der-
mabrasion  is  then  used  to  plane  down
the skin that is elevated relative to any
remaining  atrophic  areas  and  smooth
out  the  contours  of  the  entire  skin  sur-
face;  this  achieves  a  more  level  surface
topography.52

Subcision and Fractional
Photothermolysis

Subcision  may  be  combined  with  frac-
tional photothermolysis to treat patients
who  have  a  combination  of  valley-
shaped  scars  and  boxcar  or  shallow
atrophic scars. Subcision targets the val-
ley-shaped  scars  while  fractional  pho-
tothermolysis may be used to treat any

residual  boxcar  or  shallow  atrophic
scars.  These  two  treatments  can  be
employed  on  the  same  day  as  long  as
they  are  not  performed  on  the  same
scars.  Alternatively,  the  subcision  treat-
ments  may  be  performed  at  3-month
intervals  until  a  satisfactory  degree  of
filling is achieved. At that point in time,
fractional  photothermolysis  may  be 
performed.

Subcision and Laser Resurfacing
with the 1320-nm Nd:YAG Laser

As  previously  mentioned,  subcision
alone is effective in the treatment of val-
ley-shaped  scars  but  can  be  associated
with  a  fairly  common  risk  of  dermal
nodule  formation.  To  reduce  this  risk,
we  have  found  that  nonablative  laser
therapy with the 1320-nm Nd:YAG laser
(CoolTouch-CT3)  is  effective  if  started 
1 week after subcision.53 The laser treat-
ments are performed at 2-week intervals
for a total of six treatments.

Laser Resurfacing/Dermabrasion/
Subcision/Fillers/Chemical Peel

Patients  with  a  combination  of  shallow
atrophic scars and boxcar scars may also
have  coexistent  deeper  valley-shaped
scars at a depth that does not maximally
respond to dermabrasion and laser resur-
facing  alone.  After  completion  of  der-
mabrasion and laser resurfacing, a series
of  two  to  three  subcision  treatments
may  be  required  to  address  the  valley
scars.  If  the  patient  still  has  atrophic
areas  following  the  above  treatments,
dermal  fillers  are  ideal  for  evening  out

any  remaining  discrepancies  in  contour.
We do not advocate using fillers immedi-
ately  prior  to  laser  resurfacing  as  the
effects  of  laser  energy  on  various  fillers
have not been well studied.

Fulton and Silverton described a com-
prehensive and aggressive resurfacing of
the  acne-scarred  face  employing  these
treatments.  They 
started  with  a
Jessner’s/TCA peel on the chest and neck
regions  (and  other  areas  that  are  not
resurfaced  by  the  CO2 laser).  Atrophic
valley scars were then filled with adipose
tissue.  After  adipose  tissue  infiltration,
CO2 laser resurfacing and then dermabra-
sion were performed. This was followed
by  laser  touch-up  with  the  CO2 laser.
Then excision and/or grafting were per-
formed, and finally manual dermabrasion
was  applied  to  any  transition  zones  or
residual 
irregularities.  Postoperative
semiocclusive  wound  dressings  were
placed  after  the  above  procedures  were
completed. The authors found a 75% to
80% improvement of acne scars.52

Punch Excision and Laser or
Dermabrasion

Punch excision may be used at the same
time as skin resurfacing (Fig. 26-9). Upon
completion  of  the  skin  resurfacing  pro-
cedure with laser or dermabrasion, any
remaining ice pick scars up to 2 mm in
size  can  be  punch  excised  as  discussed
earlier.  The  advantages  of  performing
the punch excision at the same time as
the skin resurfacing are to combine pro-
cedures  (thus  reducing  recovery  time)
and to allow the sutures to heal with less
noticeable  marks  on  the  skin  since  the

entire 
reepithelialization.

SUMMARY 

There are many treatment options avail-
able  for  facial  scars.  Proper  patient
assessment,  determination  of  scar  mor-
phology,  and  selection  of  the  appropri-
ate  treatment  modality  are  essential
when addressing facial scarring. It is also
necessary to bring patients back for reg-
ular follow-up 3 to 6 months after treat-
ment (in addition to routine postproce-
dure  follow-up)  to  properly  assess
efficacy of any given treatment. Finally,
use  of  a  pre-  and  posttreatment  skin-
conditioning  regimen  will  optimize
patient  outcomes.  Recent  technologies
in  skin  resurfacing  enhance  more  tradi-
tional  therapies  and  allow  us  further
options in selecting the best treatments
for our patients.

Starting a Skin Care
Product Line

Leslie Baumann, MD

The notion of developing one’s own line
of  skin  care  products  to  offer  patients
and, possibly, the general public, may be
inspired by the sight of infomercials for
very  popular  formulations  designed  by
dermatologists, or hearing about practi-
tioners who sell their own product lines,
or even the realization that such a step
just  seems  to  be  the  logical  way  to
expand a successful cosmetic dermatol-
ogy  practice.  Regardless  of  its  origins,
the prospect of starting one’s own line of
products  is  pondered  by  an  increasing
number of cosmetic dermatologists.

On the surface it may appear that the
act of developing one’s own line of skin
care  products  is  a  scientific  enterprise;
however, the bottom line is that design-
ing one’s own product line is very much
a business. The process may include sci-
ence  (although,  unfortunately,  it  often
does not include enough), as it certainly
includes chemistry. However, designing
a  line  of  skin  care  products  involves
much  more  than  just  scientific  knowl-
edge. Business experience, which many
cosmetic  dermatologists  may  lack,  is
required.  This  chapter  will  discuss  the
challenges  inherent  in  starting  one’s
own line of skin care products.

QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER 
BEFORE DRAWING UP THE 
BUSINESS PLAN

Before  embarking  on  the  arduous  jour-
ney  of  initiating  one’s  own  line  of  skin
care products, it is advisable to explore
the motivating factors. Specifically, it is
incumbent upon the professional who is
weighing  such  a  business  decision  to
consider  the  following  questions:  Why
are  you  thinking  about  starting  your
own line of skin care products? Are your
patients  consistently  dissatisfied  with
what they find on their own or with for-
mulations  for  which  you  offer  either  a
ringing  endorsement  or,  maybe,  just  a
tepid  nod? Is  your  chemistry  back-
ground sufficient? Do you have an inno-
vative  approach  to  product  develop-
ment? Are you simply trying to take the

next step in the evolution of your thriv-
ing cosmetic dermatology practice? The
practitioner  who  asks  such  questions
might find that the answers stop them in
their tracks or lead them to getting their
feet and hands a little dirty in a challeng-
ing new business.

THE BUSINESS (AND COSTS) 
OF DEVELOPING SKIN 
CARE PRODUCTS

Few,  if  any,  cosmetic  dermatologists
who  contemplate  this  venture  are
chemists.  Therefore,  it  is  unlikely  that
physicians preparing to launch a product
line would be able to create the formulas
necessary  to  develop  new  products.  In
this  scenario,  thousands  of  dollars  in
investment would be needed to accom-
pany  the  creation  of  new  formulas.  In
most  cases,  however,  the  physician  is
striving  to  rebrand  quality  products
already  on  the  market.  Essentially,  this
means going to manufacturers and pay-
ing  them  to  tweak  current  formulas
with  signature  ingredients  so  as  to  dif-
ferentiate their brand and package them
under  the  physician’s  name  for  limited
distribution. In a few cases, the derma-
tologist may pay to test a new formula
before generating the new line.

In  either  of  the  main  scenarios,
payment  is  not  a  simple  matter.  There
are  costs  associated  with  each  step  of
the  process.  First,  the  physician  must
decide  on  the  volume  of  the  order,  the
time  frame  or  launch  date,  and,  of
course, the ingredients.

Volume

The  volume  of  the  order  is  always  the
first item on the agenda. Deciding on the
initial  supply  can  be  tricky  because  it  is
difficult to predict demand. Practitioners
must factor into this decision the under-
standing  that  the  minimum  quantities
required range across manufacturers, and
companies  adjust  minimum  quantity
requirements based on the type of pack-
aging  selected.  A  survey  of  companies
conducted by the author revealed that if
you  are  planning  to  change  an  existing
formula or packaging, most manufactur-
ers  would  consider  this  your  “run”  (or
requested  supply)  and  require  a  mini-
mum of 2500 to 5000 units per product in
the  line.  One  small  company  requires
minimums  as  low  as  12  to  36  pieces,
depending on the item, for products that

they  already  carry  and  simply  need  to
relabel. (However, this company requires
a minimum order of 5000 to 10,000 units
per  product  for  a  practitioner’s  own
unique formulation—the range is related
to  the  complexity  of  the  project  and/or
custom  packaging,  with  a  higher  mini-
mum required for more complex work.)
Most  stipulated  a  minimum  of  10,000
pieces.  One  company  requires  25,000
units when the practitioner requests that
the  formulation  be  packaged  in  tubes.
Packaging is the next major decision.

if  gold 

Deciding  on  the  type  of  packaging  for
each item in the product line is part and
parcel  of  placing  a  product  order.
Products are typically packaged in tubes,
bottles,  jars,  and  airless  pump  contain-
ers. Jars tend to be more expensive, par-
ticularly 
tops  are  used.
Companies generally try to match prod-
ucts  with  the  appropriate  packaging—
sunscreens  in  tubes,  liquids  in  bottles,
creams  in  jars,  and  serums  in  airless
pump bottles. Some companies use only
plastic  containers,  which  confer  several
advantages  such  as  reduced  breakage,
lighter  shipping  weight,  and  ease  of
labeling.  However,  the  wrong  grade  of
plastic, regardless of the packaging, can
adversely  affect  the  stability  of  a  prod-
uct. Also, it is important to note that in
the case of products with active ingredi-
ents  (i.e.,  sunscreens,  acne  products,
etc.),  changing  even  one  ingredient  or
any  part  of  the  packaging  requires 
90-day  stability  testing  in  order  to
achieve 2-year expiration dating.

Labeling  is  another  important  aspect
of  product  packaging,  as  costs  and  aes-
thetics  must  be  considered.  Setting  up
printing  plates  for  labeling  and  using
multiple  colors  can  be  quite  expensive.
Some  companies  employ  one  or  more
in-house  graphic  artists  whose  services
do not result in any extra charges. When
this  service  is  not  available,  or  when  a
physician  wants  more  input,  a  $300
plate fee per color is typical for this more
elaborate  but  still  downscale  labeling
approach.  For  example,  if  a  dermatolo-
gist chooses to create a logo in red and
green, along with the copy in black, the
cost  would  be  for  the  one-time  setup
charge  of  three  color  plates  or  $900.  If
multiple  products  are  to  be  included  in
the line, all colors on the labels, as well
as  the  size  of  the  labels,  might  be  kept
the  same,  with  only  a  slight  change  in

copy  made  to  distinguish  the  different
products.  In  this  case,  only  one  addi-
tional plate (at $300) would be needed.
This is an unrealistic scenario, however,
simply to illustrate the cost structure of
printing.  A  more  realistic  scenario  is  a
line that includes products for different
uses,  necessitating  various  container
sizes. In turn, various label sizes would
be needed for suitable fit and presenta-
tion (e.g., an 8-oz bottle for a cleanser, a
1–2-oz jar for a facial moisturizer, a 4-oz
tube  for  sunscreen,  and  a  1-oz  bottle
with  pump  dispenser  for  a  skin  light-
ener).  In  this  scenario,  initial  printing
plate  charges  would  be  multiplied  by
the  number  of  different  size  containers
in  the  product  line.  It  is  important  to
note  that  with  the  rising  popularity  of
digital  technology,  plate  charges  are
slowly  waning.  Of  course,  technology
still varies among label companies.

Labels  themselves  are  inexpensive
(usually ranging from $0.10 to $0.50 per
label depending on colors and finish), but
may influence the volume order because
some  companies  may  require  at  least
5000 labels per product. Label material is
another  cost  variable.  Regular  paper
labels that include some minimal protec-
tive coating, neither waterproof nor suffi-
cient  to  prevent  creasing  if  the  bottle  is
squeezed,  are  the 
least  expensive.
Polylaminate  or  vinyl  labels  that  are
water-  and  weatherproof  as  well  as
slightly elastic, thus retaining form upon
being squeezed, are superior and slightly
more  expensive  (Table  27-1).  Although
additional  design  costs  are  not  uncom-
mon, the physician is really getting scant
more than her/his name and address on
the  product.  In  order  to  achieve  an
upscale  look  for  a  finished  product  it  is
often  recommended  that  the  packaging
be “screened” (in other words, getting the
product  labels  silkscreened  onto  the
package  as  opposed  to  having  them
painted).  This  usually  involves  a  one-
time setup charge with the screener, run-

TABLE 27-1
Product Label Quote Rangea

ning between $500 and $1000 per prod-
uct with a lead time ranging from 3 to 4
weeks.  Once  the  manufacturer  receives
the  screened  product,  they  will  process
the  order.  Physicians  marketing  only
through  their  offices  need  not  screen
products but it is often recommended for
those  who  are  marketing  products
through upscale department stores or on
a home shopping network, such as QVC
or HSN, or on an infomercial. Pricing for
screening varies based on quantity to be
screened and the number of colors used.
In  most  cases,  the  use  of  silkscreening
would  be  considered  for  runs  of  5000
units  or  more.  Manufacturers  typically
have  relationships  with  screening  com-
panies.  The  benefit  of  having  labels
silkscreened  is  that  such  labels  do  not
peel off or scuff and, therefore, are ideally
suited 
imparting  an  upscale 
for 
appearance.

Usually available in the United States,
ordinary  packaging  is  associated  with
lead times of 6 to 8 weeks and minimum
orders of 2500 to 10,000 pieces. High-end
or upscale packaging minimums tend to
range  from  25,000  to  50,000  pieces,
accompanied by a lead time of anywhere
from 8 to 15 weeks. Most upscale pack-
aging is obtained from Italy, Spain, South
Korea, and China, with little available in
the  United  States.  Most  physicians
naïvely begin the ordering process with a
plan to custom design their product pack-
ages,  but  quickly  revise  their  expecta-
tions when confronted with the prospect
of  exorbitant  packaging  and  labeling
costs. Physicians also have to cover ship-
ping costs to the point of delivery, usually
the clinical practice. When feasible, costs
can be reduced by shrewd, frugal manip-
ulation of package minimums (e.g., pack-
aging  products  together,  netting  two  or
three  products  per  30,000-piece  mini-
mum  versus  one  product  per  30,000-
piece minimum).

Overall  costs  per  unit  are  especially
important  for  a  would-be  product

designer  to  consider.  A  low-end  simple
cleanser or lotion might range from $2 to
$2.50 per unit; medium-range products,
$3  to  $6  per  unit.  Sophisticated  prod-
ucts,  which  might  include  advanced
liposome  delivery  systems  or  bio-  or
nanotechnology, could be as high as $7
at the low end and as high as $20 or $30
per unit for the most advanced products.
Such products can usually be purchased
in smaller minimum quantity sizes, so it
is  reasonable  to  expect  to  pay  from
$20,000 to $25,000 per product.

Product Choices: Rebranding,
Timing, and Starting from Scratch

A typical range of products in a derma-
tologist’s  own 
includes  basic
line 
cleansers;  bleaching  agents;  shampoos;
AHAs;  sunscreens;  topical  antioxidants
such  as  green  tea,  grape  seed  extract,
and  stable  vitamin  C;  growth  factors;
retinols;  and  even  new  AHA  and  sun-
screen  formulations  that  incorporate
antioxidants and liposomal delivery sys-
tems.  Companies  that  provide  such
OTC  and  private-label  products  cite
ease  of  manufacture,  high  patient  and
physician  satisfaction,  and  stability  of
products.  Stable,  efficacious  skin  care
products  are  not  easy  to  formulate,
however.

The  easiest,  lowest-risk  approach  to
starting one’s own line is to work with
one  of  the  smaller  companies  that
already carries the type of product(s) of
interest  and  requires  low  minimums  in
the initial order volume. If this rebrand-
ing  is  successful,  new  products  can  be
easily  added  to  the  line.  At  that  point,
the physician might want to branch out
with a unique formula or two.

From conception of the plan to release
of  a  new  line  of  products,  developing  a
new cosmetics or cosmeceutical line can
take anywhere from 6 months to a year.
If a practitioner is able to quickly identify
a company to work with and that com-
pany already provides the desired prod-
ucts  for  rebranding,  the  business  could
take off in a few months. If a practitioner
hopes to peddle a unique formula, there
are  additional  associated  financial  and
time  costs.  Developmental  laboratory
fees  can  range  from  $15,000  to  $50,000
per  product.  (Simple  formulations  pro-
duced at smaller laboratories more likely
incur research and development charges
of $1000 to $5000.) In addition, the FDA
requires a 90-day stability assessment for
an  established  product  that  is  to  be
tweaked  with  the  addition  of  a  new
ingredient  or  two  according  to  a  physi-
cian’s specifications.  If  a  physician

 
 
 
decides  to  change  the  packaging  on  an
established product, retesting is required.
The same is true if anything is changed
in  the  formulation  (e.g.,  adding  or
removing a fragrance or an antioxidant).
It  is  recommended  that  more  than  one
variation  of  the  formulation  be  submit-
ted simultaneously in case one separates.
It  is  best  to  order  packaging  at  least 
2 months into the stability-testing process.
Although a product may be perfectly sta-
ble, some types of packaging might not be
ideally  suited  to  it.  Experienced  formula-
tors  should  know  which  resins  have  the
best track records in terms of maintaining
stability  when  exposed  to  certain  ele-
ments or compounds (e.g., light exposure
causes  decomposition  of  antioxidant
products). It takes 2 to 4 months for pack-
aging  to  arrive,  and  typically  another 
3 weeks or more for inclusion in the man-
ufacturing schedule (once all components,
including  packaging,  have  arrived  at  the
manufacturer’s plant).

Formulating  new  products  from
scratch, rather than relabeling, is an eas-
ier enterprise if the product is a nondrug,
which  contains  no  active  ingredient  as
defined  by  the  FDA.  Examples  include
antioxidant  products,  cleansers,  sham-
poos, and AHAs. Stability does not have
to  be  established  in  these  cases.  Some
companies  will  still  perform  such  test-
ing, though, as they prefer to manufac-
ture  under  pharmaceutical  guidelines.
As  stated  previously,  prescription  or
OTC  drugs  (defined  as  containing  an
active ingredient and listed on the back
label)  must  undergo  stability  testing.
Examples of these products include sun-
screens,  prescription  and  OTC  acne
products, and antifungals.

Testing, Promotional Considerations
and Costs in Dollars and Time

Implicit in the timeline cited above is a
substantial  amount  of  personal  (and,
possibly, personnel—depending on how
many people a physician has employed
to  devote  to  the  start-up)  time  con-
sumed in the development and product
launch process. If the practitioner is not
taking  a  half-year  sabbatical,  a  signifi-
cant  commitment  of  staff  time  will  be
required from those with strong critical
thinking and executive decision-making
skills  to  orchestrate  and  supervise  a
process  that  involves  a  wide  array  of
diverse  professionals—manufacturers,
formulating chemists, packaging compa-
nies,  graphic  artists,  printers,  trucking
and logistics companies, and, ultimately,
banks  and  finance  companies,  if  the
physician does not plan to pay for every-

thing  out  of  pocket.  Once  the  product
line  has  been  manufactured,  marketing
and  promotion  costs  come  into  play.
Promotional  pamphlets  and  brochures
must  be  designed  and  printed  to  coin-
cide  with  the  introduction  of  the  prod-
uct  line,  which  is  best  accompanied  by
an advertising and public relations cam-
paign. Such necessary business adjuncts
comprise  some  of  the  additional,
arguably  hidden  or  initially  ignored,
associated  costs  of  launching  a  product
line  that  a  physician  must  consider
before deciding to embark on this chal-
lenging venture.

At  this  point,  it  should  be  clear  that
the  cost  stream  involved  in  creating  a
product line is quite extensive. As men-
tioned  above,  additional  costs  are
incurred  from  stability  testing.  For
example, the FDA requires in vivo stud-
ies (with a minimum of five patients) to
validate  SPF  claims  for  sunscreen  prod-
ucts  or  formulations  with  SPF  claims.
Costs depend on the complexity of the
study and the number of study subjects,
but  typically  range  from  $5000  to
$25,000.  Practitioners  opting  simply  to
relabel  an  existing  product  with  their
own name are usually given permission
by  the  sunscreen’s  manufacturer  to  use
their  validation  data.  New  validation
studies are mandatory for new formula-
tions. If a practitioner chooses to include
three products that have SPF (e.g., sun-
screen, a skin lightener with SPF, and an
AHA  body  lotion  with  SPF),  three  SPF
validation studies would be required. It
is  important  to  note  that  the  FDA
requires  two  forms  of  stability  testing
on prescription and OTC drugs. The 90-
day  accelerated  program  allows  for  a
product  launch  with  a  2-year  shelf  life.
This is followed by ongoing 2-year real-
time  stability  testing.  It  is  important  to
note that the FDA’s final monograph on
sunscreen,  issued  and  debated  since
1999 but not yet enforced, recommends
a  minimum  of  20  SPF  test  subjects  as
well  as  a  UVA  test  requirement  (only
UVB  testing  is  conducted  currently).1
Such policies, once implemented, would
lead to higher costs for sunscreen devel-
opers  that,  in  turn,  would  be  borne  by
physicians  starting  their  own  product
lines.

FINAL MARKETING QUESTIONS 
TO CONSIDER

To start a successful product line, a well-
organized  business  plan  is  necessary.  If
you  plan  to  create  (not  just  label  with
your  name)  and  market  your  line

beyond  the  scope  of  your  practice,
remember that you are competing with
professionals,  people  backed  with  sig-
nificant funding, purchasing teams, and
strong business plans. It is worth noting
that  not  even  all  of  their  projects  suc-
ceed.  For  every  success,  such  as  Rodan
and  Field’s  Proactiv,  there  are  several
flashes in the pan—lines that last a few
weeks and then fizzle.

Although  infomercials  represent  an
obvious  marketing  route,  given  the
example of Proactiv, they are hardly the
best  first  approach  to  marketing.  This
leads  to  fundamental  sales  questions
that are important to ask oneself as part
of an initial business plan when mulling
over starting a product line: Where and
how  will  you  sell  your  products? Will
you  mass  market,  through  companies
such  as  Wal-Mart,  K-Mart,  or  Target?
Will you focus on pharmacy chains such
as  CVS,  Walgreens,  or  Eckerd? Do  you
have  the  contacts  there  to  facilitate
sales? A  sound  business  plan  will
address these questions. Mass marketers
want  to  know  the  practitioners’  plans
for  “moving”  or  selling  their  product
line.  Accordingly,  they  will  want  to
know the advertising schedule and pub-
lic  relations  program.  The  Internet,  of
course,  is  another  popular  sales  option.
Cursory  consideration  of  this  approach
is  appealing  because  the  overhead
appears  to  be  low.  In  addition,  most
practitioners  probably  know  someone
who  can  create  an  attractive  Web  site.
However,  it  takes  money  to  pay  for
advertising  links  to  steer  people  to  a
Web  site.  An  advertising  budget  and
public  relations  campaign  will  still  be
necessary. It should be noted that, anec-
dotally, online sales by most practition-
ers selling private-label lines are dwarfed
by in-office sales.

Some practitioners hoping to sell their
own  products  may  rely  on  sales  to  col-
leagues (via exhibit hall booths at confer-
ences) or vending the private-label prod-
ucts in their colleagues’ offices. However,
only  Obagi  has  been  successful  at  this.
Besides  offering  something  innovative,
Obagi  had  public  relations  support  and
educational seminars. It is not easy to sell
to physicians, particularly when peddling
a variation of something already widely
available.  An  expansive,  expensive  sales
force  and  support  staff  would  likely  be
necessary to even have a chance at selling
a  private  line  this  way.  For  physicians
choosing  to  limit  sales  to  their  own
offices, the best bet is to arrange to sell an
established  product  line  relabeled  under
one’s  own  name.  Convinced  that  their
idea is a surefire hit, some physicians ask

manufacturers  to  fund  their  start-up.
When  companies  can  own  the  project
and simply hire a spokesperson, though,
there is scant incentive for them to fund a
speculative start-up.

Whether  you  sell  products  in  your
office, online, or in a store, a significant
concern  is  how  to  make  sure  that  the
customers  who  buy  your  products  are
using  the  right  products? Using  the
Baumann  Skin  Typing  System  (BSTS)
discussed in Chapter 9 can greatly sim-
plify this. The BSTS divides people into
16  skin  types  based  on  skin  hydration,
sensitivity,  pigmentation  tendency,  and
extent  of  photoaging.  This  allows  the
user  to  accurately  determine  what
ingredients are most efficacious for each
of  the  16  skin  types.  The  system
can be used by registering at www.Skin
IQ.com.  Once  you  are  accepted  and
given  a  password,  you  can  invite  con-
sumers  to  complete  the  online  quiz  to
determine their skin type. Once you and
they know their skin type, you can eas-
ily suggest which products are right for
them.  If  you  would  like  to  label  your
products  with  the  various  Baumann
Skin  Type  Designations, 
contact
info@skintypesolutions.com  to  learn

how  to  proceed.  In  addition,  you  may
choose  to  set  up  an  online  store  to  sell
your products and use the BSTS to help
the customers know which products are
right  for  their  skin  as  is  done  at
www.Baumannstore.com.  For  informa-
tion  about  using  the  questionnaire,

SUMMARY

For the cosmetic dermatologist or other
practitioner  thinking  about  starting
one’s  own  line  of  products  to  offer  to
her/his patients, it is essential to under-
stand that this is a business, not medical,
matter. It is also a big business decision
at  that,  insofar  as  significant  work  is
required  on  the  physician’s  part  upon
committing  to  such  a  risk.  As  a  practi-
tioner, the first questions you should ask
yourself  are  “Why  start  a  new  line  of
products? Would  my  patients  be  more
likely to adhere to therapeutic regimens
if my name is on the label?”

Upon deciding to initiate a line of prod-
ucts, it is important to be aware that start-
up  costs  vary  by  company.  Some  are
especially adept at facilitating and stream-

lining  the  process.  Shopping  around
among  the  different  cosmetic  manufac-
turing and packaging companies and con-
ducting  one’s  own  cost–benefit  analysis,
factoring in time and ultimate benefits to
one’s  patients  as  important  variables,  is
advisable.  As  a  practitioner  considering
this  business  venture,  one  must  be
prepared with an initial desired volume of
product,  the  ideal  launch  date,  and
ingredients/product types. It is important
to  remember,  though,  that  while  manu-
facturers  will  usually  reassure  customers
regarding the ease of concocting products,
the reality is that they are quite difficult to
formulate.  The  bottom  line  in  this  busi-
ness, nonmedical, decision is that signifi-
cant  research  is  necessary—“look  before
you  leap”—before  entering  into  this
difficult, competitive enterprise.

Cosmetic and 
Drug Regulation

Edmund Weisberg, MS
Leslie Baumann, MD

COSMECEUTICALS: DRUGS 
VERSUS COSMETICS

According to the United States Food and
Drug  Administration  (FDA),  a  personal
care product can be classified as a drug, a
cosmetic, or both. Moisturizers with skin
protection  factor  (SPF)  and  antidandruff
shampoos  are  examples  of  dermatologic
products  classified  as  both  a  drug  and  a
cosmetic.  The  term  “cosmeceutical”  was
introduced approximately 25 years ago by
Albert Kligman, MD, at a meeting of the
Society of Cosmetic Chemists because he
felt  that  a  new  category  of  regulation
should exist.1 Although this topic has been
debated for decades, the category “cosme-
ceuticals”  has  still  not  been  codified  or
officially  recognized.  In  other  words,  it
has no legal meaning. The term, however,
is  increasingly  a  part  of  the  mainstream
vernacular and frequently used to describe
products  that  are  known  to  have  a  bio-
logic action but are regulated as cosmet-
ics  (e.g.,  products  containing  retinol).
Although  it  is  well  known  that  retinol
stimulates retinoic acid receptors resulting
in  biologic  activity,  retinol  is  a  popular
ingredient contained in numerous cosmet-
ics. Companies often list retinol as an inac-
tive ingredient on product labels to avoid
regulatory action by the FDA.

The  stage  for  this  unforeseen  regula-
tory  loophole  in  which  cosmeceuticals
reside  was  set  in  1938  when  the  US
Congress passed a statute known as The
Federal  Food,  Drug,  and  Cosmetic  Act
(FD&C Act), which outlined formal cri-
teria  for  classification  of  drugs  and  cos-
metics.  In  this  document,  cosmetics
were defined as: “... articles intended to be
rubbed,  poured,  sprinkled,  or  sprayed  on,
introduced  into,  or  otherwise  applied  to  the
human body or any part thereof for cleansing,
beautifying,  promoting  attractiveness,  or
altering  the  appearance...”  In  contrast,  a
drug is defined as a substance “intended to
affect the structure and function of the body.”
Based on this definition, the actual intent
of the product and not its actions govern
how  it  is  classified.  This  allows  for  the
classification  of  retinol  as  a  cosmetic

because it is listed as an inactive ingredi-
ent on product labels; therefore, retinol is
not intended to serve a biologic purpose.
As  in  several  other  realms  of  society
during  our  era  of  rapidly  propagating
technology, numerous legal implications
fail to anticipate future developments. In
terms  of  the  debate  over  classifying
products as drugs, cosmetics, or cosme-
ceuticals,  there  are  some  salient  points
to consider. The first is that the current
regulations  discourage  companies  from
publishing  supportive  scientific  clinical
trials  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  their
products. For example, if a manufacturer
establishes in a study that an ingredient
increases  collagen  synthesis,  the  com-
pany  is  proving  that  its  product  affects
the “function of the body.” If they were
then to market or sell that product as a
cosmetic  intended  to  increase  collagen
synthesis,  as  would  be  desirable  in  an
antiaging  product  or  a  wrinkle  cream,
they  would  be  violating  the  1938
statute.  The  only  legal  option  for  the
manufacturer would be, instead, to mar-
ket its product as a drug.

Before  approval  for  marketing  in  the
United States, every new drug must be
clinically tested in accordance with FDA
guidelines  for  a  new  drug  application
(NDA).  The  FDA  process  of  drug
approval  can  take  more  than  10  years
and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Obviously,  the  cosmetic  companies  are
left with compelling incentives to avoid
such long delays and exorbitant costs by
following  the  guidelines  to  keep  their
products classified as cosmetics. In such
cases,  even  though  the  companies  per-
form  extensive  research  on  such  prod-
ucts,  their  findings  are  considered  pro-
prietary  and  remain  unpublished.  This,
too, has several implications. The first is
that  dermatologists  and  other  physi-
cians do not have access to this scientific
evidence  and  are  rendered  poorly
equipped to evaluate the efficacy of the
numerous  and  varied  products  making
it  to  market.  Physicians  are  taught  to
practice  evidence-based  medicine,  but
without  evidence,  have  little  reason  to
believe  that  any  of  these  products  are
efficacious  or  effective.  Consequently,
the  medical  establishment  dismisses
these products as useless when such for-
mulations  may,  in  fact,  offer  potential
benefits  to  patients.  The  second  prob-
lem  is  that  consumers  may  often
become confused by all the sleek, glitzy
marketing.  They  rarely  know  how  to
tell  the  difference  between  a  reputable

company 
scientific
that  conducts 
research  and  a  company  of  charlatans
seeking  to  capitalize  on  consumers’
dreams  of  younger  and  healthier  skin.
With  little  guidance  given  the  medical
community’s lack of information regard-
ing these OTC products, consumers try
products  and  likely  feel  disappointed
with the lack of results. Consumers are
also  left  to  operate  under  the  false
assumption that you get what you pay
for—that  is,  the  more  expensive  the
product, the more likely it is to be effec-
tive. This can lead to a general distrust of
the  entire  cosmetic  dermatology  field.
The  third  problem  with  cosmetic  com-
panies performing internal research and
not  publishing  the  results  for  general
review is the circumvention of the peer
review  process.  Peer  review  has  long
been considered essential to validate the
research findings of scientists. It is diffi-
cult to believe or have confidence in the
results of a study that has not been sub-
jected to the peer review process.

in 

Also beyond the peer review process,
there are individuals outside of compa-
nies that attempt to perform research on
cosmetic products and procedures with-
out  the  concern  for  product  classifica-
tion;  however,  it  is  often  difficult  for
these  individuals  to  raise  the  research
funding necessary to perform such stud-
ies.  There  are  research  grants  available
from  several  companies  that  may  help
these  researchers 
their  efforts,
though.  On  the  other  hand,  one  must
consider  the  dilemma  confronting  the
cosmetic  companies:  if  they  support  a
research study and the product does not
work,  they  lose  money  and  risk  their
credibility  or  reputation.  If  the  product
does  work,  the  company  faces  regula-
tion  of  its  product  as  a  drug  and  the
related time lag to market, or they will
be unable to use the research findings in
their marketing of the product as a cos-
metic. Some of the more savvy compa-
nies fund research of their products, and
inform  dermatologists  of  the  results
with  the  hope  that  the  dermatologists
will,  in  turn,  become  convinced  of  the
product’s efficacy and recommend it to
patients or other physicians. In this way,
the entire marketing problem is avoided
because  the  dermatologist,  rather  than
the company, is promoting the product.
A legal category called cosmeceuticals
that  includes  products  shown  to  have  a
biologic function but not subjected to the
expensive  drug  approval  process  would
be ideal. However, many companies and

individuals  oppose  such  an  enactment
because it would likely lead to the regula-
tion of most cosmetic products. For exam-
ple,  in  Europe,  under  the  European
Economic  Cosmetic  Directive  of  1993,
the  requirements  for  cosmetic  product
labeling  became  formidable  and  com-
plex.2 In contrast, companies in the US do
not have to demonstrate either efficacy or
safety  prior  to  marketing  their  products.
Of course, all reputable companies ensure
the safety of their products before distrib-
uting them; however, astonishingly, they
are technically not required to do so.

What  should  cosmetic  dermatolo-
gists  do  to  protect  patients  and  them-
selves in an atmosphere in which com-
panies are not required to research, or to
release  their  research,  on  the  efficacy
and  safety  of  cosmetic  products?
Fortunately,  many 
individuals  are
beginning  to  independently  investigate
these  products  and  their  claims  and  to
publish  the  findings  in  peer-reviewed
journals.  Poster  presentations  at  meet-
ings  are  also  a  helpful  source  of  infor-
mation. Companies seem more likely to
present their findings in a poster format;
however,  it  is  important  to  remember
that  these  posters  are  often  not  peer
reviewed. Some companies will provide
unpublished  research  data  on  request 
to interested physicians. The Cosmetic
Toiletry  and  Fragrance  Association
(CTFA) publishes a helpful guide called
the  Cosmetic  Ingredient  Review.  It  is
designed  to  review  and  document  the
safety  of  cosmetic  ingredients.  An
expert scientific panel examines world-
wide published and unpublished safety
data  in  an  independent  and  unbiased
manner. Finally, all cosmetic dermatolo-
gists who hope to preserve and enhance
the  integrity  of  the  field  should  insist
that  manufacturers  of  cosmetic  prod-
ucts  and  procedures  supply  well-
controlled published studies to support
their  claims.  If  these  dermatologists
and,  later,  consumers  refuse  to  buy
products  lacking  an  evidence-based
medicine  approach,  the  studies  will
eventually  be  performed  and  certainly
lead  to  exciting  new  developments  in
the field of cosmeceuticals.

SELF-REGULATION: THE 
NATIONAL ADVERTISING 
DIVISION

The National Advertising Division (NAD)
of the Council of Better Business Bureaus
(http://www.nadreview.org/)  is  a  self-
monitoring  society  to  which  companies
can  report  other  companies  for  making

242

false  claims  about  products.  The  NAD
renders a decision, with the intention of
objectively, quickly, and privately reach-
ing a settlement. The goal is to promote
truth  in  advertising  and,  in  the  process,
keep government from getting involved
in the process and avoid costly litigation.
The  US  Federal  Trade  Commission
(FTC)  also  can  play  a  role  and  sanction
companies that lack the data to support
its claims. Of dermatologic interest, the
NAD  recently  recommended  that  Skin
Doctors  Cosmeceuticals  alter  its  claims
“Eyetuck  AntiBag
regarding 
Technology,”  particularly  its  favorable
comparisons  to  plastic  surgery.  The
NAD  deemed  that  it  was  inappropriate
for  manufacturers  of  a  product  that
works only on the skin surface compare,
without  substantiating  evidence,  their
cream/serum  to  plastic  surgery  proce-
dures that penetrate into the skin.3

ORGANIC SKIN CARE

History

(USDA)  approved 

The term “organic” can be traced back to
1940.  J.I.  Rodale,  who  founded  the
Rodale  book  and  magazine  publishing
empire  with  the  modest  publication
Organic  Farming  and  Gardening,  coined
the  expression.4 From  then  through
1992,  when  the  US  Department  of
Agriculture 
the
“organic”  label  and  its  accompanying
standards, organic has mostly applied to
agricultural  foods  and  practices.  Today,
there  are  government-regulated  stan-
dards only for organic food and topical
products, but clothing and even pet food
are  now  available  in  organic  varieties.
Currently, organic milk is far and away
the most popular organic product.5

Organic plants are never grown with
commercial  pesticides  or  hormones,
owing  to  concerns  about  human  health
and  environmental  impact.  Although
research  has  yet  to  prove  that  organics
are  healthier  than  nonorganic  products,
evidence has been uncovered to indicate
why  exposures  to  certain  substances  in
nonorganic  products  could  be  harmful.
For  example,  investigators  found  in  a
recent  study  that  exposure  to  a  com-
pound  derived  from  pesticides  may  be
associated  with  male  infertility  since  it
lowered circulating testosterone levels in
adult  men.6 Other  studies  have  shown
that pesticides in the soil, water, and air
are harmful to wildlife. Environmentally
conscious  consumers  take  this  kind  of
information into account in their product
selections,  and  often  opt  for  certified
organic products when available.

Organic Skin and Body Products

Between 1998 and 2004, the use of natural
and organic skin and body products rose
by  51%  according  to  “Packaged  Facts”
provided on www.MarketResearch.com.
As recently as 2005, there were no rules
regarding the use of terms such as organic
or natural. Consequently, the use of these
labels  has  typically  caused  significant
confusion.  For  example,  prior  to  regula-
tion, manufacturers could call their prod-
uct  organic  even  if  it  was  composed  of
90%  water  (a  so-called  organic  ingredi-
ent), with no other organic active ingredi-
ents. To rectify this misleading situation
(at the request of numerous manufactur-
ers  of  natural  and  organic  topical  prod-
ucts),  the  USDA  enacted  new  organic
standards for skin and body care products
in August 2005. Consumers can now pur-
chase skin, body, and hair products with
the  USDA  Organic  Seal.  A  product  that
contains at least 95% organic ingredients
can be legally labeled as organic. A prod-
uct that contains at least 75% and up to
94% organic ingredients can be labeled as
“made with organic ingredients.”

The Rules of Organic Production

In  organic  farming,  of  food  crops  or
those  intended  for  topical  products,
farmers  eschew  synthetic  pesticides,
hormones,  genetic  modification  of
crops,  and  chemical  products.  Organic
farming also follows traditional agricul-
tural  practices  intended  to  enrich  the
soil, use resources in an environmentally
sound  manner,  and  treat 
livestock
humanely.  Specifically,  a  grower  of
organic  ingredients  must  meet  these
basic criteria in order for the products to
be certified as organic:

1. Abstain from the application of pro-
hibited materials (including synthetic
fertilizers,  pesticides,  and  sewage
sludge)  for  3  years  prior  to  certifica-
tion and then continually throughout
their organic license.

2. Prohibit the use of genetically modi-

fied organisms and irradiation.

3. Employ  positive  soil  building,  con-
servation, manure management, and
crop rotation practices.

4. Avoid contamination during the pro-

cessing of organic products.

5. Keep records of all operations (courtesy
of the Organic Consumers’ Association).

Organic Topical Products

While  there  are  no  long-term  studies
documenting  the  effects  of  using  topi-
cal  organic  products  or  ingredients,

 
 
 
consumers  of  organic  products  are  usu-
ally as interested in what products do not
contain, as in what they do contain. The
organic label assures that the key cleans-
ing  and  conditioning  ingredients  are
derived  from  organically  grown  plant
products,  rather  than  conventionally
grown  plants,  synthetic  chemicals,  or
petroleum by-products. In addition, topi-
cal organic products exclude or minimize
any ingredients that could be considered
potentially  harmful  to  people,  animals,
waterways, or the environment.

The Precautionary Principle

Sometimes  certain 
ingredients  are
excluded  from  products  based  on
research.  In  other  cases,  exclusions  are
based  on  the  “precautionary  principle,”
which  stipulates  that  until  the  cumula-
tive  impacts  and  exposures  to  a  broad
range  of 
ingredients  can  be  fully
assessed, it is best to err on the side of
caution and  limit  use.  For  example,
though many chemical ingredients used
in cosmetics are widely considered safe
for  use,  some  safety  factors  have  not
been fully studied. It is virtually impossi-
ble  to  evaluate  the  cumulative  effects of
repeated  exposures 
from  multiple
sources. This is important because con-
sumers,  especially  women,  use  several
skin, hair, and beauty products per day.
The  ingredients  in  these  products  can
potentially  interact,  or  lead  to  a  higher
combined  rate  of  exposure  to  certain
ingredients  than  is  usually  assessed  by
studying the safety of a single ingredient
in  the  laboratory.  Further,  to  accurately
establish  the  baseline  of  the  chemical
exposures people can safely tolerate, it is
necessary  to  account  for  all chemical
exposures  from  food,  urban  smog,
industrial waste, and other sources.

Obviously,  the  costs  of  testing  for
such exposures are too high for individ-
uals and are not part of routine tests at
this time. Consequently, it is impractical
for each of us to determine our own par-
ticular  health  care  risks.  In  response  to
such  an  uncertainty,  many  consumers
who  choose  organic  foods  and  topical
products  prefer  to  limit  chemical  expo-
sures as a precaution whenever feasible.
People  with  allergies  and  illnesses  may
also choose to be more cautious.

Ingredient Cautions

While  not  all  widely  used  synthetic
ingredients  are  considered  problematic,
certain ones represent a source for spe-
cial concern. For example, the parabens
(alkyl  esters  of  p-hydroxybenzoic  acid)
are  used  as  preservatives  in  many  cos-

metics  as  well  as  skin,  hair,  and  body
care  products,  and  can  sometimes  pro-
voke  allergic  reactions7,8 (see  Chapters
18 and 37). Parabens can be absorbed via
the  skin  and  migrate  into  the  blood-
stream  and  bodily  tissue.  One  contro-
versial study even found high concentra-
tions  of  parabens  in  breast  cancer
tissue.9 Products  containing  parabens
should be avoided by most people who
know they are allergic to parabens. (This
can  be  determined  by  patch  testing.)
There  are  no  cogent  data  to  indicate
that  parabens  pose  a  risk  to  those  not
allergic  to  this  group  of  compounds.
Nevertheless,  many  people  opt  to
abstain  from  using  products  containing
this type of preservative ingredient.

Toluene, which is found in several nail
polish brands, has been associated with
deleterious  effects  on  males  in  utero.
Therefore,  major  companies  such  as
L’Oréal and Revlon as well as manufac-
turers  of  natural  and  organic  products
have  taken  steps  to  eliminate  toluene
from  their  nail  polishes.  Toluene  can
also induce a skin rash, typically on the
eyelids,  in  people  who  use  toluene-
containing nail polishes. There are several
other  ingredients  that  warrant  caution,
but  it  is  important  to  know  that  even
organic  products  can  cause  problems.
For  example,  coconut  oil,  a  popular
organic  ingredient,  can  cause  acne.
Allergies  to  many  essential  oils  and
botanicals can also develop. In addition,
because  companies  were  not  able  to
label  their  products  as  organic  until
recently,  there  have  not  been  sufficient
clinical  research  trials  on  the  organic
products  on  the  market.  In  fact,  it  is
plausible, if not likely, that most of the
American  manufacturers  of  organic
brands  are  just  using  the  label  for  mar-
keting purposes without proof that their
products  are  efficacious.  In  particular,
the  organic  sunscreens  available  in  the
US are remarkably suboptimal.

Natural Ingredients

It  is  important  to  note  that  a  product
that is touted as natural is not necessar-
ily  organic.  The  product  may  contain
aloe, vitamin E, or other natural ingredi-
ents,  but  it  may  also  contain  chemicals
intended  to  act  as  preservatives  or  to
improve its texture. Only products that
are truly organic are legally permitted to
use the organic seal.

Of  course,  problems  or  allergic
responses can be associated with ingre-
dients  that  are  natural,  and/or  organic.
For  instance,  many  natural  and  organic
brands  contain  certain  fragrances  and

essential  oils  that  can  cause  dermatitis.
Oil of bergamot and balsam of Peru are
both  highly  allergenic,  so  even  an
organic  product  containing  them  could
irritate  sensitive  individuals.  Organic
products  that  include  strong  essential
oils such as peppermint or rosemary can
also  irritate  or  inflame  sensitive  skin.
Chamomile, generally considered a gen-
tle  and  soothing  herb,  can  induce  aller-
gies in some people (who may also tend
to  be  allergic  to  wheat).  Furthermore,
conventional  products  as  well  as  some
natural ones contain a “perfume mix” to
mask  their  odor.  Components  of  the
perfume  mix  are  rarely  listed  on  the
product  label  since  each  company  uses
its own proprietary blend. Even a prod-
uct listed as 95% organic could contain a
perfume mix that might provoke allergic
reactions in some people.

Skin Type and Product Choice

Although  patients  may  express  prefer-
ences  among  organic,  natural,  and  con-
ventional  product  options,  such  consid-
erations  should  be  superseded,  from  a
practitioner’s perspective, by identifying
a patient’s skin type and making appro-
priate  product  recommendations.  For
example, an organic body lotion contain-
ing whole soy oil could be suitable for a
patient with nonpigmented skin. But, for
a patient with pigmented skin, that same
product could exacerbate the propensity
to melasma and pigmentation. For such
patients,  opting  for  a  soy  product  with
the  estrogenic  components  removed,
thus  not  considered  organic  because  it
has been altered, is preferable to a natu-
rally occurring soy product. Fractionated
soy, also known as “active soy,” has had
the  estrogenic  components  removed.
Active  soy  is  contained  in  several
Neutrogena  products  and  in  Aveeno’s
Positively  Radiant  line.  As  another
example,  a  patient  with  dry,  wrinkled
skin would benefit from using green tea
formulations,  of  which  several  product
options are organic. However, the Topix
product Replenix™ has a higher level of
green  tea  polyphenols  than  any  of  the
organic  products  currently  on  the  mar-
ket.  In  addition,  a  patient  who  strictly
uses organic products, but who has oily,
wrinkle-prone skin, would benefit from
using retinoids, even though they are not
organic.  There  are  no  organic  products
that have the actions of retinoids.

Is Organic Better?

There is no question that many natural
products  have  proven  benefits  when

243

 
 
 
 
topically applied to the skin. Green tea is
a  good  example  of  a  natural  ingredient
with  demonstrated  benefits.  However,
does it matter whether or not the green
tea is organic? Likely, it is the form and
concentration  of  the  ingredient  that  is
more  important  or  influential  than
whether  it  is  organic.  In  the  case  of
green  tea,  we  know  the  EGCG  form  is
the strongest. When green tea is placed
in  skin  care  products  in  a  high  enough
concentration to be effective, it turns the
product  brown.  It  is  likely  that  organic
products in the near future will improve
and  have  increased  amounts  of  active
ingredients  because  consumers  have
shown that they want this. If a product
contains  the  right  ingredients  for  the
patient’s skin type, and an organic prod-
uct is available with active levels of that
ingredient,  then  organic  is  a  better
option  overall.  Using  organic  products
can  help  the  environment  as  well
because they can prevent the build-up of
parabens  and  other  substances  in  the
environment.  The  farming  methods
used to produce them are better for the
environment and the packaging is often
biodegradable.  Once  the  organic  prod-
uct  manufacturers  perform  trials  show-
ing efficacy of their products, they will
likely be embraced by skin care profes-
sionals and consumers alike.

What About Synthetic Products?

In  many  cases,  it  is  only  the  chemical
ingredients, such as retinoids, that con-
fer  desired  benefits  and  no  analogous
organic  products  are  available.  It  is
important  for  practitioners  to  guide
patients in product selection and explain
to them the benefits of nonorganic prod-
ucts  such  as  retinoids.  A  person  using
retinoids  can  supplement  with  natural
and  organic  products,  thereby  enhanc-
ing  exposure  to  beneficial  ingredients
while limiting the use of synthetic ingre-
dients to only the ones needed. Jurlique
is  a  great  example  of  a  company  that,
while not currently certified as organic,
strives  to  manufacture  a  pure  product
line, especially oriented toward and ben-
eficial  to  people  with  sensitive  skin.
Jurlique comes from Australia, a country
that  has  long  embraced  the  idea  of
organic  or  natural  products.  Aesop,

another  skin  care  line  from  Australia,
has a large following of organic product
customers.  Liz  Earle  is  a  natural  line
from  the  UK.  Clarins  and  Aveeno  have
been  producing  natural  products  for
years.  In  addition,  Origins  now  has  a
large  organic  skin  care  line,  and  Stella
McCartney markets a few such products.

SUMMARY

It is fair to say that products considered
cosmeceuticals  fall  through  the  regula-
tory  loopholes  in  laws  governing  the
testing  and  labeling  of  drugs  and  cos-
metics. In turn, such rules affect the kind
of  information  readily  accessible  to  the
medical establishment that can be used
to  guide  patients.  Whether  one  is  con-
sidering the merits of a well-tested drug
versus an unregulated cosmeceutical, or
an  unregulated  organic  product  versus
an unregulated synthetic one, dermatol-
ogists can best advise their patients with
more, not less or hidden, evidence.

Of  course,  with  the  proper  time  and
attention,  most  patients/consumers  can
find the right blend of products suited to
their  particular  skin  type.  As  a  practi-
tioner, it is best to keep such concerns at
the forefront of your recommendations,
while trying to honor a patient’s stated
preferences.  Now  that  companies  are
allowed  to  label  their  products  as
organic,  these  products  may  become
more sophisticated. In fact, these manu-
facturers may research their products to
establish efficacy and safety. It remains
important,  though,  to  indicate  the
advantages  and  disadvantages  of  any
products that you might recommend. If
a certain ingredient is good for a patient,
and it is in an organic product, it is suit-
able  for  recommendation.  If  a  patient
needs a particular ingredient that cannot
be  found  in  organic  products,  broaden-
ing  the  patient’s  scope  to  include  the
conventional product that will best meet
the  needs  of  their  skin  is  warranted.
Generally, if an ingredient is right for a
patient’s  skin  type  and  it  is  found  in  a
sufficient form and concentration in the
product,  then  selecting  the  natural  or
organic  product  is  perfectly  acceptable.
However,  there  are  not  many  well
researched  naturals  on  the  market  and

there  are  even  fewer,  if  any,  well
researched organic products at this time.
Much  more  nonproprietary  research  is
needed,  particularly  in  the  form  of
randomized controlled trials, to provide
sufficient  evidence  of  the  efficacy  of
organic  products.  Of  course,  if  such
products  impart  a  quantifiable  biologic
action,  the  potential  marketing  outlook
might  significantly  alter  the  manufac-
turer’s  plans.  The  legal  and  business
morass,  which 
patients/
consumers, physicians, and manufactur-
ers,  requires  a  concerted  effort  by
legislators and the business community
to  resolve.  Despite  the  recent  improve-
ment  in  the  law  governing  the  labeling
of  organics,  a  similar  solution  for  the
very broad category of cosemeceuticals
does not appear to be in the offing.

Sunscreens

For  several  years,  dermatologists  have
exhorted  their  patients  to  avoid  or,  at
the very least, severely limit exposure to
the sun since ultraviolet (UV) radiation is
the primary cause of skin cancer, exoge-
nous  skin  aging,  wrinkles,  and  blotchy
pigmentation.1 In spite of these attempts
to  educate  the  public,  the  incidence  of
skin cancer is increasing at a disturbing
rate.  In  2005,  there  were  an  estimated
60,000 melanoma cases diagnosed in the
US. Alarmingly, there are approximately
8000  deaths  in  the  US  related  to  this
most potent and fatal of the skin cancers
per year.2 Cosmetic patients offer a cap-
tive and interested audience that can be
educated  about  the  hazards  of  the  sun
and  the  need  for  corresponding  protec-
tive behavior. Of all the skin care advice
that is doled out to patients, it is likely
that this is the most important, because
proper  protection  from  the  sun  will
make  a  great  difference  in  the  patient’s
future  appearance.  Patients  should  be
advised that if they do not avoid the sun
and  practice  protective  measures,  they
are  wasting  their  money  on  cosmetic
products and procedures.

Obviously, the daily use of sunscreen is
an  important  adjunct  to  skin  protective
behavior. However, because no sunscreen
can  effectively  block  all  parts  of  the  UV
spectrum,  sun  avoidance,  protective
clothing  and  hats,  and  window  shields
can  all  be  utilized  to  lessen  acute  and
cumulative sun exposure. Patients should
be instructed about the proper use of sun-
screen and asked about sunscreen use at
every  visit.  This  constant  nagging  will
help them realize how important it is to
protect  their  skin  from  the  sun.  Even  if
patients claim to use sunscreen and know
about the hazards of the sun, studies have
shown  that  they  still  do  not  get  enough
sun  protection.  In  fact,  it  is  known  that
mothers  provide  more  sun  protection  to
their  children  than  to  themselves,3 and
that sun protection attitudes tend to sub-
side  from  childhood  to  adolescence.4
Even  well-intentioned  sunscreen  users
can  forget  the  rules.  For  example,  one
study  found  that  98%  of  352  family
groups  applied  their  sunscreen  after

before as is suggested for optimal sun pro-
tection.5 This chapter discusses the practi-
cal aspects of sunscreen formulations and
selection, which should enhance the prac-
titioner’s ability to help patients find the
best  sunscreen  protection  for  their  skin
type  and  lifestyle  as  well  as  answer
patients’ numerous product questions.

ULTRAVIOLET A AND B

On  a  typical  summer  day,  UVA  com-
prises  about  96.5%  of  the  UV  radiation
reaching  earth,  leaving  UVB  only  with
the  remaining  3.5%.6 When  compared
with all kinds of light reaching the earth’s
surface, UVA makes up 9.5% (Fig. 29-1).
While UVA is the predominant UV light
reaching  the  surface  of  the  earth,  UVB
exposure  is  more  likely  to  cause  squa-
mous  cell  carcinoma  in  an  experimental
setting.7 This supports the usage of sun-
screens intended to block UVB. The first
sunscreens  that  were  developed  were
designed to prevent erythema (skin red-
dening)  and  sunburning  by  blocking
UVB,  and  did  little  to  block  UVA.  UVA
leads  to  immunosuppression  and  is
thought to play a role in the development
of melanoma.8 Therefore, both UVA and
UVB sunscreens should be used. UV light
exerts its carcinogenic effect on the skin
by inducing mutations in DNA. DNA is
considered a chromophore for UV light.
Although  maximum  UV  absorption  by
DNA  occurs  at  260  nm,  UVB  is  consid-
ered a major source of DNA damage.9 UV
irradiation results in DNA damage by for-
mation of two dimers between adjacent
pyrimidines,  cyclobutane  pyrimidine
dimers  (CPDs),  and  pyrimidine  6  to
4 photoproducts.  Nucleotide  excision

repair (NER) enzymes are responsible for
removal  of  these  carcinogenic  products.
If  not  repaired,  mutations  in  the  DNA
sequence  also  known  as  UV  “signature
mutations” may occur.

UVB  is  blocked  by  glass  and  the
amount of UVB that reaches the earth’s
surface  varies  by  the  time  of  day,  with
maximal  rays  reaching  the  earth  from 
10  AM to  4  PM.  UVA  radiation,  on  the
other  hand,  can  pass  through  glass 
(Fig. 29-2). Its ability to reach the earth’s
surface  remains  more  constant  regard-
less of the time of day or the amount of
cloud  cover  (Fig.  29-3).  UVA  penetrates
deeper  into  the  skin,  contributing  to
cutaneous  wrinkling  and  aging.  UVA
radiation is also known to cause damage
to the dermal layer of the skin (Fig. 29-
4). In a study performed by Lavker et al.,
repeated  exposures  to  suberythemic
doses of UVA resulted in greater epider-
mal  thickness,  in  addition  to  deposition
of lysosomes on elastin fibers, as well as
decreased  Langerhans  cells  and  dermal
inflammatory infiltrates.10 Unfortunately,
the sun protection factor (SPF) primarily
assesses  the  protective  effects  against
UVB  light,  leaving  UVA  out  of  the  pic-
ture.  In  other  words,  if  SPF  45  is  on  a

label,  this  applies  to  UVB  protection
only and gives no information about the
protection against UVA radiation.

SUN PROTECTION FACTOR

The  SPF  represents  the  ability  of  a  sun-
screen  to  delay  sun-induced  skin  ery-
thema, which is a visible sign of damage
mainly  caused  by  UVB  radiation.  SPF  is
defined  technically  as  the  level  of  sun
exposure  needed  to  produce  a  minimal
erythema dose divided by the amount of
energy required to produce the same ery-
thema  on  unprotected  skin.  In  theory,  a
subject that applies an SPF 10 sunscreen on
uncovered  skin  could  stay  in  the  sun 
10 times longer without incurring a visible
skin erythemal reaction. The SPF is deter-
mined  through  testing  on  the  untanned
skin  of  human  volunteers  (generally  the
back or the upper part of the buttocks).

The internationally agreed upon stan-
dard  quantity  of  sunscreen  per  unit  of
skin  surface  (i.e.,  the  sunscreen  thick-
ness)  required  to  measure  the  SPF  in
humans  is  2  mg/cm2 of  skin.11 For  an
adult to apply this amount of sunscreen
to  the  entire  body,  30  mL  of  sunscreen
would be required to obtain that thick-

ness.12 In most cases people do not apply
enough  sunscreen.13 Facial  powders,  for
example,  are  impossible  to  apply  in  an
amount sufficient to equal the 2 mg/cm2
of skin that is used in testing to determine
the  SPF.  The  average  face  is  about  600
cm2;  therefore,  a  person  would  need  to
apply about 1.2 g of facial powder to get
the  SPF  stated  on  the  product’s  label.
Most women apply only about 0.085 g of
powder  at  a  time.  In  other  words,  one
would  have  to  apply  14  times  the
amount  of  powder  normally  used  to  be
sufficiently protected against the sun (Fig.
29-5). Facial SPF lotion applications tend
to  amount  to  about  0.8  g  per  average
application,  as  measured  in  the  primary
author’s  practice.  Therefore,  individuals
would  need  to  use  about  1.5  times  the
amount  of  facial  lotion  they  are  accus-

tomed  to  using  in  order  to  achieve  the
SPF  on  the  label.  In  fact,  a  recent  study
demonstrated  that  most  users  probably
achieve a mean SPF of between 20% and
50%  of  that  expected  from  the  product
label because they do not apply the sun-
screen as thickly as is performed in labo-
ratory  conditions.14 The  key  is  applying
sufficient  amounts  of  sunscreen  evenly
across  a  given  area  to  achieve  the
intended solar protection.

The  notion  of  inadequate  sunscreen
application was also suggested by a study
of European students that found that the
students used approximately one-fifth of
the  recommended  sunscreen  quantity.12
A useful rule-of-thumb is that the protec-
tion most people ultimately obtain from
a sunscreen is equal to about one-third of
the SPF. So applying an SPF-15 sunscreen
at  a  typical  application  thickness  to  the
face provides about five-fold protection,
not  15-fold.15 While  still  counseling
patients  on  the  proper  amount  of  sun-
screen to apply, it is advisable to recom-
mend the highest SPF sunscreen that the
patient  can  tolerate  to  compensate  for
this discrepancy.

In the past, the SPF system was based
mainly on UVB (280–315 nm) exposure,
which is responsible for the immediate
reddening seen on the skin. It is impor-
tant  to  remember  that  UVA-associated
reddening is seen much later and, there-
fore, UVA exposure and dose would not
be accounted for in the current methods
of  measuring  SPF.  UVA  light  is  also
responsible for darkening pigment seen
after  sun  exposure.  Because  of  the
damaging  effects  of  UVA,  there  is  new

research  regarding  the  incorporation  of
UVA (320–400 nm) into the sun protec-
tion  index.  Globally,  there  are  several
UVA rating systems and the FDA is cur-
rently trying to decide which rating sys-
tem  to  make  the  standard  in  the  US.
Because there is no consensus standard
for UVA testing, products in the US do
not provide any UVA coverage informa-
tion  on  the  product  label.  This  is  obvi-
ously a significant problem.

THE FDA AND SUNCREEN

As this textbook went to press, the FDA
was  considering  the  problem  of  UVA
and sunscreen labeling. In August 2007,
the FDA proposed the creation of a new
rating  system  for  UVA  sunscreen  prod-
ucts.16 This system would be based on a
scale of one to four stars, with one star
representing  low  UVA  protection,  two
stars,  medium  protection,  three  stars,
high protection, and four stars, the high-
est UVA protection available in an OTC
sunscreen product. Under this proposal,
a sunscreen product that fails to provide
at least a low level (one star) of protec-
tion would bear a “no UVA protection”
marking on the front label near the SPF
value.  In  addition,  a  warning  would  be
required on labels stating: “UV exposure
from  the  sun  increases  the  risk  of  skin
cancer, premature skin aging, and other
skin damage. It is important to decrease
UV exposure by limiting time in the sun,
wearing protective clothing, and using a

sunscreen.” It is hoped that this warning
will increase awareness that sun avoid-
ance and limiting sun exposure are also
necessary.  This  proposal  has  not  yet
been accepted and the star rating system
was not yet in place when this chapter
was completed. Search www.fda.gov to
find out the current sunscreen rulings.

TESTING TO DETERMINE 
UVA PROTECTION

As  suggested  above,  ascertaining  the
optimal  UVA  rating  method  is  difficult
and  even  contentious.  Each  manufac-
turer believes that the method they use
is the best. L’Oréal developed the persis-
tent pigment darkening (PPD) method,17
while Johnson & Johnson developed the
protection  factor  UVA  (PFA)  method.18
The  PPD  and  PFA  are  very  similar
approaches  in  that  they  both  measure
end-result  tanning.19 The  FDA  has  not
yet  determined  which  UVA  measure-
ment  method  is  best  because  all  meth-
ods  lack  an  endpoint  measure  that  is  a
true  surrogate  marker  for  long  wave-
length (i.e., (cid:3)340 nm) UVA-induced skin
damage  (i.e.,  skin  cancer  or  photoag-
ing).19 The FDA seems to be most seri-
ously considering two methods of UVA
testing:  the  critical  wavelength  method
and  the  PFA  (PA)  method.  The  critical
wavelength was developed in 1994 and
is  an  in  vitro  testing  method.20
It
involves  placing  a  certain  amount  of
sunscreen  on  a  slide  and  exposing  the

slide  to  progressively  higher  wave-
lengths  of  light  starting  at  290  nm,  the
beginning of the UVB range. When 10%
of the incident light passes through the
slide, or the protection provided by the
sunscreen has dropped to 90%, the cor-
responding  wavelength  of 
is
recorded. For sunscreens with SPF 15 or
above,  this  is  a  good  measure  of  UVA
protection.  If  one  is  testing  a  low-SPF
product, below SPF 15, this is thought to
be a suboptimal method.

light 

The PFA (PA) method is similar to the
UVB SPF rating insofar as it is an in vivo
test that measures what is in essence the
tanning effect of  short wavelength UVA
rays (320–350 nm).21 This is widely used
in Europe. However, the PFA (PA) system
measures  an  observed  effect  (tanning),
not  the  biologic  endpoint.  It  is  possible
that the FDA will recommend a combi-
nation of the critical wavelength and PFA
(PA) methods (Tables 29-1 and 29-2 for a
brief summary of the three types of tests
to  ascertain  sunscreen  efficacy  and  for
related non-US standards).

Another approach to measuring UVA
involves  the  quantitative  measurement
of  free  radicals  in  human  skin  induced
by  UV  radiation.22 Reactive  free  radi-
cals  have  been  correlated  with  the
occurrence of skin damage such as can-
cer  and  skin  aging.  The  method  of
measuring  free  radicals  is  known  as
electron  spin  resonance  (ESR)  spec-
troscopy.  This  technique  incorporates
the  radical  trapping  properties  of
nitroxides.  Nitroxides  are  antioxidant

and  anticancer  substances.  In  a  recent
study, the nitroxides TEMPO, PCM, and
PCA were used because of their known
capacity to trap reactive free radicals in
skin  exposed  to  UV  irradiation.  The
effects of UV radiation on the nitroxides
can be measured because they reduce to
hydroxylamines.  The  nitroxide  PCA  is
found  universally  in  skin  and  is  solely
reduced  by  UV-generated  free  radicals
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) mak-
ing  it  possible  to  estimate  the  penetra-
tion  of  UVA  and  UVB  irradiation.  UV
irradiation decreases the PCA intensity,
and this reduction has been shown to be
engendered  mainly  by  UVA  radiation.
Therefore, using ESR, the in vivo detec-
tion  of  UV-generated  free  radicals/ROS
via the reduction of the nitroxide PCA in
human skin should be possible.23

An  additional  method  used  to  assess
UVA radiation damage is comparing the
accumulation  levels  of  p53,  which  is
known to be a very important tumor sup-
pressor gene. Mutations in p53 have been
noted  in  more  than  90%  of  squamous
cell  carcinoma,  50%  of  basal  cell  carci-
noma,  and  60%  of  actinic  keratoses.24
Expression of p53 is used to quantify skin
damage associated with UV-related skin
damage and can be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of sunscreens.

In a recent study, two sunscreens with
identical SPF but varying UVA protection
factors  were  evaluated  using  the  PPD
method.25 The  PPD  is  a  measure  of  the
amount of darkening pigment that is pre-
sent a day or so after sun exposure.24 The
SPF  of  the  sunscreens  was  7,  while  the
UVA  protection  factor  (UVA-PF)  deter-
mined in vivo using the PPD method was
7 for one product and 3 for the other. The
amount of p53 was also measured in skin
exposed  to  UV  radiation.  The  results
showed  that  only  partial  protection  was
afforded by the two sunscreens with iden-
tical SPF, but there was a lower level of p53
in the areas of skin treated with the sun-
screen  of  higher  UVA  protection  factor.
The results portrayed a marked increase in
the  amount  of  p53  in  the  skin  with
increasing  exposure  to  higher  levels  of
UVA  radiation.  These  results  confirmed

that  SPF  based  on  erythemal  reaction
caused  by  UVB  does  not  accurately
predict  the  level  of  protection  conferred
against UVA damage from sun exposure.25

Other Sunscreen Terminology

A  sunscreen  is  considered  water  resis-
tant if the SPF level is determined effec-
tive after 40 minutes of water immersion.
The  testing  procedure  for  these  sun-
screens  is  as  follows:  the  subjects  must
swim  in  an  indoor  pool  for  20  minutes
followed by air drying (not towel drying)
the skin. The subjects are then asked to
swim for another 20 minutes followed by
an air drying period. The water-resistant
sunscreen  SPF  is  then  measured  after
the  total  40  minutes  of  water  contact.26
The FDA requires that the SPF listed on
the label reflect the SPF that is achieved
after  this  water-resistant  testing  rather
than the SPF value present before testing.
Sunscreens  that  are  labeled  very
water  resistant have  been  shown  to
exhibit  an  effective  SPF  after  undergo-
ing  the  following  testing:  the  subjects
swim in an indoor pool for 20 minutes
then air dry for 20 minutes. The proce-
dure is repeated for a total of 80 minutes
of  water  immersion.  If  a  sunscreen
retains  its  protective  integrity  after  four 
20-minute water immersions, it is consid-
ered  very  water  resistant. It  is  impor-
tant to note that the word “waterproof”
is no longer allowed in labeling because it
is misleading. No sunscreen is completely
waterproof.

The  lipophilic  base  of  the  vehicle
used in these “water-resistant” formula-
tions allows the products to adhere well
to the skin, though their typically greasy
feel  is  not  often  welcome  by  users.
Depending on the ingredients used, the
higher SPF formulations tend to be oilier
or more opaque.

SUNSCREEN CLASSIFICATION

The  two  generally  recognized  major
types  of  sunscreen  products  are  chemi-
cal and physical.

Physical Sunscreens

Barrier  sunscreens,  known  more  com-
monly as physical sunscreens, scatter or
reflect UV radiation and are rarely asso-
ciated with allergic reactions. These sun-
screens  block  the  widest  range  of  light
including UV, visible, and infrared spec-
tra, and are recommended for use espe-
cially  when  intense  sun  exposure,  such
as  at  the  beach  or  at  high  altitudes,  is
expected.  Patients  with  sensitive  skin
are  more  likely  to  tolerate  this  type  of
sunscreen,  as  opposed  to  the  chemical
variety.  Titanium  dioxide  (TiO2),  mag-
nesium oxide, iron oxide, and zinc oxide
(ZnO)  are  the  primary  ingredients  in
physical sunscreens. The older formula-
tions require a thick layer of application,
melt in the sun, stain clothing, and can
be  comedogenic.  Some  of  these  agents
are so opaque that they are visible and,
consequently,  often  cosmetically  unac-
ceptable to most people. Some manufac-
turers  have  marketed  opaque  products
in bright colors specifically designed for
use by children.

formulations 

Cosmetically  acceptable  translucent
or colloidal suspensions that consist of
micronized  preparations  of  ZnO  and
TiO2  have  been  recently  developed.
These 
are  popular
because they remain on the skin’s sur-
face and are not systemically absorbed.
This minimizes irritation and sensitiza-
tion,  and  maximizes  their  safety  pro-
file.27
In  fact,  there  have  been  no
reports of contact allergy to these com-
ponents.28 In the early 1990s, microfine
ZnO  became  available.29 Microfine
ZnO  absorbs  appreciably  more  UV
light  in  the  long-wave  UVA  spectrum
from  340  to  380  nm.  The  only  other
sunscreen  ingredient  approved  for  use
in the US that protects against this UVA
is  the  organic  chemical
spectrum 
avobenzone.  Because  avobenzone  is
photolabile  in  UV  light,  its  protective
ability is uncertain.30 Notably, ZnO and
TiO2  are  not  photolabile.  However,
formulations  of
new  photostable 
avobenzone  have  been  developed.
Formulations  containing  micronized
ZnO or TiO2 are the most often recom-
mended  products  for  sensitive  skin
types; however, ZnO or TiO2 products
are  not  interchangeable.  Microfine
TiO2
effectively  attenuates  UVB
(290–320 nm) and UVA2 (320–340 nm);
however,  it  is  less  effective  than  ZnO
in  the  UVA1  range  ((cid:3)340  nm).29
Microfine  ZnO  has  a  particle  size  of
less  than  0.2  μm.  At  this  size,  visible
light  scattering  is  minimized  and  the
particles  appear  transparent  in  thin

is whiter and more difficult to incorpo-
rate  into  transparent  products  than  is
ZnO.

One problem with metal oxides that
contain  physical  sunscreens,  though,  is
that they may produce oxygen free radi-
cals at their surface when irradiated. The
photoreactivity of metal oxides has been
extensively  studied,32 and  it  even  has
been  suggested  that  photoactive  metal
oxides may initiate deleterious events in
the skin. Generally, TiO2 is much more
photoactive  than  ZnO  as  shown  in  a
report  by  Mitchnick  et  al.29 TiO2  has
even  been  shown  to  damage  DNA  in
in vitro studies.33 However,  to  affect
skin,  the  particles  would  have  to  tra-
verse the stratum corneum. Since parti-
cles of microfine ZnO and TiO2 are too
large  to  enter  the  skin,  they  would  not
be  expected  to  be  biologically  active.
Most companies minimize the photore-
activity  of  these  agents  by  coating  the
surface with dimethicone or silicone.34

Chemical Sunscreens

Chemical  sunscreens  are  usually  com-
bined with physical sunscreens or with
each  other  to  form  high-SPF  products
that can be used during times of signifi-
cant sun exposure. However, they have
several drawbacks. Chemical sunscreens
absorb UV radiation. The absorbed radi-
ation must then be dissipated as either
heat  or  light,  or  else  be  used  in  some
chemical  reaction.  This  may  result  in
the creation of ROS or photoproducts
that  can  attack  other  chemicals  in  a
formulation;  if  absorbed,  such  by-
products can attack the skin itself (see
Chapters. 6 and 34 for a discussion of
antioxidants).
and 
free 
However, in most cases, the radiation
simply  is  emitted  again  at  a  longer
wavelength  and  does  not  lead  to  free
radical formation.29

radicals 

Chemical  sunscreens  are  composed
of synthetically prepared organic chemi-
cals that can be broadly labeled as UVB-
or  UVA-absorbing  substances.  These
colorless,  often-odorless  agents  prevent
UV  radiation  from  penetrating  the  epi-
dermis by acting as filters as they absorb
and reflect UV radiation. Many chemical
sunscreens have been reported to cause
allergic or photoallergic reactions in sus-
ceptible  patients.  Another  drawback  of
chemical  sunscreens  is  that  some  of
them are unstable when exposed to UV
radiation.  For  example,  a  15-minute
exposure  of  solar-simulated  light  has

been  reported  to  destroy  36%  of
avobenzone.30 Moreover,  as  avoben-
zone  degrades,  other  organic  sunscreen
agents in the formula may be destroyed
as well.35 Some chemical sunscreens are
systemically  absorbed  and  levels  have
been  demonstrated  in  the  urine  of
humans using the product.36 For this rea-
son, chemical sunscreens should not be
used in children younger than 2 years of
age. Several popular chemical sunscreen
additives will be discussed below.

STABILITY OF SUNSCREENS

One  of  the  main  requirements  in  the
development  of  a  sunscreen  is  that  the
product  be  photostable,  or  maintain  its
intended  protection  for  a  limited  time
before inevitable breakdown caused by
UV  exposure.  Photostability  is  charac-
terized  by  the  effect  of  light  on  the
degradation  of  certain  substances.  The
photostability  of  a  sunscreen  depends
on varying factors such as which filters
were used, as well as the types of UV fil-
ters,  solvents,  and  vehicles.  A  common
means  of  measuring  and  quantifying
photostability  is  through  the  comet
assay test. This test is a method to mea-
sure DNA damage in cells. It is catego-
rized  as  a  gel-electrophoresis-based
test.37 Recent studies have attempted to
evaluate  the  stability  of  sunscreens.
Avobenzone,  a  common  filter  in  sun-
screens and potent absorber of UV radi-
ation, has been shown to be increasingly
photolabile. For this reason, new photo-
stable  forms  of  avobenzone  (such  as
Helioplex™)  have  been  developed.
Recent  findings  have  suggested  adding
Tinosorb,  a  UVA  filter,  in  conjunction
with avobenzone to improve the photo-
stability of avobenzone. When Tinosorb
is  combined  with  avobenzone,  it  pre-
vents  avobenzone’s  degradation  caused
by  UV  irradiation.38 In  another  study,
four different UV filters commonly used
in  SPF-15  sunscreens  were  compared
using  HPLC  analysis  and  spectropho-
tometry.  The  following  were  the
UV filter  combinations  tested:  octyl
methoxycinnamate  (OMC),  benzophe-
none-3  (BP-3),  and  octyl  salicylate  (OS)
(formulation  1);  OMC,  avobenzone
(AVB),  and  4-methylbenzilidene  cam-
phor  (MBC)  (formulation  2);  OMC, 
BP-3, and octocrylene (OC) (formulation
3);  and  OMC,  AVB,  and  OC  (formula-
tion 4). The results showed that all four
of the UV filter combinations portrayed
varying  photostability.  The  best  results
were  shown  by  formulation  3  (OMC,
BP-3, and OC), followed by, in descend-

ing  order,  formulations  4,  1,  and  2.  In
addition, OC improved the photostabil-
ity  of  OMC,  AVB,  and  BP-3.39 For  this
reason, many sunscreens on the market
contain  combinations  of  sunscreen
ingredients.

A novel formulation called UV Pearls
utilizes  microencapsulation  technology
to entrap organic sunscreen chemicals in
a sol-gel silica glass. This makes it possi-
ble  to  incorporate  hydrophobic  UV  fil-
ters into the aqueous phase of sunscreen
formulations.  The  “encapsulation  of
sunscreens”  allows  physical  separation
between  organic  and  inorganic  ingredi-
ents. This results in an increased overall
photostability in sunscreen products. In
addition,  it  is  believed  that  encapsulat-
ing UV filters will significantly decrease
the  dermal  uptake  of  these  UV  filters,
and  reduce  the  amount  of  free  radicals
generated by keeping the organic filters
on  the  top  layers  of  the  skin.  This
reduces penetration into the deeper lay-
ers and decreases the risk of contact der-
matitis.40

UVB-ABSORBING SUNSCREEN
FORMULATIONS
Para-aminobenzoic Acid

Poorly  soluble  in  water,  thus  only  suit-
able  for  alcohol-containing  vehicles,
para-aminobenzoic  acid  (PABA)  was
one  of  the  first  commonly  used  sun-
screen  ingredients.  PABA  established  a
reputation for inducing a stinging sensa-
tion in the skin and staining both cotton
and synthetic fabrics. Later formulations
were labeled as “PABA-free” because of
the widespread negative publicity asso-
ciated with such characteristics. To skirt
this  problem,  manufacturers  developed
PABA derivatives, which are water solu-
ble and unable to penetrate the stratum
corneum.  Octyl  diethyl  PABA  or  padi-
mate O, a potent absorber of UVB, is the
main derivative used. Photoallergic reac-
tions have been reported in association
with the use of PABA and its derivatives.

Cinnamates

This category of compounds has largely
replaced  PABA  derivatives.  Octyl  meth-
oxycinnamate 
(OMC),  with  a  UV
absorption  maximum  of  310  nm,  is  the
most  commonly  used.  Several  cosmetic
products, including makeup foundations,
lipsticks,  and  leave-in  hair  conditioners,
contain this compound. The Freeze 24/7
Iceshield uses the UV Pearl technology in
which OMC is encapsulated in sol-gel sil-
ica glass and formulated into a wash-on

sunscreen.  In  other  words,  it  is  a
cleanser  that  deposits  sunscreen  on  the
skin  with  cleansing.  This  is  a  great
option  for  people  who  do  not  like  the
greasy feel of sunscreen (men in particu-
lar are reputed to complain about greasy
formulations).  Because  cinnamates  are
poorly  soluble  in  water,  they  do  not
wash  off  with  cleansing  and  are  often
included  in  water-resistant  and  very
water-resistant  sunscreens.  Although
allergy  to  these  agents  is  unusual,  pho-
toallergic  reactions  have  been  reported
in association with the use of formu-
lations  containing  cinnamates.  It  is
believed  that  coating  the  particles  with
the sol-gel silica glass may decrease the
incidence  of  allergy.  Patients  allergic  to
this  compound  may  also  be  allergic  to
fragrances  and  flavorings  that  contain
cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamon oil.41

Salicylates

With  a  UV  absorption  maximum  at 
310 nm, salicylates are used to augment
the UVB protection in sunscreens. Octyl
salicylate  (2-ethyl  hexyl  salicylate)  and
homosalate  (homomenthyl  salicylate)
are the most popular salicylates in sun-
screens.  These  compounds  are  stable,
nonsensitizing,  and  water  insoluble,
yielding  high  substantivity.  The  chemi-
cal properties of salicylates render them
highly  suitable  for  combination  with
other chemical sunscreen agents, such as
benzophenones,  in  cosmetic  formula-
tions. In fact, salicylates are used only in
combination  with  other  UV  filters
because they are too weak to be the sole
active  filtering  ingredients.  Contact
allergy to salicylates is very rare.

Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid

In  contrast  to  other  UV  filters  that  are
soluble in the oil phase, phenylbenzimi-
dazole sulfonic acid (PSA) is water solu-
ble. As a result, this ingredient imparts a
less oily feel to sunscreen formulations.
Unfortunately, PSA, like salicylates, is a
selective  UVB  filter  and  allows  almost
full  UVA  transmission.  This  compound
may  be  more  suitable  in  combination
with other filters.

UVA-ABSORBING SUNSCREEN
FORMULATIONS

Benzophenones

The  absorption  range  for  benzophe-
nones is predominantly in the UVA por-
tion  of  the  light  spectrum  between  320
and 350 nm. Oxybenzone, which is fre-

250

quently  used  to  augment  UVB  protec-
tion, has an absorption maximum at 326
nm.  This  compound  is  also  one  of  the
best  blockers  of  UVA2  (shorter  UVA
in  the  US.
wavelengths)  available 
Oxybenzone  is  a  very  common  sun-
screen  component  and  it  is  estimated
that 20% to 30% of sunscreens contain
this  chemical.42 Unfortunately,  oxyben-
zone is currently the most common sun-
screen  agent  to  cause  photoallergic
contact  dermatitis.41 One  case  report
described  a  22-year-old  female  that
developed anaphylaxis after widespread
application  of  a  sunscreen  containing
oxybenzone.42 The  allergy  to  oxyben-
zone was later confirmed by skin testing.
Further, it has been well established that
systemic  absorption  of  oxybenzone
occurs.  A  study  in  the  Lancet demon-
strated  in  humans  that  application  of
substantial  amounts  of  a  sunscreen
containing  oxybenzone  resulted  in  the
oxybenzone  being  absorbed  and  subse-
quently excreted in urine.36 Oxybenzone
has low acute toxicity in animal studies
yet  little  is  known  about  its  chronic
toxicity  and  disposition  after  topical
application in humans.43 For this reason,
sunscreens containing this agent are not
recommended for use in children.

Menthyl Anthranilate

The absorption peak for this compound
is at 340 nm. Consequently, it is a weak
UVB  filter,  but  offers  effective  UVA2
protection.  Menthyl  anthranilate  is
less  widely  used  than  benzophenone
because it is less effective.

Parsol 1789

Parsol  1789 
(avobenzone  or  butyl
methoxydibenzoylmethane)  has  an
absorption maximum at 355 nm and pro-
vides  superior  UVA  protection.  This
ingredient was approved by the FDA in
the late 1990s. Parsol 1789 has also been
frequently reported to cause photoaller-
gic  dermatitis.41 Avobenzone  is  one  of
the most commonly used UVA-blocking
ingredients. The initial formulations had
significant 
stability.
However,  since  2007  several  stabilized
forms of avobenzone have become com-
mercially  available,  including  Helioplex
by  Neutrogena  and  Active  Photobarrier
Complex  by  Aveeno.  Sunscreens  made
before 2007 should be discarded.

issues  with 

Mexoryl®
The  FDA  finally  approved  a  new  UVA
filter  after  years  of  negotiations.  This
sunscreen  agent  is  known  as  Mexoryl

and is owned by L’Oréal. It is found in
many  L’Oréal  brands 
including  La
Roche-Posay,  Vichy,  and  Lancôme.
Mexoryl  SX  is  the  formulation  that  is
approved  in  the  US.  It  does  not  block
UV light quite as effectively as Mexoryl
XL, which is not yet available in the US.
However, Mexoryl SX is a water-soluble
formulation  and  therefore  feels  less
greasy on the skin and more suitable for
everyday use. On the contrary, Mexoryl
XL is oil soluble, making it more suitable
as a water-resistant sunscreen. Mexoryl
SX is an organic filter that is found to be
very  effective  against  shorter  UVA
wavelengths.  These  short  UVA  waves
ranging  from  320  to  340  nm  constitute
95%  of  UV  radiation  that  reaches  the
earth. Mexoryl can be added in combi-
nation with other UV filters. In contrast
to  avobenzone,  Mexoryl  is  photostable
and does not degrade when exposed to
UV radiation.44

Sunscreen Combinations

Many  sunscreen  formulations  contain
combinations of active sunscreen ingre-
dients  to  enhance  protection  and  alter
the aesthetics of the product. The FDA
regulates  which  sunscreens  can  be
combined with others; this is because of
the  recognition  that  certain  sunscreen
ingredients  are  incompatible  and  can
actually lower the SPF rating of a prod-
uct  when  combined.26 Combinations
are  employed  to  achieve  a  higher  SPF
using  a  lower  concentration  of  sun-
screen ingredients.

ROLE OF ANTIOXIDANTS
IN SUNSCREENS

Just  as  the  body  has  its  own  immune
defense  system,  the  skin  has  its  own
antioxidant defense system. This system
protects  the  skin  from  UV-induced
oxidative  damage.  Excess  UV  radiation
can prevent free radicals in the skin from
being  absorbed  by  this  natural  defense
mechanism, thus leading to cancer, wrin-
kling, and aging. This excess of UV expo-
sure  calls  for  the  induction  and  use  of
antioxidant  enzymes.24 Such  enzymes
act as UV filters and capture the free rad-
icals  before  they  cause  damage.  Retinyl
esters,  a  storage  form  of  vitamin  A,
have  been  found  to  absorb  UV  radia-
tion  with  a  maximum  at  325  nm.45
Along  with  enzymatic  antioxidants,
nonenzymatic forms exist as well. GSH,
alpha-tocopherol,  and  beta-carotene  are
among a few of the nonenzymatic antiox-
idants  administered.  Some  examples  of

 
 
 
enzymatic forms include catalase, super-
oxide dismutase, and GSH peroxidase.24
Antioxidants can be administered in oral
or  topical  forms  (see  Chapter  34).  Oral
forms  tend  to  be  more  beneficial
because  they  do  not  wear  away  from
skin  by  daily  rubbing  and  washing.  In
addition,  topical  antioxidants  may  not
have  the  capacity  to  be  properly
absorbed  into  the  skin.  Consequently,
topical antioxidants do not protect well
against  UV  radiation  alone  and  have  a
low  SPF.  Thus,  antioxidants  should  be
used in conjunction with a sunscreen to
increase their efficiency.

One antioxidant of note is Polypodium
leucotomos,  a  botanically-derived  com-
pound that belongs to the genus of ferns.
It has been used in the treatment of vari-
ous  inflammatory  disorders  as  well  as
vitiligo. In a study by González et al., the
in  vivo  properties  of  polypodium  were
identified.  In  the  study,  21  volunteers
were divided into two groups. One group
was  treated  with  orally  ingested  pso-
ralens (8-MOP or 5-MOP) and the other
group was not treated. These volunteers
were then exposed to solar radiation. The
following clinical parameters were evalu-
ated:  immediate  pigment  darkening
(IPD),  minimal  erythema  dose  (MED),
minimal melanogenic dose (MMD), and
minimal  phototoxic  dose  (MPD)  before
and after topical or oral administration of
polypodium  leucotomos.46 The  results
showed that polypodium was photopro-
tective after topical application as well as
oral administration.

ADVERSE EFFECTS 
OF SUNSCREENS

Current data suggest that adverse effects
induced  by  chemical  sunscreens  have
included no systemic problems but have
included local cutaneous manifestations
such  as  contact  dermatitis,  irritant  and
allergic, as well as phototoxic and pho-
toallergic  reactions.  In  fact,  sunscreens
are one of the most common causative
agents of photoallergic contact dermati-
tis  in  the  US.47 These  agents  can  also
cause  contact  dermatitis  in  the  absence
of sun exposure. PABA, benzophenones,
cinnamates,  and  methoxydibenzoyl-
methane are the most common ingredi-
ents  in  chemical  sunscreens  implicated
in  provoking  allergic  contact  dermati-
tis48–50 (see  Chapter  18).  Physical  sun-
screens  containing  TiO2 and  ZnO  have
never  been  reported  to  cause  contact
allergy  and,  therefore,  are  suitable  for
patients  with  a  history  of  sunscreen
hypersensitivity.28

It is important to remember that addi-
tives  to  sunscreen  preparations  such  as
fragrances  and  preservatives  are  also
likely  to  cause  allergic  reactions  in  sus-
ceptible  patients  (see  Chapters  36  and
37).  One  study  of  603  patients  found
that although 19% of the subjects com-
plained  of  some  sort  of  reaction  to  the
sunscreen,  none  of  the  subjects  were
allergic  to  the  sunscreen  active  ingredi-
ents,  as  revealed  by  patch  testing.  In
fact,  only  10%  of  the  reactions  were
found  to  have  an  allergic  component.
The majority of adverse responses were
consistent  with  an  irritant  reaction.51
Sunscreen vehicles, particularly the oily
preparations,  can  also  exacerbate  acne,
as can acute UV exposure. Research sug-
gests  that  it  is  not  the  individual  sun-
screen oil but the vehicle that can cause
the development of comedones.52,53

The  misconception  that  sunscreen
offers total protection is insidious insofar
as  it  leads  some  consumers  to  increase
the  length  or  frequency  of  their  sun
exposure.  No  sunscreen  completely
blocks the sun. In fact, the FDA no longer
allows the term “sunblock” to be used on
product labeling. Because the protection
offered by many sunscreens is limited to
UVB  (280–315  nm)  and  short-wave-
length  UVA2  (320–340  nm),  the  use  of
such  products  may  paradoxically
increase  exposure  to  long-wavelength
UVA1  (340–400  nm).54 UVA  (320–400
nm) comprises the major portion of UV
radiation  reaching  the  surface  of  the
earth and has been shown to play a role
in  skin  carcinogenesis,  photodermatosis
induction,  and  other  sun-induced  skin
diseases. UVA has been recognized as a
component in the genesis of solar elasto-
sis,55 and studies by Lavker10 and Lowe56
provide evidence that repeated exposure
to an artificial source of long-wavelength
UVA  produces  morphologic  changes  in
human skin indicative of photodamage.
In  a  study  by  Bissonnette  et  al.,  the
pigmentation  darkening  method  was
to  compare  UVA  protection
used 
afforded  by  six  commercially  available
sunscreens with an SPF of 20 or more.57
These products claimed on their labels to
offer  UVA  and  UVB  protection.
Researchers  found  that  the  sunscreens
that  allowed  the  lowest  amount  of  pig-
ment  darkening,  and  therefore  the  best
UVA  coverage,  contained  Parsol  1789.
Interestingly,  the  sunscreens  that  pro-
tected the least against UVA-induced pig-
mentation were the sunscreens with the
second and third highest SPF (45 and 50),
showing  that  selecting  a  high  SPF  sun-
screen cannot be used as the only guide
to compare UVA protection afforded by

lized  avobenzone  formulations  and
Mexoryl have recently entered the mar-
ket,  greatly  increasing  the  UVA  protec-
tion of easily available sunscreens.

VITAMIN D AND SUNSCREEN

as 

and 

lung 

Another  current  controversy  that  is  far
from being resolved pertains to vitamin
D  and  sun  exposure.  Vitamin  D  is
important  for  the  prevention  of  many
types  of  cancers.  Recent  studies  have
shown that vitamin D prevents cancers
prostate.58
such 
Unfortunately,  the  best  method  for
obtaining  a  healthy  and  proper  dose  of
vitamin D is through the sun (Fig. 29-6).
Supplements, pills, and fortified milk do
not  contain  the  proper  recommended
dose  of  daily  vitamin  D.  Lying  on  a
sunny beach for 20 minutes can generate
10,000 IU of vitamin D while a glass of
milk  produces  only  100  IU.59 Thus
emerges  the  controversy,  as  the  best
way  of  obtaining  vitamin  D  is  through
sun  exposure,  yet  too  much  sun  expo-
sure  is  known  to  cause  skin  cancer.  In
addition,  sunscreens  block  most  UVB
light.  It  is  UVB  that  promotes  the  syn-
thesis of vitamin D. UVB is the source of
sunburns and suntans as well. Research
on this topic is ongoing and a final con-
clusion  has  not  yet  been  reached.  One
study  showed  that  there  is  no  correla-
tion between skin cancer prevention and
vitamin D. In this study, 165 melanoma
patients  and  209  controls  were  ques-
tioned  using  a  food-frequency  ques-
tionnaire.  Investigators  controlled  for
age,  hair  color,  and  family  history,  and
the results showed no evidence of vita-
min  D  conferring  protection  against
melanoma or reducing its risk.60 A paral-
lel study implied that sunscreen applica-
tion  does  not  decrease  vitamin  D 
levels.61 On the other hand, some studies
have  found  that  sunscreen  application
does in fact decrease vitamin D levels. In
one particular study, 20 long-term users
of sunscreen with PABA were tested and
were  found  to  have  significantly  lower
vitamin  D  serum  levels  as  compared  to
normal controls.62 Although this contro-
versy  is  far  from  being  settled,  most
researchers recommend a few minutes in
the  sun  without  sunscreen  but  advise
against sun exposure for any significant
elapsed amount of time.

Intermittent Use of Sunscreen

Many  sunscreen  users  may  have  the
misconception that intermittent use of a

251

 
cally  prefer  creams.  These  products
make ideal sunscreens because the most
effective active ingredients can be intro-
duced  into  the  lipid  phase  of  an  emul-
sion. Products with a higher SPF contain
more  sunscreen  oil  and  impart  a  heavy
and greasy feel.64,65

high-SPF product is as effective as daily
use of a lower-SPF product. For instance,
dermatologists are in a position to hear
anecdotally that a distinct subset of sun-
screen  users  consider  themselves  regu-
lar  users  of  sunscreen,  every  time  they
go  to  the  beach.  One  study  demon-
strated that sunscreens must be applied
properly,  regularly,  and  in  appropriate
amounts  to  be  optimally  effective  in
preventing  UV-induced  skin  damage.
The  findings  suggest  that  missing  an
application of sunscreen, even a potent
one,  can  have  negative  consequences
for  the  skin,  with  regular  use  of  an 
SPF-15  sunscreen  revealed  to  be  more
effective  than  intermittent  use  of  a
higher-SPF  product  in  protecting  the
skin.63 Therefore,  patients  should  be
advised  to  use  sunscreen  on  a  daily
basis,  even  when  not  planning  to  go
into the sun. This will help protect them
from the UVA rays transmitted indoors
through  glass,  and  from  unanticipated
sun exposures.

There  are  so  many  different  product
formulations  on  the  market  that  an
appropriate  sunscreen  should  be  avail-
able  for  every  patient,  though  in  some
cases,  identifying  one  may  take  some
effort.  At  this  point,  given  the  amassed
body of research, the benefits of wearing
daily sunscreen, at least on exposed areas
such as the face, appear to outweigh any
risks.

VEHICLE FOR DELIVERY OF
ACTIVE INGREDIENTS

Sunscreen product efficacy and aesthetic
results  are  influenced  by  the  manufac-
turer’s choice of vehicle to deliver active
ingredients. Emulsions, known as lotions
and creams, are the most common sun-
screen vehicles. Of course, several kinds
of  formulations  are  commercially  avail-
able and are typically selected according
to individual preferences.

Cleansers

One  cleanser  called  IceShield  by  Freeze
24/7  is  available  on  the  market  that
claims to deposit sunscreen on the skin.
This is a great option to use in those who
do not like the feel of greasy sunscreens.
However, at this time, there is a dearth
of data as to how effective these wash-
on sunscreens are. While more evidence
is  needed,  it  is  presently  recommended
that  this  product  be  combined  with  a
more reliable sunscreen when prolonged
sun exposure is anticipated.

Lotions and Creams

For  people  with  normal  to  oily  skin,
lotions  tend  to  be  more  preferable
because  lotions  have  lower  viscosity,
spread  more  easily,  and  are  less  greasy.
Combination  skin  is  also  amenable  to
lotions, but patients with dry skin typi-

The  only  advantage  to  oils  is  that  they
spread  easily.  Unfortunately,  they  also
spread thinly on the skin rendering less
sun  protection.  Consumers  tend  not  to
like  oils  because  of  the  greasy,  messy
feel on the skin.

Gels

Male  patients  and  those  with  oily  skin
tend  to  prefer  gels.  For  people  that  are
preparing to exercise while wearing sun-
screen, water-based gels are appropriate
because  alcohol-based  gels  can  cause
burning and stinging of the eyes.

Sprays

Sprays have become popular in the last
few years, especially for use in children.
Sprays are a good option for tending to
large areas of the body. One must take
care to ensure that all exposed body sur-
faces are covered.

Sticks

Lipid-soluble  sunscreen  ingredients  are
contained in sticks. Waxes and petrola-
tum  are  added  to  thicken  the  formula-
tions.  Sticks  are  effective  in  protecting
narrow and prominent areas such as the
lips, ears, nose, and around the eyes. For
use during exercise and water activities,
sticks are superior to other formulations
because they last longer and do not have
the tendency to melt, which can irritate
the eyes.

PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF 
MAKEUP AND OTHER SKIN  
CARE PRODUCTS

Sunscreen  ingredients  are  now  com-
monly  found  in  many  makeup  founda-
tions.  Most  facial  foundations  provide
some sun protection as a result of ingre-
dients  such  as  TiO2  and  the  pigments
used to color the product. TiO2 is added
specifically to augment the SPF of some
of  these  products,  but  it  does  result  in 
a  foundation  that  is  more  opaque.
Consequently,  chemical  sunscreens  are
more  often  added  to  impart  protection.
Not every sunscreen ingredient is suitable

 
 
 
the  measurement  of  UPF.69 Because
clothing is not subject to the wide varia-
tion or inconsistency of sunscreen appli-
cation,  a  fabric  really  does  provide  the
level  of  sun  protection  that  its  UPF
suggests.15 Further,  it  is  believed  that
approximately 90% of summer clothes
have  a  UPF  higher  than  10  and  offer
protection equal to that of sunscreens of
SPF  30  or  higher;  the  UPF  of  approxi-
mately  80%  of  such  clothing  exceeds 
a  reading  of  15,  and  offers  nearly
complete  protection  under  normal  sun
exposure patterns.70,71

from 

Washing clothes appears to strengthen
the  UPF.  It  is  well  known  that  cotton
clothes  shrink 
the  washing
process.  Therefore,  it  is  reasonable  to
infer  that  the  spaces,  also  known  as
“pores,”  between  a  fabric’s  threads
shrink from washing. In fact, Welsh and
Diffey demonstrated such a capacity in
their  study  on  the  effects  of  fabric
shrinkage  (from  laundry  with  water
alone and detergent alone) on UPF mea-
surement.72 The  relative  size  of  these
“pores” plays a significant role in limit-
ing  UV  radiation  transmission  through
clothing.73 Wang  et  al.  compiled  fabric
porosity  data  that  demonstrated  a
reduction  in  the  total  area  of  “pores”
between threads or yarns in fabrics laun-
dered  in  various  methods.74 They  con-
cluded that the reduction of “pore” size
after  washing  was  responsible  for  the
observed increase in UPF measurements
and  the  ensuing  decrease  in  UV  trans-
mission through the fabric.

UPF  can  be  further  increased  by
washing  fabrics  with  detergents  that
contain UV-absorbing agents. Tinosorb,
the  UV-absorber  used  in  the  study  by
Wang et al., has a stilbene disulfonic acid
triazine  backbone  that,  when  added  to
laundry,  enables  the  chemical  to  vigor-
ously bind to cotton fabric.74 The result
is  a  reduction  in  UV  transmission
through  absorption  of  UV  energy  onto
the  ring  structures  of  the  compound.
The study results showed that the UPF
increased  significantly  after  multiple
washings  with  detergent  and  UV
absorber,  though  there  was  no  notice-
able change in the whiteness or texture
of  the  fabric.  More  UVA  was  transmit-
ted  through  the  fabrics  than  UVB,
according to the authors.

While  clothing  obviously  plays  an
integral  role  in  protecting  skin  exposed
to  the  sun,  hats  are  also  useful  apparel
adjuncts. Wearing a broad-brimmed hat
can provide an SPF of about 5.75 Hats can
also  add  additional  protection  to  the
coverage that sunglasses provide by cut-
ting down on the angles of sun exposure
(Fig. 29-7).

Window Shields

UVA  rays  are  able  to  penetrate  glass,
while  UVB  rays  are  not.  Because  UVB
rays  are  the  ones  that  cause  initial  red-
dening, a large amount of UVA exposure
can go unnoticed. For patients with pho-
tosensitive skin disorders and those who
want  to  go  one  step  further  to  prevent

for  inclusion  in  makeup  foundations,
however. For example, Parsol effectively
blocks  UVA,  but  is  inactivated  upon
exposure  to  iron  oxide  and  other  pig-
ments  used  in  makeup  foundations.  In
addition, as stated above, the SPF on the
label  of  a  sunscreen  powder  and  facial
foundation is not an accurate reflection of
how much sun protection these products
offer. This is because the average person
applies much less sunscreen product than
is used in FDA testing.13

Within  the  last  few  years,  manufac-
turers have produced hair care products,
notably  shampoos  and  conditioners,
that contain sunscreen ingredients. Such
ingredients  are  probably  rinsed  away
and  rendered  ineffective  because  many
sunscreen ingredients are water soluble
and many of the hair care products are
intended  to  be  rinsed  out.  Although
there are no data establishing their effec-
tiveness, leave-in hair care products are
more likely to provide some protection
to the hair shaft. The FDA has not rec-
ognized any of these products as having
protective  effects  against  the  sun.  Until
proper studies have been completed and
data  made  available,  including  SPF-
labeling,  one  should  not  rely  on  these
products.  The  best  recommendation  is
to wear a hat to prevent sun damage to
the hair.

Insect Repellent and Sunscreen
Combinations

study 

by  Murphy 

A  study  by  Montemarano  et  al.  found
that insect repellent interferes with sun-
screen  efficacy.66 However,  a  subse-
and
quent 
Montemarano  disputed  this  finding,
showing  that  insect  repellent  has  the
same  efficacy  even  when  sunscreen  is
applied with it.67 At this time, it is advis-
able  to  apply  these  products  separately
until further information is available.

Sun Protection with Clothing

The UV Protection Factor (UPF) is a use-
ful  protection  measurement  guideline
for  clothing  similar  to  the  SPF  that  is
used  for  sunscreens.68 The  most  com-
mon,  in  vitro,  method  of  ascertaining
the UPF of clothing involves the use of a
UV radiation source and a photodetec-
tor  to  record  the  intensity  of  the  UV
before  and  after  passing  through  the
fabric. The UPF is simply the ratio of the
two measurements. The clothing indus-
try has largely accepted, and embraced
in some cases, the concepts of sun pro-
tection  provided  by  clothing  and  the
UPF. There is even a British standard for

(cid:2) FIGURE  29-7 In  addition  to  sunscreen, sunglasses, broad-brimmed  hats, and  sun-protective
clothing should be worn when exposed to sunlight for any signiﬁcant length of time.

UVA  exposure,  window  shields  are
available  that  block  UVA  rays.  The
Llumar  UV  Shield  is  recommended  by
the  Skin  Cancer  Foundation  because  it
has been shown to block 99.9% of the
UVA  radiation  in  the  range  of  320  to 
380 nm. These shields can be placed on
car,  boat,  and  house  windows  to
decrease UVA exposure.

Chemoprevention of Photodamage

Chemoprevention  is  another  potential
option  for  protection  against  sunlight-
related skin disorders.76 Chemoprevention
refers to the prevention of disease through
dietary  manipulation  or  pharmacologic
intervention. Among the agents that have
been identified as having potential chemo-
preventive  activities 
in  humans  are
retinoids77 and low-fat diets.78 In addition,
a  polyphenolic  fraction  isolated  from
green  tea  has  been  shown  to  exhibit
multiple  chemopreventive  activities  in
animal models and in in vitro systems79–81
(see Chapter 8). Investigations are ongoing
regarding  the  potential  chemopreventive
properties of several other botanicals and
nutritional components.

SUMMARY

There  are  numerous  sunscreen  choices
on  the  market.  It  is  important  to  help
patients find the sunscreen that is most
suitable for their needs and skin type to
increase the likelihood of compliance to
a  daily  sunscreen  regimen.  It  is  even
more  important  to  emphasize  that  the
daily use of sunscreen is not the first-line
defense  against  the  ravages  of  the  sun
and that sunscreen use does not indem-
nify a person from photodamage or give
one license to stay out longer because of
a coating of sunscreen. The daily use of
sunscreens  is  an  important  ingredient,
though, in the continuing effort to keep
the skin looking young and healthy.

of retinol.4 Twelve years later, retinol was
successfully synthesized and soon became
commercially  available.  Since  that time,
the  retinoid  field  has  proliferated  with
compounds, now numbering more than
2500  products.5 In  fact,  many  generic
forms of tretinoin are currently available
in  the  United  States  and  retinoids  are
even  combined  with  medications  such
as  antibiotics,  as  in  Ziana,  and  hydro-
quinone,  as  in  Tri-Luma.  Initially,  a
retinoid was defined as a compound the
structure and action of which resembled
the  parent  compound  retinol.  Through
the  last  several  decades,  chemists  have
made extensive modifications to the nat-
urally-occurring  molecule  that  have
resulted in the development of three gen-
erations of retinoids (Fig. 30-1). The lat-
est retinoids bear little structural resem-
blance  to  retinol  but  still  qualify  as

Retinoids

Leslie Baumann, MD
Sogol Saghari, MD

Retinoids  are  a  family  of  compounds
derived from vitamin A that includes beta-
carotene  and  other  carotenoids,  retinol,
tretinoin,  tazarotene,  and  adapalene.  For
many years, retinoids have been used top-
ically and systemically for the treatment of
dermatologic  diseases,  particularly  acne.
The potential benefits of retinoids for the
treatment  and  prevention  of  photoaging
have also been explored through the last
two  decades.  This  research  has  led  to  a
greater  understanding  of  the  etiology  of
skin  aging.  Concurrent  but  unrelated
research  has  also  recently  demonstrated
that doses of ultraviolet (UV) light too low
to  cause  visible  skin  reddening  are  still
capable  of  activating  the  enzymatic
machinery that leads to photoaging.1

The  first  anecdotal  evidence  that
retinoids  could  improve  aged  skin  was
seen in female patients being treated for
acne.  These  patients  reported  that  their
skin felt smoother and less wrinkled after
treatment.2 This  observation  was  fol-
lowed by a clinical trial that showed that
patients  treated  with  tretinoin  demon-
strated improvement of sunlight-induced
epidermal  atrophy,  dysplasia,  keratosis,
and dyspigmentation.3 A plethora of clin-
ical  trials  have  confirmed  such  early
observations. The data were submitted to
the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration
(FDA),  which  later  approved  tretinoin
(brand  name  Renova™)  for  use  against
photodamage.  Although  there  are  many
different  topical  retinoids  on  the  market
today that are also useful against photo-
damage, Renova and Avage are the only
topical  agents  approved  specifically  for
this  purpose.  Retinol,  the  metabolic  pre-
cursor of tretinoin, is often added to over-
the-counter (OTC) cosmetic formulations
that  are  touted  as  “antiwrinkle”  creams.
This  chapter  will  focus  on  the  antiaging
activity  of  topical  retinoids.  It  should  be
noted, though, that oral retinoids are also
being used to treat photodamage.

MECHANISM OF ACTION 

Chemical Structure

256

In 1931, the Nobel Prize was awarded to
Karrer et al. for determining the structure

(cid:2) FIGURE  30-1 Chemical  structures  of  the
three generations of retinoids. Addition of aromatic
rings  has  made  third-generation  retinoids  more
stable and more speciﬁc for certain receptors.

retinoids  because  they  can  exert  their
biologic action through the same nuclear
receptors modulated by the active natural
metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid.

In 

Retinoic acid is a lipid-soluble mole-
cule known to affect cell growth, differ-
entiation,  homeostasis,  apoptosis,  and
embryonic  development. 
fact,
retinoids elicit their effects at the mole-
cular level by regulating gene transcrip-
tion and affecting activities such as cel-
lular  differentiation  and  proliferation
(Fig.  30-2 for  the  mechanism  of  action
of  retinoids  in  acne).  These  agents  can
act  directly,  by  inducing  transcription
from genes with promoter regions that
contain  retinoid  response  elements  or
indirectly by inhibiting the transcription
of certain genes.6 Three domains within
the  retinoic  acid  molecule  govern  its
biologic  activity:  an  acidic  function  at
one extreme and a lipophilic domain at
the other, linked by a group that deter-
mines their relative spatial orientation.7
Synthetic retinoids also require an acidic
function pointing away from a lipophilic
portion  for  receptor  affinity  and  tran-
scription. The successive generations of
retinoids  have  resulted  from  modifica-
tion  of  the  retinoic  acid  skeleton  with
structural  rigidification,  through  addi-
tion of aromatic rings in place of the vul-
nerable  double  bonds  found  in  retinoic
acid.  This  makes  the  third-generation
retinoids  more  photostable  when
compared  to  the  first-  and  second-
generation molecules; some compounds
within this family have displayed signif-
icantly reduced irritation potential.8

Retinoid Receptors

Retinoid-binding proteins were first dis-
covered in the 1970s.9 In 1987, the dis-
covery  of  retinoic  acid  receptors  led  to
the  realization  that  tretinoin 
is  a 
hormone.10,11 Since  that  time,  much
research  has  been  performed  to  deter-
mine  the  exact  roles  of  these  binding
proteins  and  receptors.  The  biologic
effects  of  retinoic  acid  are  now  known
to  be  mediated  by  several  biologic  sys-
tems:  binding  proteins  such  as  cellular
retinoic  acid  binding  proteins  I  and  II
(CRABP I and II); cellular retinol binding
protein  (CRBP)2;  and  nuclear  receptors
that are divided into two categories, the
retinoic  acid  receptors  (RARs)  and  the
retinoid  X  receptors  (RXRs).12 All  of
these nuclear receptors are members of a
large superfamily called nuclear hormone
superfamily receptors, which includes the

receptors for vitamin D, estradiol, gluco-
corticoids, and thyroid hormone.13

The  retinoic  acid  receptor  family  is
composed  of  two  types  of  receptors,
the RARs and the RXRs. The RARs and
the  RXRs  are  divided  into  (cid:7),  (cid:8),  and  (cid:9)
subtypes. The RAR(cid:7), RAR(cid:8), and RAR(cid:9)
genes  have  been  localized  to  chromo-
somes 17q21, 3p24, and 12q13, respec-
tively, and the RXR(cid:7), RXR(cid:8), and RXR(cid:9)
genes  have  been  mapped  to  chromo-
somes  9q34.3,  6p21.3,  and  1q22-23,
respectively.14 These receptors are able
to  regulate  gene  expression  in  two
ways:  (1)  they  induce  gene  expression
by  binding  to  specific  DNA  sequences
known  as  retinoic  acid  responsive  ele-
ments (RAREs), or (2) they inhibit gene
expression  by  downregulating  the
actions  of  other  transcription  factors
(such as AP-1 and NF-IL6). All the (cid:7), (cid:8),
and  (cid:9) subtypes  exhibit  distinct  affini-
ties for retinoic acid and show a charac-
teristic tissue distribution. For example,
epidermis  is  a  privileged  tissue  for  the
expression  of  RAR(cid:9) and  RXR(cid:7),  the
major isoforms of their respective fam-
ilies  in  this  tissue,  whereas  RAR(cid:7) is
ubiquitous.  In  the  skin,  RAR(cid:8) is  pri-
marily  found  in  the  dermis,  and  it  is
also  found  in  other  body  tissues.7
Ninety percent of the RARs in the epi-
dermis  and  cultured  keratinocytes  are

RAR(cid:9), which is the receptor associated
with terminal differentiation; therefore,
this  receptor  is  the  target  of  the
retinoids used in dermatology.15

The interactions of the retinoid recep-
tors among themselves and other recep-
tors of the nuclear hormone superfamily
are  complex.  RARs  are  known  to  het-
erodimerize with RXR in order to inter-
act with their RAREs and mediate clas-
sic  retinoid  activity  and  toxicity.  RXRs,
however,  are  more  promiscuous,  het-
erodimerizing with several other mem-
bers of the steroid receptor superfamily
including  peroxisome  proliferator-acti-
vated  receptors  (PPAR),  vitamin  D
receptors,  thyroid  hormone  receptors,
and a number of orphan receptors, such
as  LXR,  PXR,  and  FXR.16 The  interac-
tions  of  these  receptors  are  being  stud-
ied intensively; however, more research
is necessary to fully delineate the mech-
anisms of action of retinoid agents.

RETINOIDS AS ANTIAGING
AGENTS

Photodamage and Matrix
Metalloproteinases

Although tretinoin has been approved for
many years for the treatment of photoag-
ing, evidence suggests that it also plays a

role in the prevention of aging. This can be
linked to inhibitory effects of retinoids on
damaging  metalloproteinases.  UVB
exposure  dramatically  upregulates  the
production of several collagen-degrading
enzymes  known  as  matrix  metallopro-
teinases 
(see  Chapter  6).
Activation of MMP genes results in pro-
duction  of  collagenase,  gelatinase,  and
stromelysin, which have been shown to
fully  degrade  skin  collagen17 (Box  30-1).
Fisher  et  al.  demonstrated  that  applica-
tion of tretinoin inhibits the induction of
all three of these harmful MMPs.1

(MMPs) 

In  addition  to  increasing  levels  of
destructive enzymes such as collagenase,
UV  exposure  has  also  been  shown  to
decrease collagen production. Fisher et al.
demonstrated that expression of collagen
types  I  and  III  is  substantially  reduced
within 24 hours after a single UV expo-
sure.18 Pretreatment of the skin with all-
trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin) was shown
to inhibit this loss of procollagen synthe-
sis.  Therefore,  pretreatment  of  the  skin
with topical retinoids, when used consis-
tently, is likely to be beneficial in prevent-
ing as well as treating photodamage.19

Beneﬁts

Retinoids  have  shown  benefits  in  the
treatment  of  acne  (see  Chapter  15),

257

 
BOX 30-1

Two transciption factors, c-Jun and c-Fos, must combine to produce activator protein-1 (AP-1). AP-1

is able to activate the MMP genes resulting in production of collagenase, gelatinase, and
stromelysin. All-trans-retinoic acid blocks the UV-induced increase in c-Jun protein. Although high
levels of c-Jun mRNA are still present, signifying that the c-Jun gene has been activated, the lev-
els of c-Jun protein are decreased. Topical retinoic acid likely acts to reduce UV induction of c-Jun
protein by stimulating its breakdown through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway19 (Fig. 30-3).

psoriasis,  ichthyosis,  keratoderma,  and
several other diseases. In fact, there are
more than 125 distinct dermatologic dis-
orders  for  which  there  is  credible  evi-
dence  of  retinoid  efficacy.5 Multiple
studies  have  examined  the  use  of
retinoids  for  the  prevention  and  treat-
ment  of  photoaging.  The  first  of  these
clinical trials, using tretinoin, to demon-
strate  clinical  improvement  of  pho-
toaged skin were published in 1986 and
1988.3,20 Since then, many other studies
and  much  clinical  experience  have
shown  similar  results.  In  one  random-
ized  single-center  study,  100  subjects
were  divided  into  three  treatment
groups.21 One  group  was  treated  with
0.1%  tretinoin,  another  with  0.025%
tretinoin, and the last group with vehicle
cream.  Treatment  with  either  0.1%  or
0.025% tretinoin resulted in statistically
significant  improvement  of  photoaged
skin compared with vehicle treatment.

The  histologically  observed  changes
with  the  use  of  retinoids  include  aboli-
tion  of  cellular  atypia,  increased  com-
pacting  of  the  stratum  corneum,  less
clumping of melanin in basal cells, and a
correction  of  polarity  of  keratinocytes,
with  more  orderly  differentiation  as
cells  move  upward.  The  ultrastructural

changes  seen  with  retinoid  use  include
evidence  of  hyperproliferation  of  ker-
atinocytes  (e.g.,  larger  nuclei,  increased
ribosomes,  etc.)  and  a  reduction  in  the
size of melanosomes.

As described in Chapter 6, changes in
collagen and the ratio of collagen I to col-
lagen  III  have  been  found  to  be  impor-
tant in the photoaging process. Retinoids
have  been  shown  to  increase  collagen
synthesis  in  photoaged  individuals.22 In
addition to preventing the breakdown of
collagen  as  described  above,  topical
application  of  tretinoin  0.1%  to  photo-
damaged skin partially restores levels of
collagen type I. An increase in anchoring
fibrils  (collagen  VII)  is  also  seen  after
application of tretinoin 0.1%.22

Side Effects

Side  effects  from  retinoid  use  occur
when  the  product  binds  undesired
receptor  subtypes  not  involved  in  the
expected  biologic  cascade.  The  more
specific  the  binding  pattern  a  retinoid
exhibits,  the  fewer  side  effects  it  will
elicit.  The  newer  generation  retinoids
destined for dermatologic use have been
designed to reduce side effects by mak-
that  bind  more 
ing  compounds 

selectively  to  the  RAR(cid:9) receptor  sub-
type.  However,  with  these  improved
molecules,  the  side  effects  from  topi-
cally applied retinoids still persist, likely
linked to intrinsic RAR(cid:9) activation.

The most common side effects of top-
ical retinoids are skin irritation, desqua-
mation,  and  redness  (Fig.  30-4).  The
increased  desquamation  and  resultant
flaking  of  the  skin  correspond  with
increased proliferation of keratinocytes,
as  indicated  by  a  greater  number  of
mitotic figures and enhanced expression
of differentiation markers.23 These find-
ings seem to be related to the type and
dose  of  the  retinoid  and  usually  occur
within 2 to 4 days of beginning topical
treatment.24 New  studies  have  sug-
gested that patients may achieve maxi-
mum  clinical  improvement  of  pho-
toaged skin without developing retinoid
dermatitis. In other words, the irritation
produced  by  retinoids  is  separate  from
the  photoaging  benefits  of  retinoids.
This  is  demonstrated  in  the  study  that
compared  two  different  strengths  of
tretinoin  (0.1%  and  0.025%).  Although
both  strengths  were  equally  efficacious
in  the  treatment  of  photoaging,  the
degree  of  irritation  differed  markedly
between  the  two  treatment  groups,
with  the  0.1%  tretinoin-treated  group
exhibiting  approximately  a  three-fold
greater  incidence  of  irritation  than  the
0.025%  tretinoin-treated  group.21 This
irritation seems to be receptor mediated
as  implied  by  evidence  that  the  topical
application  of  tretinoin  to  the  skin  of
transgenic  mice  deficient  in  RARs  does
not  result  in  any  apparent  epidermal
hyperplasia  or  desquamation.25 This
suggests that the development of newer
retinoids  with  specific  receptor  and
pharmacokinetic  profiles  and  relevant
dosing may lead to a lower incidence of
irritation, flaking, and desquamation.

Erythema is another side effect of top-
ical retinoids, one that elicits noncompli-
ance  from  patients.  This  symptom  is
caused  by  a  different  mechanism  that
appears  not  to  be  receptor  mediated.26
Patients with rosacea and naturally pink
skin tend to be particularly disturbed by
this  side  effect.  Using  the  techniques
described in Table 30-1 may decrease the
incidence of all types of skin irritation. A
study  performed  in  the  late  1990s  sug-
gested  that  after  a  48-week  regimen  of
once-daily  0.05%  tretinoin  emollient
cream, the benefits of tretinoin could be
sustained by using the treatment only 3
times  weekly  for  an  additional  24
weeks.27 The tretinoin should be used at
least  3 times  a  week,  however,  because
the  same  study  showed  that  once-

 
 
 
increase  cell  proliferation,  this  leads  to  a
decrease in ceramide biosynthesis (at least
in  the  short  term).  This  decrease  in
ceramides, a vital component of the water
barrier  of  the  stratum  corneum,  may
partly  explain  the  xerosis  seen  with
retinoid use30 (see Chapter 11).

The  side  effects  commonly  seen  in
patients  who  have  been  started  on
retinoids  can  usually  be  lessened  by
directing  the  patient  to  apply  small
amounts of the retinoids at less frequent
intervals.  The  lowest  available  dose
should  be  started  initially.  A  topical
retinol  can  be  used  first.  Once  the
patient  is  consistently  applying  the
retinol nightly, the strength of the retinol
can  be  increased.  Once  the  maximal
retinol strength is reached, the patient
can  be  seamlessly  switched  to  a
prescription  retinoid.  Alternately,  a
patient  can  be  started  on  Tri-Luma,
which  is  a  combination  of  hydro-
quinone,  tretinoin,  and  a  mild  steroid.
The  mild  steroid  prevents  irritation
while the hydroquinone hastens the res-
olution  of  solar 
thereby
increasing patient satisfaction and com-
pliance. Whether retinol, Tri-Luma, or a
less irritating retinoid such as Differin is
chosen  to  start  therapy,  in  individuals
with sensitive skin the frequency of use
can  be  slowly  ratcheted  up  as  the
patient’s  tolerance  increases.  Once  the
patient is using the lowest strength of a
particular  retinoid  every  night  for  3
months  without  redness  and  peeling,
the  strength  of  the  retinoid  can  be

These symptoms usually improve with time.

weekly treatment with tretinoin was less
in  sustaining  the  clinical
effective 
improvement  achieved  by  the  initial
treatment  regimen  of  tretinoin  once
daily. The same study also demonstrated
reversal  of  the  beneficial  effects  of
tretinoin treatment after discontinuation
of  therapy  for  24  weeks.  This  indicates
that  patients  must  continue  tretinoin
therapy at least 3 times a week to main-
tain clinical improvement.

Dry skin is also a common complaint of
patients  treated  with  retinoids.  The  flak-
ing  that  patients  experience  when  using
retinoids often leads them to believe that
their  skin  is  dry,  although  the  observed
flaking is caused by a different mechanism
than  those  leading  to  dry  skin.  The  dry
skin noted by retinoid users is likely due in
part to an increase in transepidermal water
loss  (TEWL),  which  accompanies  topical
retinoid use. The increase in TEWL is an
effect typical of topically applied retinoids
and is thought to be associated with a per-
turbation  of  the  stratum  corneum  water
barrier  function.28,29 Although  retinoids

AM: Use cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen as directed by your skin care specialist.
PM:

1. Cleanse face.
2. Apply antiaging, acne, or rosacea treatment product.
3. Mix pea size of retinoid product with a pea size of moisturizer. Apply to face. Do this again to

neck and chest.

Notes:

1. Use retinoid every third night for the ﬁrst 2 weeks.
2. If you have no redness, increase to every other night for 2 weeks.
3. If you have no redness, increase to every night.
4. Once you have used it every night for 3 months, ask your physician to give you the next 

strongest formulation.

5. You may only be able to use the product on your neck twice a week. The neck is more sensi-

tive than the face.

6. Do not apply a moisturizer with glycolic acid or salicylic acid at the same time that you apply
the retinoid. If you use these products, apply them and wait 30 minutes before applying the
retinoid. Glycolic acid and salicylic cleansers are ﬁne to use.

7. Do not use facial scrubs, microdermabrasion, or at-home chemical peels unless these are

prescribed by your skin care specialist.

8. Stop retinoid products 1 week before facial waxing to avoid skin burning from the wax.

increased  to  the  next  level.  In  the  pri-
mary author’s experience, patients who
are given this regimen along with careful
instructions  on  how  to  apply  the
retinoids  display  increased  compliance
as  well  as  benefits  from  the  topical
retinoids.  Table  30-1  lists  the  instruc-
tions  that  should  be  given  to  patients
who are beginning retinoids for the first
time. It is important not to begin other
irritating agents at the same time that a
retinoid is started, such as facial scrubs,
chemical  peels,  or  microdermabrasion.
These  can  be  added  later  once  the
retinoid is sufficiently tolerated. However,
many  dermatologists  have  observed
that patients who have been on hydroxy
acids for extended periods before begin-
ning retinoids may exhibit less irritation
from the retinoids. The reason for this is
currently  unclear.  However, 
is
believed that the hydroxy acids enhance
the function of the skin barrier, leading
to less absorption of the retinoids. Using
barrier repair moisturizers in addition to
the  retinoids  can  be  very  helpful  to
increase  tolerability  (see  Chapters  11
and 32).

Teratogenicity

It is well established that teratogenicity
is a significant risk associated with the
use  of  retinoids,  especially  via  oral
administration.  The  advisability  of
topical retinoid use by women of child-
bearing  age  has  been  the  subject  of
debate because of the potential risk of
systemic absorption. As a general rule,
great  care  should  be  taken  when  pre-
scribing  these  drugs  to  women  of
childbearing  age,  and  should  be
restricted  to  those  drugs  for  which  a
high  safety  margin  has  been  clinically
demonstrated  (e.g.,  in  the  courses  of
treatment  for  psoriasis  or  acne).  It  is
recommended  to  have  pregnant  and
breastfeeding patients cease using top-
ical retinoids, although there are multi-
ple studies that show no effect of some
topical  retinoids  when  used  during
pregnancy.  For  example,  in  one  con-
trolled 
in  which  0.025%
tretinoin  gel  was  applied  daily  to  the
face, neck, and upper part of the chest
for 14 days, fluctuations in plasma lev-
els of endogenous retinoids were lower
than  those  of  diurnal  and  nutritional 
factors.31 Another study demonstrated
no  significant  increase  in  the  rate  of
fetal  malformation  in  a  large  group  of
patients  treated  with  topical  tretinoin
during the first trimester of pregnancy,
as compared with those who were not
exposed to the drug.32

Many patients and physicians have wor-
ried that use of topical tretinoin may lead
to  increased  photosensitivity  because
the daily use of tretinoin causes the stra-
tum  corneum  to  become  thinner  and
more  compact.  This  concern  has  been
due,  at  least  partially,  to  the  fact  that
early  tretinoin  users  were  warned  to
apply the product only at night. The pre-
caution  stemmed  from  the  product’s
poor stability when exposed to UV light,
though, not to any reported photosensi-
tivity  provocation.  In  fact,  it  has  now
been  established  that  there 
is  no
decrease  of  the  minimal  erythema  dose
for human skin that has been pretreated
with topical tretinoin and irradiated with
UV light of a defined energy. This shows
that retinoids possess neither phototoxic
nor photosensitizing activity.1

AVAILABLE TYPES OF
TOPICAL RETINOIDS

All  retinoids  affect  RAR  receptors,  but
which RAR receptor subtype they affect
may vary (Table 30-2). RAR(cid:9) and RXR(cid:7)
are located in the epidermis while RAR(cid:8)
is  found  in  the  dermis.  Although  topi-
cally  applied  retinoids  seem  similar
upon  cursory  inspection,  they  actually
have very important differences that are
beyond the scope of this chapter.

First Generation
TRETINOIN Tretinoin, the natural retinoid
all-trans-retinoic acid, is a first-generation
retinoid and was the first available topical
retinoid,  initially  marketed  as  Retin-A.
Once 
the  photoaging  benefits  of
tretinoin were described, a new formula-
tion, Renova, was approved by the FDA
and marketed for the treatment of pho-
todamage. Although the other retinoids
are also beneficial in treating photodam-
age,  Renova  is  currently  the  only
retinoid  approved  specifically  for  this
purpose.  Tretinoin  is  a  nonselective
retinoid that activates all RAR pathways
((cid:7), (cid:8), and (cid:9)) directly and RXR pathways

indirectly  through  conversion  of  all-
trans-retinoic  acid  to  9-cis-retinoic  acid
(the  natural  ligand  for  RXRs).33 Other
brands  of  tretinoin,  such  as  Avita,  are
now available, as are generic forms.

Given its availability as a generic drug,
tretinoin  is  currently  found  in  several
products.  Notably,  two  combination
products  have  been  introduced  to  the
market.  Ziana  is  a  medication  that  con-
tains  tretinoin  0.025%  and  clindamycin
1.2%. It is used at night in patients with
acne. This product is ideal for use in adult
acne sufferers who can also benefit from
an antiaging component in their skin reg-
imen.  Tri-Luma  combines  tretinoin,
hydroquinone, and a mild steroid. It has
shown  utility  in  pigmentary  disorders
such as melasma and as a first-line ther-
apy for photoaging (Chapter 33).

RETINOL Retinol, also known as vitamin
A, is a first-generation retinoid as well. It
must be converted to retinaldehyde and
then to all-trans-retinoic acid by a dedi-
cated  metabolic  machinery  within  the
keratinocytes  to  become  active  in  the
epidermis,  thus  displaying  much  lower
activity than tretinoin.34 Although it is a
precursor to retinoic acid, retinol is clas-
sified  as  a  cosmetic  rather  than  a  drug;
therefore, it is found in many OTC for-
mulations.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that
because  cosmetic  companies  cannot
claim that their retinol products exert a
biologic  action,  retinol  is  listed  on  all
cosmetic products as an inactive ingredi-
ent. This regulatory quirk, in addition to
the fact that early forms of retinol were
very unstable and exhibited a brief shelf
life, has led many to believe that retinol
has  minimal,  if  any,  biologic  activity.
Moreover, homeopathic doses of retinol
and  its  esters  are  often  listed  on  cos-
metic labels, adding to the poor reputa-
tion  of  retinol,  while  retinol  has  been
shown  to  have  significant  biologic
action and efficacy at the proper doses.
Although  no  large  multicenter  trials
have  been  performed  to  evaluate  the
efficacy  of  retinol,  there  is  much  ongo-
ing  research  evaluating  the  biologic
effects  of  this  product.  A  recent  study

demonstrated that retinol improves the
appearance of wrinkles in sun-protected
areas.35 Despite  evidence  that  retinol
binds RARs, albeit weakly, and can give
rise  to  tretinoin,  its  use  is  not  as  fre-
quently 
clinical 
associated  with 
erythema,36 and  multiple  studies  have
shown  it  to  be  less  irritating  than
tretinoin.  Although  retinol  is  approxi-
mately 20 times less potent than retinoic
acid, unoccluded retinol exhibits greater
penetration  when  compared  to  unoc-
cluded  retinoic  acid.  Retinol  at  0.25%
may  be  a  useful  retinoid-like  treatment
for  application  without  occlusion
because it does not irritate the skin, but
does  induce  cellular  and  molecular
changes similar to those observed with
application of 0.025% retinoic acid.37 A
separate study showed that 1.6% retinol
induced  significant  epidermal  thicken-
ing  and  other  skin  changes  similar  to
those  produced  by  retinoic  acid  but
irritation.36
without  measurable 
However,  much  higher  concentrations
of retinol than retinoic acid were needed
to achieve similar results. New products
with  high  concentrations  of  retinol  are
entering  the  physician-dispensed  mar-
ket.  It  will  be  interesting  to  see  how
these perform as compared to the tradi-
tional prescribed retinoids.

The  application  of  retinol  produces
histologic and molecular alterations that
are very similar to those seen after appli-
cation  of  retinoic  acid.  However,  appli-
cation  of  topical  retinol  results  in
extremely 
levels  of
low  systemic 
retinoic acid. This observation provides
evidence  that  topical  retinol  has  a  sub-
stantial margin of safety with respect to
the potential for systemic absorption.36
Although  retinol  may  be  an  effica-
cious  OTC  option  for  patients,  it  is
important  for  patients  to  understand
that  not  all  retinol-containing  products
are  equal.  Retinol  must  be  manufac-
tured,  formulated,  and  packaged  prop-
erly  to  avoid  oxidation  and  loss  of
potency.  Also,  the  amount  of  retinol  in
the product must be high enough to be
effective.  Unfortunately,  manufacturers
do  not  list  the  concentration  of  retinol
on product packages; therefore, it is dif-
ficult  for  consumers  to  make  an
informed purchase. Another obstacle in
this  area  is  the  inclusion  of  ineffective
esters.  Myriad  cosmeceutical  products
contain  such  compounds,  particularly
retinyl palmitate, which is topically inef-
fective.5 Given  the  dizzying  array  of
products  available,  it  is  important  to
note  that  some  brands  are  properly
manufactured  and  packaged,  such  as
RoC  Retinol  Correxion,  Neutrogena

Healthy Skin, and Philosophy Help Me.
These recommended products are pack-
aged in light-proof aluminum tubes and
contain an adequate amount of retinol.

Second Generation
ADAPALENE  (DIFFERIN) Adapalene  is  a
third-generation  retinoid  approved  for
the  treatment  of  acne.  It  has  selective
affinity only for RAR(cid:9) and RAR(cid:9) recep-
tors  and  does  not  interact  with  any  of
the  RXR  subtypes.38 The  drug  was
intentionally  designed  for  increased
receptor specificity in order to maximize
the beneficial effects, and for mitigation
of  the  unwanted  effects  usually  seen
with the topical application of retinoids.
In  fact,  adapalene  has  been  demon-
strated to be less irritating than tretinoin
in several studies.7 Moreover, it has been
shown  to  possess  a  comfortable  safety
margin  with  regard  to  teratogenicity,
and is the only synthetic retinoid with-
out the X-classification (signifying a ter-
atogenic  compound).  Pharmacologic
and preclinical studies of adapalene have
revealed  the  drug  to  exhibit  excellent
follicular  penetration,39 comedolytic
activity,40
anti-inflammatory 
properties.41 In  addition,  adapalene  is
more  chemically  stable  than  tretinoin
and  does  not  break  down  in  the  pres-
ence of light, as does tretinoin.42 Differin
is the only available formulation of ada-
palene.  It  is  available  in  a  0.1%  and  a
0.3% form.

and 

TAZAROTENE  (TAZORAC/ZORAC) In  1997,
the  FDA  approved  tazarotene  for  the
treatment  of  both  facial  acne  vulgaris
and  plaque  psoriasis.  It  is  currently
available in 0.1% and 0.05% gels and in
0.1%  and  0.05%  creams.  Tazarotene
activates  the  gene  expression  of  RAR(cid:8)
and  RAR(cid:9),  but  does  not  interact  with
any of the RXR subtypes.6 Tazarotene,
like other retinoids, has been shown to
be  effective  against  photoaging.  One
small  double-blind  placebo-controlled
trial compared the effects of tazarotene
0.1% gel on the forearm to the effects of
vehicle  alone  for  a  12-week  period.43
Not surprisingly, tazarotene was associ-
ated with improvement in some of the
signs of photodamage, such as reduced
skin  roughness  and  fine  wrinkling,  at
the  end  of  the  study  period.  Beneficial
histologic  changes  characteristic  of
retinoid  treatment  occurred  in  the  epi-
dermis  and  stratum  corneum.  There  is
clinical evidence that tazarotene is well
tolerated by acne patients, but there are
conflicting data on this subject in the lit-
erature.  Specifically,  a  split-face  study

demonstrated  that  the  tolerability  of
tazarotene 0.1% gel is clinically compa-
rable  to  that  of  tretinoin  0.1%  gel
microsphere, tretinoin 0.025% gel, and
adapalene 0.1% gel,44 while tazarotene
has  otherwise  been  shown  to  display
significantly higher irritation than other
retinoids,  justifying  every-other-day
regimens  to  improve  patient  compli-
ance.  The  efficacy  of  every-other-day
tazarotene  0.1%  gel  was  examined  in
acne  patients  and  was  found  to  offer
comparable  efficacy  to  once-daily  ada-
palene 0.1% gel.45

AGENTS THAT BIND RXR

RXRs are important in controlling apop-
tosis.  9-cis-retinoic  acid  (Pan-Retin),
which is currently approved by the FDA
for  the  treatment  of  Kaposi’s  sarcoma,
binds the RXR (cid:7), (cid:8), and (cid:9) receptors. Its
use in acne and photoaging has not yet
been  studied.  Targretin  gel  is  another
RXR  selective  retinoid.  Targretin
selectively binds all three RXRs, (cid:7), (cid:8),
and  (cid:9),  and  is  now  being  reviewed  in
trials  for  psoriasis.  It  can  repress  AP-1
function, though not as well as retinoids
such  as  retinoic  acid  or  9-cis-retinoic
acid  (Personal  communication.  Reid
Bissonnette,  PhD.  Nuclear  Receptor
Discovery  Department  of  Ligand
Pharmacuticals). The use of RXR ligands
in  cancer  treatments  implies  that  these
drugs  may  have  utility  in  preventing
some  of  the  benign  neoplasms  seen  in
aging  skin;  however,  this  has  not  yet
been studied.

SUMMARY 

Retinoids  are  among  one  of  the  most
often used classes of agents in the derma-
tologic  armamentarium.  Many  years  of
research  have  led  to  an  ever-widening
scope of uses for these products. The pro-
motion  of  exfoliation,  dermal  collagen
synthesis, and angiogenesis from topical
retinoids  suggests  an  important  role  for
these  products  in  the  attempt  to  curtail
the cutaneous effects of photoaging.

Cleansing Agents

Kumar Subramanyan, PhD
K.P. Ananth

Traditionally,  the  primary  purpose  of
cleansing has been to achieve cleanliness
and  freshness  by  removing  oily  soils,
bacteria,  and  dirt  from  the  face  and
body.  The  need  to  cleanse  in  order  to
maintain personal hygiene has been rec-
ognized for over a 1000 years. While the
use  of  soap-like  materials  for  cleansing
originated  as  early  as  2500  BCE,1 soap
itself  is  believed  to  have  been  invented
sometime  around  600  to  300  BCE.2
Interestingly,  the  steps  involved  in  the
soap  production  process,  known  as
saponification, were a carefully guarded
secret until they were published in 1775,
which eventually paved the way for the
origins  of  the  soap  industry.3 The  first
industrial  manufacturing  of  soap  in  an
individually  wrapped  and  branded  bar
form  occurred  in  1884  in  England.2
Nevertheless, the oldest brand, Yardley,
a  small-scale  perfumery  and  soap  busi-
ness,  was  founded  in  1770,  before  the
large-scale production of soap was given
the  boost  by  the  publication  of  the
saponification  process.  Several  current
including  Colgate
soap  producers, 
Palmolive,  Dial  Corporation,  Andrew
Jergens, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever,
began the manufacturing of soap in the
1800s.3 The  desire  for  cleanliness  and
freshness coupled with the sensory plea-
sures  and  health  benefits  drove  the
growth of the soap industry in the 20th
century.4 Thus,  deodorant  soaps  grew
from a need for health and hygiene ben-
efits  while  the  beauty  segment,  on  the
other hand, grew from a desire for beau-
tiful skin and the pleasures of cleansing
from  using  bars  of  different  colors,  fra-
grances,  and  shapes.  This  chapter  will
discuss the recent evolution in cleansing
agents, focusing on key ingredients, and
product types and their interaction with
the skin.

THE CLEANSER MARKET

synthetic  detergents  into  the  cleansing
arena  in  1948  made  it  possible  to
develop  cleansing  bars 
that  were
demonstrably  milder  and  hence  better
for  skin  than  soaps.4 These  bars  pro-
vided superior skin care benefits as well
as  unique  sensory  cues.  This  was  the
first  step  toward  providing  a  skin  care
benefit from cleansing systems.

The  mild-cleanser  segment  of  the
market  has  grown  over  the  years  with
burgeoning  interest  in  achieving  skin
functional  benefits,  especially  moistur-
ization,  from  wash-off  systems.  The
availability  of  novel  chemicals,  such  as
milder  surfactants  and  polymers,  cou-
pled with an understanding of cleanser-
induced  changes  in  skin  have  led  to
novel  approaches  to  deliver  skin  care
benefits  from  cleansers.5 The  introduc-
tion of new product forms, such as liq-
uid  cleansers  and  cleansing  cloths,  has
facilitated the delivery of skin care bene-
fits from cleansers.

Facial and hand cleansing require dis-
tinct,  specialized  approaches.  Hand
cleansing  is  an  important  part  of  per-
sonal  hygiene  and  can  help  prevent
transmission of infectious germs. Health
care professionals and food handlers are
required to wash their hands frequently
for hygienic reasons and they may often
wash as many as 20 to 30 times a day.
Products used for such applications have
regulatory  standards  in  terms  of  their
bactericidal/germicidal  activity  and
often contain specific active ingredients
in a cleanser base or an alcohol base for
such functions. Frequent washing of the
hands  can  itself  lead  to  dry,  damaged,

irritated  skin.6 Use  of  gentle
and 
cleansers  and  moisturizers  is  necessary
to  maintain  a  healthy  skin  barrier  in
such cases.

Facial cleansing is more often associ-
ated with achieving freshness as well as
enhancing  appearance  and  beauty.
Removing  “oily”  residues  (including
makeup)  without  causing  any  damage
to the skin is essential for facial cleans-
ing.  Currently  available  facial  cleansing
products  include  foaming  (surfactant-
containing)  and  nonfoaming  (low-  to
no-surfactant)  systems  and  towelettes.3
Nonfoaming  cleansers  tend  to  be  mild,
but somewhat less efficient in cleansing.
Cleansing towelettes provide consumers
with  convenience  and  ease  of  use  and
have  been  quite  popular  in  the  devel-
oped markets.

The evolution of skin cleansing tech-
nology from the basic soap to synthetic
detergent  (syndet)  bars  with  moisturiz-
ing  creams,  shower  gels  that  provide
positive  skin  care  benefits,  and  other
formats is depicted in Fig. 31-1.

the degree of mildness or irritancy asso-
ciated with the product. Anionic (nega-
tively  charged)  surfactants,  because  of
their  ideal  foam  and  lather  characteris-
tics,  are  typically  used  as  the  primary
surfactants  in  cleansers.  Because  bars
have to maintain a “solid” form and the
structure  has  to  withstand  processing
conditions,  the  number  of  primary  sur-
factants that can be used in bars is rather
limited.  In  contrast,  surfactants  for
liquid  cleansers  can  exhibit  a  much
wider range of chemistries and can also
incorporate  higher  levels  of  emollients.
The structures of surfactants commonly
used in bars and liquids are provided in
Table 31-1. A brief review of surfactants
used in bar and liquid cleansers follows.

Typical Surfactants Used in
Cleansing Bars

The  primary  surfactant  used  in  most
cleansing  bars  throughout  the  world  is
soap (alkyl carboxylate). Soaps, also called

natural  surfactants,  are  typically  pro-
duced  by  a  saponification  process  that
involves  a  reaction  of  a  triglyceride
oil/fat  with  an  alkali.  Vegetable  oils,
such  as  palm  oil,  palm  oil  derivatives
(palm stearine, palm olein), rice bran oil,
ground nut oil, and castor oil combined
with  coconut  oil  or  palm  kernel  oil  are
typically  used  in  soap  production.3
Nonvegetable  ingredients  used  in  soap
making usually originate from animal fat
such  as  tallow.  Although  effective  as
cleansers, soaps are known to be harsh
to the skin. Erythema, xerosis, and pruri-
tus, especially in cold weather, represent
the  most  common  cutaneous  problems
attributed to the use of soap.3

Several factors influence the irritancy
potential  of  personal  wash  products.7–9
The  surfactant  type  is  the  main  influ-
ence. Because they are the most active in
solution,  surfactants  with  C10 to  C14
chain  lengths  are  the  most  aggressive.
Soap-based  cleansers  typically  contain
surfactants with this chain length distri-
bution.  Poor  rinsability,  which  can  lead
to  surfactant  residue  on  the  skin,  along
with  a  high  pH  augments  the  potential
irritancy of the product.3 If the pH of the
skin  remains  increased  for  more  than 
4 hours as a result of inadequate rinsing
and/or  excessive  washing,  the  resulting
alkalinity  can  irritate  the  skin.10 Typical
soaps  are  characterized  by  a  pH  in  the
range of 9.5 to 11.0, and are hence alka-
line in nature. Attempts to diminish the
irritancy of soaps through the addition of

secondary  components  have  led  to  the
development  of  newer  classes  of  soaps
such  as  superfatted  soaps,  transparent
soaps, and combination bars (combars).3

SUPERFATTED SOAPS These products are
created as a result of incomplete saponi-
fication (neutralization) by leaving unre-
acted fatty acids or oils in the product or
by adding fatty alcohols, fatty acids, or
esters during the manufacturing process.
Superfatting  typically  enhances  various
qualities  of  a  soap  product,  including
mildness and moisturization, as well as
the  lather,  mush  value,  and  wear  rate
characteristics.3,7,11

TRANSPARENT SOAPS These products are
manufactured  with  a  high  level  of
humectants such as glycerol that tend to
solubilize  the  soaps  to  yield  a  transpar-
ent,  clear  appearance.  However,  these
products  contain  high  levels  of  active
soap and an alkaline pH, which tend to
promote  irritancy.  Nevertheless,  trans-
parent soaps are typically rendered mild
by the presence of glycerin, a humectant,
and a low level of total fatty matter.3

COMBINATION  BARS These  products
usually contain natural soaps in combi-
nation with milder synthetic surfactants.
The  synthetic  surfactants  tend  to  blunt
the  irritancy  of  the  product,  although
the  pH  remains  high,  at  approximately
9.0  to  9.5.3 Combars  are  typically  less
irritating than normal soap bars.

SYNTHETIC  DETERGENT  BARS Bars  com-
posed of synthetic surfactants are often
referred  to  as  “syndet  bars.”  Unlike
soaps,  these  surfactants  are  created  via
esterification, ethoxylaton, and sulfona-
tion of oils, fats, or petroleum products.
Alkyl  glyceryl  ether  sulfonate,  alpha
olefin  sulfonates,  betaines,  sulfosucci-
nates,  sodium  cocoyl  monoglyceride
sulfate,  and  sodium  cocoyl  isethionate
are among the commonly included syn-
in  syndet  bars.3
thetic  surfactants 
Cleansing bars with soap (alkyl carboxy-
late)  are  formulated  in  the  alkaline  pH
range  with  pH  values  as  high  as  10  to
10.5.  In  contrast,  syndet  bars  (alkyl
isethionate-based  bars)  are  formulated
in  the  neutral  pH  range.  High-melting-
point  fatty  acids,  waxes,  and  esters  are
among the other ingredients included in
syndet  bars.3 Notably,  sodium  cocoyl
isethionate,  the  most  frequently  used
synthetic  surfactant,  exhibits  unique
molecular  characteristics  that  have
defined  a  new  dimension  in  the  mild-
ness of cleansing bars as described later
in this chapter.

Typical Surfactants Used in
Cleansing Liquids

Liquid cleansers often use a combination
of  anionic  and  amphoteric  (neutral
charge)  surfactants.  Increasingly,  non-
ionic  surfactants  and  amino  acid-based
surfactants are being included in cleanser
systems  because  of  their  capacity  to
enhance mildness. Typical anionic surfac-
tants  used  in  liquid  cleansers  include
soaps (salts of fatty acids) and synthetic
surfactants  such  as  alkyl  ether  sulfate,
alkyl acyl isethionates, alkyl phosphates,
alkyl  sulfosuccinates,  and  alkyl  sul-
fonates.  Amino  acid-based  anionic  sur-
factants such as acyl glycinates are being
used more frequently as primary surfac-
tants 
liquid  cleansing  systems.
Commonly used zwitterionic surfactants
include  cocoamido  propyl  betaine  and
cocoamphoacetate.  Alkyl  polyglucoside
is one of the nonionic surfactants found
in some cleansers. Amino acid-based sur-
factants such as alkyl glutamates, sarcosi-
nates, and glycinates are being used with
increasing  frequency  in  cleansers.  Most
liquid  cleansers  are  formulated  in  the
neutral  to  acidic  pH  range  except  those
that  contain  soap  (alkyl  carboxylate)  as
the main active ingredient; such products
tend to remain in the alkaline range.

in 

perfumes.  Perfume  is  probably  the  sin-
gle  most  expensive  ingredient  in  a
cleanser and its importance from a con-
sumer  perspective  cannot  be  over-
looked.  In  cleansing  bars,  structurants
are  required  to  maintain  the  “solid 
format” and to facilitate the rather com-
plex manufacturing process. Commonly
used  structurants  include  long-chain
fatty  acids,  waxes,  and  alkyl  esters.  In
liquids,  the  role  of  the  structurant  is  to
provide  the  right  rheology/consistency
for  the  product  for  optimal  dispensing
and in-use experience. In addition, struc-
turants  also  ensure  physical  stability  of
dispersed/suspended  phases  and  are
often included to provide moisturization
benefits.  Emollients  are  added  to
cleansers to minimize the drying effects
of  the  surfactants.  Typical  emollients/
occlusives  used  in  moisturizing  shower
gels  are  triglyceride  oils,  lipids,  petrola-
tum,  waxes,  and  mineral  oil.  Water-
soluble humectants such as glycerol are
also used in cleansing systems to impart
a moisturizing effect.

Cleansers  formulated  for  specific
benefits  may  contain  other  functional
ingredients. For example, antimicrobial
cleansers  often  contain  bactericidal
actives such as triclosan or triclocarban.
Such  ingredients  are  limited  to  those
approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug
Administration (FDA) for specific use in
cleansing  products.  The  FDA  regulates
synthetic cleansers and those intended
to confer antibacterial or other drug-like
effects;  the  Consumer  Product  Safety
Commission regulates pure soap prod-
ucts.  Cleansers  designed  for  frequent
hand  disinfection  among  health  care
workers  or  food  handlers  have  even
more stringent requirements and often
contain  potent  cationic  antimicrobials
such  as  chlorohexidine  or  benzalko-
nium  chloride.  Other  functional  ingre-
dients are also found in facial cleansers
designed  for  “acne”  treatment  and
include actives such as salicylic acid or
benzoyl  peroxide.  These  products
often  have  a  relatively  low  pH.  With
advances  in  skin  care  benefit  delivery
from  cleansers,  other  actives  such  as
antiaging ingredients and skin nutrients
are  beginning  to  appear  in  cleansing
formulations.

EFFECTS OF CLEANSERS
ON SKIN

Other Elements of a Skin Cleanser

In addition to surfactants, cleansers con-
tain structurants, sensory modifiers, and

The stratum cornuem (SC) is the upper-
most layer of skin and acts as its protec-
tive  barrier.12–14 The  SC  consists  of
approximately 70% proteins, 15% lipids,

and  15%  water  and  is  about  20  (cid:2)m  in
thickness  (~10(cid:6) layers).  This membrane
prevents extraneous materials from pen-
etrating into the body as well as controls
and prevents the loss of materials from
within the skin. The SC is characterized
by  a  brick-and-mortar-like  structure
with protein bricks embedded in a lipid
matrix  (see  Chapter  1). Protein  bricks,
called  corneocytes,  are  essentially  flat-
tened cells (~2 (cid:2)m in thickness) with a
proteinaceous  envelope  within  which
keratin  bundles  are  present  along  with
low-molecular-weight  water-soluble
amino acids. Part of the water in the SC
is present within the corneocytes and it
is associated with the keratin bundle as
well  as  with  the  low-molecular-weight
amino acids, often referred to as natural
moisturizing  factor  (NMF).  The  rest  of
the water resides with the head groups
of  the  lipid  layer.  Water  in  the  SC  is
important for maintaining its flexibility,
elasticity, and various biologic processes.
Corneocytes  in  one  layer  are  also
bound  to  those  in  adjacent  layers
through  protein  links  called  desmo-
somes.  Enzymes  present  in  the  upper
layers  of  the  SC  break  down  the
desmosomal proteins allowing the cells
to be exfoliated in an orderly manner.12
During cleansing, the SC is exposed to
a  relatively  high  concentration  of  sur-
factants  (5%–20%).  At  these  concen-
trations, surfactants have the ability to
damage  SC  proteins  and  lipids,  and
leaching/removal  of
increase 
water-soluble amino acids (NMF). The
extent  of  damage  depends  upon  the
nature of the surfactant and the cleans-
ing conditions (e.g., water temperature
and hardness).

the 

Immediate (Short-Term) Effects of
Cleansing

SC hydration increases markedly during
cleansing  (since  the  SC  absorbs  water)
and  the  excess  water  evaporates  off
within 10 to 30 minutes after washing.
Hypothetical  curves  of  changes  to  SC
hydration  immediately  after  a  single
wash are depicted in Fig. 31-3. As water
evaporates at a rapid rate from the upper
layers,  a  differential  stress  is  created  in
the SC and this is thought to be the ori-
gin  of  the  after-wash-tightness  percep-
tion. As the evaporation rate reduces to
its normal level, the stress is relieved and
the  tightness  disappears.  These  effects
become  even  more  acute  under  low-
humidity  and  low-temperature  condi-
tions.  Low  humidity  will  certainly
reduce the equilibrium hydration levels
in the SC.

porcine skin assay (Fig. 31-5), the higher
loss of water-soluble proteins after a sin-
gle wash with soap versus syndet is con-
sistent  with  the  higher  damage/drying
potential of the soap.18

Effects on Lipids

Among the three classes of lipids in the
SC,  specifically  cholesterol,  fatty  acids,
and  ceramides,  the  latter  because  of  its
two-tailed  and  unusually  long  alkyl
chain is not likely to get solubilized by
the  surfactants.  Cholesterol  and  lower
chain  length  versions  of  the  fatty  acids
(e.g.,  C18,  C20 fatty  acids  as  opposed  to
C24 and C28 fatty acids) may get solubi-
lized in the micelle. Note, however, that
even  without  any  solubilization  of  SC
lipids  by  surfactant  micelles,  simply  by
surfactant  monomer  intercalation  into
the  bilayer,  stress  and  damage  can  be
imparted to the lipid bilayer. Insertion of
anionic surfactants into the lipid bilayer
can  induce  a  charge  in  the  bilayer  and
alter membrane packing and permeabil-
ity. Results with model liposomes indi-
cate  that  surfactant  insertion  into  the
bilayer  is  usually  the  first  step  toward
destabilizing  the  bilayer,  eventually
leading  to  the  break-up  of  the  bilayer
and  yielding  mixed  micelle  formation/
solubilization of the liposome.19,20 Even
partial/preferential  removal  of  lipids
such as cholesterol from the SC can ren-
der  the  bilayer  lipid  unstable.  Results
regarding the removal of cholesterol by
soap and the syndet bar are provided in
Fig.  31-5 and  show  that  soap  removes
more cholesterol than the syndet. While
the exact reasons for this difference are

benefits of pH-neutral cleansing.

Harsh  surfactants  have  been  shown
to  also  remove  more  NMF  from  skin.17
This  may  be  because  of  the  damage  to
the  corneocyte  envelope  caused  by  the
harsh surfactant that exposes intracellu-
lar NMF to leaching. Surfactant binding
to  proteins  may  also  reduce  the  water-
holding  capacity  of  the  proteins.  In
either  case,  there 
is  a  correlation
between harshness of the surfactant and
the increasing loss of water-soluble pro-
teins. As can be seen in the results of a

Three factors govern how SC hydra-
tion  changes  during  and  immediately
after washing5: (1) the amount of water
that the SC absorbs during cleansing; (2)
the  rate  of  water  evaporation  immedi-
ately  after  drying;  and  (3)  the  equilib-
rium SC water content as determined by
the  humidity  and  temperature  condi-
tions immediately after washing. All of
these  changes  are  influenced  by  the
nature of the cleanser surfactant through
its impact on the SC proteins and lipids
as briefly described below.

Effects on Proteins

Most  of  the  water  absorbed  by  the  SC
during  cleansing  is  present  within  the
corneocytes and results in significant pro-
tein  swelling.  Surfactants  increase  the
swelling further and the extent of surfac-
tant-induced swelling is dependent upon
the nature of the surfactant. Increased SC
swelling has been shown to increase irri-
tancy and is useful as a predictor of sur-
factant irritation potential.15,16 Figure 31-4
provides a comparison of SC swelling in
the presence of surfactant active ingredi-
ents in a soap and a syndet bar. Results
demonstrate  that  the  extent  of  swelling
in the presence of sodium laurate (soap)
is  significantly  higher  than  in  the  pres-
ence of sodium cocoyl isethionate (syn-
det).  Other  factors  such  as  solution  pH
and  temperature  can  further  affect  the
swelling. For example, high pH solutions
(pH  9(cid:6))  even  without  the  presence  of
surfactants have been shown to increase

not clear at present, it is likely that the
high pH of soap allows ionization of the
bilayer  fatty  acids,  facilitating  choles-
terol  extraction  from  the  SC.  It  is  also
possible  that  the  increased  swelling  of
soap-damaged  SC  allows  deeper  layers
of  the  epidermis  to  be  exposed  to  the
cleansing surfactant.

Cumulative (Longer-Term) Effects of
Repeated Exposure to Surfactants

Continued  daily  use  of  cleansers  that
cause  short-term  damage  can  lead  to
skin dryness, scaling, flaking, erythema,
and pruritus.21 While detailed molecular
mechanisms  involved  in  these  effects
have not been fully elucidated, based on
current  understanding,  several  possible
mechanisms  can  be  hypothesized  as
detailed below.

Dryness, Scaling, and Flaking

Skin  dryness,  or  xerosis,  is  more  than
just  a  lack  of  water  in  the  SC  (see
Chapter  11).  It  is  actually  a  disruption
in  the  biologic  processes  underlying
healthy normal skin, which affects clin-
ical as well as patient/consumer percep-
tion  of  skin  condition.  Consumer  per-
ception  of  dryness  has  both  a  visible
and a tactile component. Visual effects

of dryness are manifested by whitening
of the skin and the development of vis-
ible scaling. Dry skin is also physically
tighter, more brittle, and less soft than
moisturized  skin.  Brittle  SC  can  easily
crack,  leading  to  chapping  and  signifi-
cant barrier damage.

Factors  that  cause  excessive  swelling
followed  by  reduced  water  retention
capacity in the SC will allow the corneo-
cytes to swell and shrink repeatedly, and
this  cycle  can  create  stresses  leading  to
debonding of the corneocytes from the
surrounding lipid matrix. With time, the
effect  may  propagate  down  to  deeper
cutaneous  layers  leading  to  cracking  in
the  SC,  a  poor  barrier,  and  excessive
water loss.

in 

Reduction 

the  water-holding
capacity  of  the  SC  can  also  render  the
corneocyte proteins brittle and vulnera-
ble  to  cracking.  Keratins  in  the  SC  are
characterized  by  a  glass  transition
temperature 
just  below  the  body
temperature,22 and  this  is  sensitive  to
humidity levels. The glass transition tem-
perature is the point below which a mate-
rial  becomes  brittle.  As  the  humidity/
water content of the SC decreases, glass
transition  temperature  increases  to  val-
ues  above  the  body  temperature  thus
leaving  the  corneocytes  brittle  at  body
temperature.

The  presence  of  water  in  the  SC  is
essential  for  enzymes  to  cleave  the
desmosomes.  In  dry  skin  inadequate
desmosomal  degradation  can  occur,
leading to the accumulation of dry cells.
The result is severe xerosis with exces-
sive flakiness in the SC.

Similar  to  water  plasticizing  the
proteins, fluid lipids in the bilayer lipids
are implicated in the elasticity of the SC.
Removal  of  fluid  lipids  can  render  the
SC brittle. Specifically, solvent treatment
of  the  SC  to  eliminate  fluid  lipids  has
been shown to make the SC brittle.23 In
addition,  it  has  been  demonstrated
that  soap-treated  SC  acts  similarly  to
solvent-treated  SC  insofar  as  both
exhibit a brittle fracture under tension.
In  contrast,  syndet  bar-treated  SC
behaves  more  like  water-treated  SC,
exhibiting  a  more  elastic  and  pliable
structure.

Visible skin dryness has been found
to  correlate  positively  with  surface
hydration, but not necessarily with an
increase  in  transepidermal  water  loss
(TEWL).24 This  suggests  that  signifi-
cant  barrier  breakdown 
is  not  a
requirement for skin dryness. A contin-
ued increase in dryness may, however,
lead to scaling, cracking and chapping,
barrier  breakdown  and,  eventually,  to
irritation.

Erythema and Pruritus

Erythema  and  pruritus  are  essentially
inflammatory  responses  of  the  skin
when irritants, such as surfactants, pene-
trate into deeper layers of the SC. In the
cleansing context, this is usually because
of a breakdown of the barrier for reasons
indicated  above,  leading  to  penetration
of irritant materials. Note, however, that
it may not be necessary for the surfactant
to penetrate into dermal layers to elicit a
response.  Communication  via  produc-
tion of cytokines in the SC can also elicit
a response from the dermis.21

Factors  that  enhance  the  penetration
of surfactants can be expected to increase
surfactant-induced  irritation.  Thus,  a
swollen SC will allow increased penetra-
tion of the surfactant into deeper layers.
The ability of a surfactant to swell the SC
is  an  indication  of  its  ability  to  enhance
its  own  penetration  into  deeper  layers
and  disrupt  the  cells  in  the  living  layer.
This  may  be  the  scientific  basis  for  the
established correlation between the abil-
ity of surfactants to swell the SC and its
irritation potential. If the swelling occurs
by other mechanisms such as an increase
in the protein negative charge because of
high solution pH,25 penetration of surfac-
tants can also be expected to be enhanced
under  these  conditions.  Thus,  the  direct
effect of pH 10 by itself on the SC could
contribute  to  increased  surfactant  irrita-
tion.  Changes  in  lipid  layers  at  pH  10
may  also  impact  irritation  in  that  their
increased rigidity may render them more
vulnerable  to  cracking  and  debonding
from the corneocytes thereby permitting
penetration of irritants.

TECHNOLOGY OF MILD,
MOISTURIZING CLEANSING

The first step toward mild cleansing is to
minimize  the  deleterious  potential  of
surfactants  to  proteins  and  lipids.  The
next step is to compensate for the dam-
age  and  deliver  positive  benefits  by
incorporating  cutaneously  ameliorative
agents into the cleanser.

Minimizing Surfactant 
Protein Damage

As discussed earlier, surfactants that inter-
act potently with SC proteins leading to
their  swelling  and  denaturation  have  an
increased  potential  to  cause  erythema,
and  itching.19,21 The  tendency  of  surfac-
tants  to  interact  with  model  proteins  in
vitro has also been associated with their
harshness toward human skin. Thus, the
greater  the  tendency  of  a  surfactant  to

lar  protein  such  as  BSA,28 or  dissolve  a
water-insoluble  hydrophobic  protein
such  as  zein,29,  30 the  greater  is  its  ten-
dency  to  irritate  human  skin.  Results  of
zein solubilization by several surfactants
are provided in Fig. 31-6. As can be seen,
the  proclivity  of  surfactants  to  interact
with  proteins  follows  the  order:  anionic
(cid:3) amphoteric (cid:3) nonionic. This is consis-
tent  with  the  published  results  revealing
the  protein-damaging  predispositions  of
various classes of surfactants. Figure 31-6
also shows the syndet bar active ingredi-
ent sodium cocoyl isethionate to have sig-
nificantly  less  interaction  with  proteins
than  soap.  This  can  be  attributed  to  its
larger head group area and lower micellar
charge  density  as  compared  to  sodium
soaps. Similarly, the commonly used sur-
factant system for liquid cleansers, a com-
bination  of  sodium  lauryl  ether  sulfate
(SLES)  and  cocoamido  propyl  betaine
(CAPB), is significantly milder than soap.
Table  31-2 displays  a  list  of  commonly
used cleanser surfactants classified as rela-
tively harsh or mild.

While these empirical correlations are
useful  as  guidelines  for  formulation
work, quantitative associations between
surfactant  properties  and  their  protein
denaturation propensities are most use-
ful  as  a  predictive  ruler.  Based  on  the
hypothesis  that  protein  denaturation  is
essentially  due  to  massive  cooperative

binding  of  surfactants  on  the  protein
backbone  and  the  resultant  increase  in
the  charge  of  the  protein,  surfactant
micellar charge was correlated with the
zein  dissolution  tendencies  of  various
surfactants.  Protein  denaturation  has
been  shown  to  scale  linearly  with  the
charge  density  of  surfactant  micelles.31
This insight has allowed formulators to
develop  novel  strategies  to  predict  and
increase the mildness of cleanser bases.
In general, micelle charge density can be
lowered  by  using  surfactants  of  larger
head  groups,  zwitterionic  or  nonionic
head groups, and a synergistic combina-
tion  of  surfactants  that  allow  strong
interactions  among  head
attractive 
groups  leading  to  a  reduction  in  the
overall charge density of the micelle.

Minimizing Surfactant Lipid Damage

Long-term surfactant damage to SC lipids
extends  from  the  short-term  effects
resulting  in  cumulative  loss  of  barrier
function and lipid fluidity leading to pro-
found  dryness.  The  results  of  an  assess-
ment of lipid damage potential of surfac-
tants  as  measured  by  the  solubility  of
stearic acid and cholesterol in 5% surfac-
tant  solutions  are  shown  in  Fig.  31-7.  It
appears that all the surfactants have some
proclivity  to  solubilize  critical  SC  lipids
such  as  cholesterol  and  fatty  acids.
Interestingly,  APG  shows  high  potential
for solubilizing cholesterol in contrast to
its  relatively 
low  protein  swelling
tendency. This result shows that mildness
toward  proteins  does  not  necessarily
imply mildness toward lipids, and achiev-
ing  mildness  toward  both  proteins  and
lipids  simultaneously  may  require  deli-
cate balancing of surfactant properties.

A  relatively  less  understood  mecha-
nism, namely, the presaturation of surfac-
tant micelles with lipid mimics so that the
micelle will have a reduced likelihood of
delipidating  the  SC  during  washing,  is  a
novel  approach  to  minimize  surfactant–
lipid interactions. The hypothesis is that

the  added  fatty  acids  actually  minimize
the damage to both proteins and lipids by
incorporating into the surfactant micelles
thus rendering the micelles milder toward
both  proteins  and  lipids.32 Presaturation
of the micelles with fatty acids will reduce
the tendency of the micelles to solubilize
SC lipids or intercalate into the SC bilayer.
Also, the presence of fatty acids can lower
the  charge  density  of  the  surfactant
micelles,  thus  enhancing  their  mildness
toward proteins.

Compensating for Damage:
Enhancing Moisturization

The main approach to minimizing visi-
ble  signs  of  skin  dryness  and  augment-
ing  skin  hydration  has  been  to  deposit
lipids,  emollient  oils,  and  occlusives
(such  as  those  used  in  a  lotion)  under
cleansing  conditions.  The  challenges  of
incorporating  high  levels  of  emollients
into  a  stable  cleansing  formulation  and
depositing the emollients on skin during
the wash process have been largely sur-
mounted  by  the  use  of  specially  struc-
tured  surfactant  formulations  with
cationic polymers to aid deposition and
retention of oils/occlusives on the skin.

Typical  emollients  and  occlusives  used
in cleansing liquid formulations are veg-
etable oils (e.g., sunflower seed and soy-
bean)  and  petroleum  jelly.  It  is  a  more
significant  challenge  to  deliver  water-
soluble  moisturizers  such  as  glycerin
and other humectants to skin during the
washing  process 
therefore,
hydrophobic  emollients  are  more  com-
monly used in cleansers.

and, 

It  has  been  demonstrated  that  body
washes  containing  a  high  level  of  emol-
lient  ingredients  do  deposit  a  significant
amount of lipid and emollient material to
the skin. A commercial product containing
sunflower seed oil was shown to deposit
10 to 15 (cid:2)g/cm2 of the emollient onto skin
during a normal wash.5 Figure 31-8 depicts
the  clinical  advantage  of  such  deposition
on  skin  during  cleansing.  Note  that  the
efficiency of deposition (amount of mater-
ial transferred to skin versus amount con-
tained in the product) from current tech-
nologies is still quite low, which presents
an opportunity for enhancing the perfor-
mance  of  these  moisturizing  body
washes. Another area of opportunity is to
deliver  effective  water-soluble  moisturiz-
ers  such  as  glycerin  or  lactates  from  a
cleanser.  These  humectant  materials  are

recruited to participate in the study. The
patients, each under the care of a board-
certified  dermatologist,  were  instructed
to use either a soap bar or mild syndet bar
to cleanse their face for a 4-week period.
Patient  skin  was  rated  clinically  for  ery-
thema,  peeling,  dryness,  burning,  sting-
ing,  itching,  and  tightness,  each  using  a 
4-point  scale  from  0  (cid:4) none  to  3  (cid:4)
severe.  An  overall  assessment  of  acne

condition was made using a 6-point scale
from 1 (cid:4) very severe to 6 (cid:4) almost clear.
Figures  31-9 and  31-10 show  the
changes in skin condition between base-
line and week 4, based on the dermatol-
ogist’s  assessment  of  the  patients.  It  is
evident that for the patients using soap,
the clinical measures of irritation such as
peeling,  dryness,  and  irritation  wors-
ened during the 4-week period, while no
significant  changes  in  irritation  mea-
sures were seen for those patients using
the  syndet  bar.  The  patient  self-assess-
ment revealed several advantages for the
mild cleansing bar.

Retin-A Photodamage Treatment

Retin-A  (tretinoin)  is  a  commonly  used
topical treatment for acne and other skin
disorders,  and  more  recently  as  a  treat-
ment for the lines, wrinkles, and uneven
pigmentation  characteristic  of  photo-
damaged skin. Because Retin-A increases
skin  susceptibility  to  irritation,  patients
using  topical  Retin-A  should  use  a
cleanser  that  does  not  exacerbate  the
state of their weakened barrier.

A 4-week, normal-use study was con-
ducted involving a mild syndet cleansing
bar  on  subjects  under  maintenance
therapy  with  Retin-A  for  treatment  of
photodamaged  facial  skin.  Of  the  36
female subjects, aged from 24 to 60 years,

ROLE OF MILD CLEANSING 
IN MANAGEMENT OF 
DERMATOLOGIC DISORDERS

Several common skin disorders such as
xerosis, dermatitis, psoriasis, atopic der-
matitis, acne, rosacea, and photodamage
are  linked  to  varying  levels  of  barrier
dysfunctions.12 Skin  cleansing  is  an
essential  part  of  skin  care.  Its  primary
role,  as  mentioned  previously,  is  to
remove  dirt,  oil,  other  environmental
pollutants,  and  bacteria  from  the  skin.
However, it is paradoxical that the act of
cleansing typically leads to a weakening
of  the  barrier  as  described  above.
Therefore, it appears that for most skin
disorders,  cleansing  with  commonly
used  soap-based  products  may  prove
challenging and lead to an exacerbation
of patients’ skin disorders.

The  importance  of  mild  cleansing  in
the  management  of  compromised  skin
conditions such as acne, rosacea, atopic
dermatitis,  and  photodamage  has  been
discussed  in  detail  in  references  33  and
34.  A  couple  of  examples  from  these
references are illustrated here.

pleted the study. On day 1, the subjects
were examined by the dermatologist to
determine  their  eligibility  for  enroll-
ment.  The  study  parameters  were

evaluated using a 4-point ordinal scoring
scale (0 (cid:4) none to 3  (cid:4) severe).

In addition to being evaluated by the
dermatologist,  the  subjects  were  asked
to complete a self-assessment question-

naire on the condition of their facial skin
at the start of the test. Following enroll-
ment,  the  subjects  were  instructed  to
use the syndet bar (in lieu of their nor-
mal facial cleanser) to cleanse their face
for the next 4 weeks. A diary was given
to  the  subjects  to  document  daily  use
routines and any comments concerning
skin reactions. The subjects returned to
the  test  facility  after  4  weeks.  At  that
time, a final skin examination was per-
formed by the dermatologist. Also, sub-
jects  were  asked  to  complete  the  skin
self-assessment questionnaire (as at the
beginning  of  the  test)  to  monitor  their
perceived change in skin condition over
the 4 weeks of product use.

for  patients  with  chronic,  as  well  as

Moisturizing Agents

Leslie Baumann, MD

Moisturization research was spearheaded
in the 1950s when Blank demonstrated
that low moisture content of the skin is
a prime factor in dry skin conditions.1 In
the  last  50  years,  many  scientists  have
devoted  their 
lives  to  researching
moisturization  and  have  begun  to
unravel the mysteries of skin hydration
(see Chapter 11). It is now known that
the symptoms of dry skin can be treated
by increasing the hydration state of the
stratum corneum (SC) with occlusive or
humectant  ingredients  and  by  smooth-
ing the rough surface with an emollient.
Moisturizers  represent  a  multibillion
dollar  market  in  the  US.  Commonly
used moisturizers are oil-in-water emul-
sions,  such  as  creams  and  lotions,  and
water-in-oil  emulsions  such  as  hand
creams.  There  are  two  main  types  of
ingredients: occlusives and humectants.
A  good  moisturizer  usually  contains
both  components.  This  chapter  will
identify and discuss the mechanisms of
action of the main components found in
popular moisturizers.

MECHANISM OF ACTION
OF MOISTURIZERS

There are many moisturizers on the mar-
ket  but  they  all  have  the  same  goal:  to
increase  water  content  in  the  SC.  This
can  be  accomplished  by  preventing
water  evaporation  from  the  skin  by
using occlusive ingredients or by increas-
ing  the  integrity  of  the  skin  barrier  (see
Chapter 11). The mainstay of increasing
the integrity of the skin’s barrier involves
providing  fatty  acids  (such  as  linoleic
acid,  Fig.  32-1),  ceramides,  cholesterol,
and  controlling  the  calcium  gradient.
Increasing the skin’s ability to hold onto
water is another strategy for moisturiz-
ing  skin.  Increasing  levels  of  natural
moisturizing  factor  (NMF),  glycerin
(glycerol), and other humectants such as
hyaluronic acid will help skin hold onto
water. Lastly, increasing the ability of the

epidermis  to  absorb  important  compo-
nents for the circulation, such as glycerol
and  water  through  aquaporin  channels,
will also aid in increasing skin hydration.

many  find  the  greasy,  oily  texture  cos-
metically  inelegant.  Therefore,  petrola-
tum is often combined with other ingre-
dients to minimize the greasy feeling.

OCCLUSIVES

Occlusives coat the SC to retard transepi-
dermal water loss (TEWL). They are usu-
ally oily substances that have the ability
to dissolve fats and are therefore widely
used as a component in skin care cosmet-
ics.  An  occlusive  is  one  of  the  best
choices  to  treat  dry  skin  because  it  pro-
vides  an  emollient  effect  as  well  as
decreases TEWL. Two of the best occlu-
sive  ingredients  currently  available  are
petrolatum  and  mineral  oil.  Petrolatum,
for example, exhibits a water vapor loss
resistance  170  times  that  of  olive  oil.2
However, petrolatum has a greasy feeling
that  may  render  agents  containing  it
cosmetically  unacceptable.  Other  com-
monly used occlusive ingredients include
paraffin, squalene, dimethicone, soybean
oil, grapeseed oil, propylene glycol, lano-
lin,  and  beeswax.3 In  addition,  “natural”
oils  such  as  sunflower  oil  have  been
increasing in popularity. Occlusive agents
are  only  effective  while  present  on  the
skin; once removed, TEWL returns to the
previous  level.  Interestingly,  it  is  not
desirable  to  lower  TEWL  by  more  than
40% because maceration with increased
levels of bacteria can result.4 In moisturiz-
ers, occlusives are usually combined with
humectant ingredients.

Petrolatum

Petrolatum  is  considered  by  many,
including Kligman,5 to be one of the best
moisturizers. It has been used as a skin
care product since 1872. Petrolatum is a
purified mixture of hydrocarbons that is
derived from petroleum (crude oil). The
hydrocarbon molecules present in petro-
latum prevent oxidation, giving petrola-
tum a long shelf life. Because petrolatum
is  one  of  the  most  occlusive  moisturiz-
ing  ingredients  known,  it  is  often  the
gold  standard  to  which  other  occlusive
ingredients are compared.6 Petrolatum is
also well known for being noncomedo-
genic.7 Although extremely rare, allergic
contact  dermatitis  to  petrolatum  has
been  reported  in  the  literature.8,9 The
possibility of an individual being allergic
to petrolatum is so infrequent that some
authors believe it to be a nonsensitizing
agent.10 However,  when  used  alone,

Lanolin

Lanolin  is  a  complex  natural  product
that cannot be synthesized. The method
of refinement used determines the com-
position  and  quality  of  the  resulting
product, so not all lanolin products dis-
play  the  same  properties.11 Lanolin  is
derived from the sebaceous secretions of
sheep; however, its composition is very
different  than  human  sebum.12 Lanolin
shares  two  important  characteristics
with SC lipids: (1) lanolin contains cho-
lesterol,  an  essential  component  of  SC
lipids, and (2) lanolin and SC lipids can
coexist  as  solids  and  liquids  at  physio-
logic temperatures. Unfortunately, there
is  a  subset  of  individuals  who  develop
contact  sensitization  to  lanolin;  there-
fore, it has developed a reputation as a
sensitizer that, according to some, may
be  undeserved.13 Many  moisturizing
products  are  now  labeled  as  “lanolin
free.” The concern over allergic reactions
to lanolin has led to the development of
ultra-pure  medical  grade  lanolin  prod-
ucts  such  as  MedilanTM.  Medilan  and
Medilan  Ultra  have  been  shown  to  be
effective in the treatment of xerotic skin
and superficial wound healing.14–16

Oils

With  the  surge  in  popularity  of  natural
and organic ingredients, essential oils are
now  commonly  used  in  moisturizing
products  or  as  moisturizing  agents
themselves.  In  addition,  moisturizing
“cleansing  oils”  are  also  commercially
available. Oil is a substance that is liquid
at  room  temperature  and  insoluble  in
water.  It  is  both  hydrophobic  and
lipophilic.  In  fact,  oils  contain  copious
lipids,  which  the  skin  requires  for  the
proper  formation  and  function  of  cell
membranes to prevent TEWL. Vegetable
oils are pressed out of seeds and essential
oils are steamed from several plant parts,
including stems, leaves, and roots. Not all
oils are of botanical origin. Mineral oil, or
liquid  petrolatum,  is  derived  from  the
distillation of petroleum in the production
of gasoline.

modern  cosmetic  agents  for  more  than
100 years, mineral oil is one of the most
frequently  used  oils 
in  skin  care 
products.17 Nearly 20 years ago, investi-
gators found that an emulsion containing
mineral oil was more effective than sev-
eral  linoleic  acid  emulsions  in  diminish-
ing skin vapor loss induced in volunteers
by  the  topical  application  of  the  surfac-
tant  sodium  lauryl  sulfate.18 In  2004,  a
randomized,  double-blind,  and  con-
trolled trial showed that mineral oil and
extra virgin coconut oil were equally effi-
cacious and safe as moisturizers in treat-
ing  mild-to-moderate  xerosis  in  34
patients, with surface lipid level and skin
hydration significantly enhanced in both
groups.19 Because  of  its  source,  though,
several criticisms, and some myths, have
emerged  regarding  mineral  oil.  In  fact,
more than 10 years ago, an epidemiologic
review of the relationship between min-
eral oil exposure and cancer revealed sev-
eral associations.20 Importantly, however,
any  such  evidence  linking  mineral  oil
exposure  (via  dermal  contact  or  inhala-
tion)  and  specific  forms  of  cancer  has
been  derived  from  cases  of  protracted
exposure  to  industrial  grade  mineral  oil.
Cosmetic  grade  mineral  oil  has  never
been  associated  with  cancer  etiology.
Furthermore,  a  recent  study  suggested
that  even  though  industrial  grade  min-
eral  oil  may  be  comedogenic,  cosmetic
grade  mineral  oil  patently  is  not,  and,
consequently,  should  not  be  excluded
from  appropriate  cosmetic  formulations
because of lingering myths or extrapola-
tions  from  industrial  grade  mineral  oil
regarding comedogenicity.17

Natural Oils

Natural oils contain fatty acids that are
important  in  maintaining  the  skin  bar-
rier. Linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid
present  in  sunflower,  safflower,  and
other oils, is an example of an essential
fatty  acid  that  must  be  obtained  from
the  diet  or  through  topical  application.
In addition to providing structural lipids
needed for barrier integrity, linoleic acid
is  used  by  the  body  to  produce 
(cid:9)-linolenic acid (GLA). GLA is a polyun-
saturated  essential  cis fatty  acid  impor-
tant in the production of prostaglandins;
therefore,  it  plays  a  role  in  the  inflam-
matory  process.  Many  oils  and  foods
contain linoleic acid (Table 32-1). Several
of these oils are found in skin care prod-
ucts that supply fatty acids while func-
tioning as occlusive agents.

sunflower  oil,  oleic  and  linoleic  acids,
are fatty acids that, as suggested above,
confer particular benefits to the skin. In
a study by Darmstadt et al. intended to
identify safe and inexpensive vegetable
oils that are effective in enhancing epi-
dermal barrier function and available in
developing  countries,  researchers  test-
ing  various  oils  on  mouse  epidermal
barrier  function  found  that  mustard,
olive,  and  soybean  oils  significantly
delayed recovery compared to controls
or  skin  treated  with  Aquaphor,  which
is used to ameliorate skin barrier func-
tion. However, one application of sun-
flower  seed  oil  significantly  acceler-
ated  skin  barrier  function  recovery
within  an  hour  and  sustained  this
result 5 hours after application.21 More
recently,  some  of  the  same  investiga-
tors  compared  the  effects  of  the  topi-
cally applied emollients sunflower seed
oil and Aquaphor in the prevention of
nosocomial  infections  in  very  low
birthweight  premature 
in
Bangladesh.  Infants  born  before  week
33 of gestation after hospital admission
were randomly assigned to daily mas-
sage with either agent (159 subjects in
each group) and results were compared
with  181  untreated  controls  by  inten-
tion-to-treat  analysis.  Infants  treated
with sunflower seed oil were 41% less
likely to develop nosocomial infections
as  compared  to  controls.  (Aquaphor
performed slightly better than no treat-
ment,  but  did  not  significantly  reduce
infection risk.) This study also fulfilled
one of the aims of the earlier study by
Darmstadt  et  al.,  finding  sunflower
seed  oil  an  effective,  affordable,  and
available  emollient  option  for  patients
in developing countries.22

EVENING  PRIMROSE  OIL 
(OENOTHERA
BIENNIS) Evening  primrose  oil  (EPO)  is
rich  in  omega-6  fatty  acids,  containing
linoleic  and  (cid:9)-linolenic  acids.
both 
Indeed,  EPO  is  thought  to  be  the  best
known  source  of  GLA.  Linoleic  acid,
which  helps  to  maintain  SC  cohesion
and  contributes  to  TEWL  reduction,  is
also  used  by  the  body  to  synthesize
GLA.23 EPO  is  usually  taken  as  an  oral
supplement but is also included in topi-
cal  skin  care  products.  Some  studies  of
EPO  have  revealed  significant  effects  in
the treatment of atopic dermatitis; how-
ever, studies have been largely inconsis-
tent  regarding  such  an  application.24
Nevertheless,  the  presence  of  linoleic
and (cid:9)-linolenic acids may justify the use
of EPO in patients with dry skin or poor
nutrition.

OLIVE  OIL  (OLEA  EUROPAEA) Used  by  the
ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans
for  bathing  as  well  as  medicinal  pur-
poses,  olive  oil  contains  various  potent
compounds,  many  with  antioxidant
properties,  such  as  polyphenols,  squa-
lene, fatty acids (particularly oleic acid),
triglycerides,  tocopherols,  carotenoids,
sterols, and chlorophylls.25 In particular,
the phenols in virgin olive oil are known
to scavenge reactive oxygen 25 and nitro-
gen  species  active  in  human  disease;
however,  it  is  unknown  whether  the
influence  of  these  compounds  extends
beyond the extracellular environment.26
Adverse  side  effects  associated  with
olive oil are very rare, as this natural oil
is  generally  regarded  as  safe  and  very
weakly irritant.27

JOJOBA (BUXUS CHINENSIS OR SIMMONDSIA
CHINENSIS) Jojoba  (pronounced  ho-ho-
ba)  oil  is  derived  from  the  cold-pressed
peanut- or small olive-sized seeds of the
jojoba  plant  and  contains  several  fatty
acids  including  oleic,  linoleic,  linolenic,
and arachidonic acids.25 Triglycerides are
also among the key components of jojoba
oil.  Significantly,  jojoba  oil  is  similar  in
consistency  with  human  sebum,  which
is,  in  turn,  readily  compatible  with  the
constituent  fatty  acids  and  triglycerides
contained in this natural polyunsaturated
liquid  wax.  Consequently  considered  to
be a natural moisturizer, jojoba oil, which
is typically used as a humectant, has been
found  to  exhibit  significant  beneficial
properties  as  an  analgesic,  antibacterial,
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antipara-
sitic, and antipyretic agent.25

Essential  oils  have  significantly
increased  in  popularity  in  recent  years.
However, it is crucial to realize that these
ingredients  are  common  allergens.28

 
 
 
Massage  therapists  and  others  who  are
routinely exposed to essential oils should
try  and  limit  their  exposure  in  order  to
lower their risk for developing an allergy
to the topically applied oil that can trans-
late to an allergy to the related oil in food
products.29

HUMECTANTS

in 

Humectants are water-soluble materials
with high water absorption capabilities.
They have the capacity to attract water
from  the  atmosphere  (if  atmospheric
humidity is greater than 80%) and from
the  underlying  epidermis.  Although
humectants  may  draw  water  from  the
environment to help hydrate the skin, in
low-humidity conditions they may take
water  from  the  deeper  epidermis  and
dermis  resulting 
increased  skin
dryness.30 For  this  reason,  they  work
better when combined with occlusives.
Humectants  are  also  popular  additives
to  cosmetic  moisturizers  because  they
prevent  product  evaporation  and  thick-
ening, thereby extending the shelf life of
various moisturizers. Some humectants
have  bacteriostatic  activity  as  well.31
Humectants  draw  water  into  the  skin,
causing a slight swelling of the SC that
gives  the  perception  of  smoother  skin
with fewer wrinkles. As a result, many
moisturizers  are  touted  as  “antiwrinkle
creams”  even  though  they  impart  no
long-term antiwrinkling effect. Examples
of  commonly  used  humectants  include
glycerin,  sorbitol,  sodium  hyaluronate,
urea,  propylene  glycol,  alpha  hydroxy
acids, and sugars.

Glycerin

Glycerin (glycerol) is a strong humectant
and  has  a  hygroscopic  ability  that
closely  resembles  that  of  NMF 32 (see
Chapter 11). This also allows the SC to
retain a high water content even in a dry
environment. Recent studies by Choi et
al.  have  shown  that  glycerol  plays  an
important role in skin hydration because
glycerol levels correlate with SC hydra-
tion levels.33

Appa  et  al.  compared  two  high-glyc-
erin  moisturizers  to  16  other  popular
moisturizers in 394 patients with severely
dry  skin.34 The  high-glycerin  products
were superior to all other products tested
over  this  five-year  period  because  they
rapidly restored dry skin to normal hydra-
tion. They also helped prevent the return
to  dryness  for  a  longer  period  than  the
other formulations, even those containing
petrolatum.  Ultrastructural  analysis  of

skin treated with “high glycerin” formula-
tions  shows  that  glycerin  causes  an
expansion of the SC because of increased
thickness  of 
the  corneocytes  and
expanded  spaces  between  layers  of
corneocytes.35 These findings suggest that
glycerin  appears  to  create  a  reservoir  of
moisture-holding ability that renders the
skin  more  resistant  to  drying  as  seen  in
Appa’s study. Glycerin also functions by
stabilizing and fluidizing cell membranes
and  by  hydrating  enzymes  needed  for
desmosome degradation.34

Glycerol can be obtained from topical
preparations but can also be transported
from  the  circulation  into  the  epidermis
through aquaporin channels (see Chapter
11). Recent studies have shown that nor-
mal  SC  hydration  requires  endogenous
glycerol.36 Two unrelated inbred mouse
models  demonstrated  the  potential
importance  of  endogenous  glycerol  for
normal  SC  hydration.  Knockout  mice,
which  lack  the  aquaporin-3  (AQP-3)
water  channel,  are  unable  to  transport
glycerol  from  the  circulation  into  the
epidermis and they exhibit abnormal SC
hydration  and  reduced  SC  glycerol
levels.37 This defect in mice is corrected
when  glycerol  is  applied  topically.38
Glycerin  has  been  available  for  many
years  but  this  new  research  suggests
that it is here to stay.

Urea

Urea is a component of the NMF. It has
been  used  in  hand  creams  since  the
1940s.39 In  addition  to  being  a  humec-
tant,  urea  displays  a  mild  antipruritic
effect.40 Although there is some disagree-
ment  in  the  literature,  several  studies
have shown that the combination of urea
with  hydrocortisone,41 retinoic  acid,42
and other agents increases penetration of
these  agents.  In  a  double-blind  experi-
ment,  3%  and  10%  urea  cream  were
shown  to  be  more  effective  in  dry  skin
than  the  vehicle-control.  Interestingly,
TEWL  was  unchanged  after  treatment
with the 3% urea cream, while the 10%
urea  cream  caused  a  decrease  in  TEWL
although the creams were reported clini-
cally to be equally effective.43

Hydroxy Acids

Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are a fam-
ily  of  naturally-occurring  organic  acids
that  function  as  humectants;  they  also
exhibit  exfoliating  properties.  Glycolic
and  lactic  acids,  derived,  respectively
from  sugar  cane  and  sour  milk,  are  the
most commonly used AHAs in moistur-
izing products and were the first ones to

reach  the  market.  Other  AHAs  include
malic  acid,  derived  from  apples,  citric
acid,  derived  from  acid  fruits,  and  tar-
taric acid, derived from grapes.44 Topical
preparations  that  contain  AHAs  have
long  been  known  to  exert  significant
influence on epidermal keratinization.45
Salicylic  acid,  a  chemical  exfoliant  and
the  lone  beta  hydroxy  acid  (BHA),  is
derived  from  willow  bark,  wintergreen
leaves, and sweet birch, but is also avail-
able in synthetic form.46

The cosmetic effects of hydroxy acids
include  normalization  of  SC  exfoliation
resulting  in  increased  plasticization  and
decreased formation of dry scales on the
surface of the skin. AHAs and BHA func-
tion  by  degrading  the  desmosomes  and
allowing desquamation to proceed. They
also influence corneocyte cohesiveness at
the  basement  levels  of  the  SC,47 where
they affect its pH and improve desquama-
tion.48 The application of AHAs and BHA
in  high  concentrations  leads  to  detach-
ment of keratinocytes and epidermolysis;
application  at 
lower  concentrations
degrades intercorneocyte cohesion directly
above  the  granular  layer,  which  furthers
desquamation and thinning of the SC. A
thinner SC is more flexible and compact,
giving  the  skin  a  more  youthful  appear-
ance.  This  increased  flexibility  obtained
from the use of AHAs has been shown to
persist even in low-humidity situations.49
A thinner, more compact SC is also desir-
able because it better reflects light, making
the skin appear more luminous.48

A  thinner  SC,  however,  does  have
some  purported  disadvantages.  For
instance,  exfoliants  have  been  demon-
strated  to  lower  the  minimal  erythema
dose (MED) of the skin.50 Although one
study  showed 
that  glycolic  acid
imparted  a  photoprotective  effect,51 all
subsequent  studies  have 
revealed
increased photosensitivity following the
application  of  AHAs.52,53 The  FDA  has
reviewed  the  research  on  AHAs  and
now  requires  that  these  products
include  a  label  warning  that  they  be
used in conjunction with sun protection.

Lactic Acid

Lactic acid is unique because it is an AHA
as well as a component of the NMF. This
means that it confers the same benefit as
other  AHAs  by  promoting  desquama-
tion, but offers other beneficial effects as
well. The benefits of lactic acid on pho-
toaged  skin  are  well  understood,  as
demonstrated by a double-blind vehicle-
controlled  study  that  found  that  an  8% 
L-lactic  acid  formula  was  superior  to
vehicle  for  the  treatment  of  photoaged

skin.  Statistically  significant  improve-
ments  were  seen  in  skin  roughness  and
signs of photodamage (mottled hyperpig-
mentation  and  sallowness).54 However,
the benefits of lactic acid in dry skin are
just being elucidated. This AHA was first
used  in  1943  for  the  treatment  of
ichthyosis.55 Lactic  acid  (especially  the 
L-isomer)  has  been  found  in  vitro and 
in  vivo to  increase  the  production  of
ceramides  by  keratinocytes.39,56 In  addi-
tion, application of the L-isomer of lactic
acid  to  keratinocytes  not  only  increased
the  ceramide  content  but  appeared  to
increase the ratio of ceramide 1 linoleate
to  ceramide  1  oleate.  This  is  likely  an
important finding because a reduced ratio
of  ceramide  1  linoleate  to  ceramide  1
oleate  is  seen  in  diseases  such  as  atopic
dermatitis  and  acne.57,58 The  increased
levels of ceramides, particularly ceramide 1
linoleate,  may  partly  explain  why
patients  treated  with  the  L-isomer  of
lactic  acid  exhibited  an  improved  water
barrier with less TEWL after a surfactant
patch test than did patients treated with
vehicle alone. The effect of lactic acid on
epidermal turnover is dependent on both
pH and concentration. It has been shown
that  at  a  fixed  lactic  acid  concentration
the pH is the influential factor in epider-
mal  turnover,  while  at  fixed  pH  the
desquamation  of  the  skin  is  dependent
on lactic acid concentration.59

Propylene Glycol 

Propylene  glycol  (PG)  is  an  odorless  li-
quid that functions as both a humectant
and  an  occlusive.  It  displays  antimicro-
bial and keratolytic activity. PG has been
shown  to  enhance  the  penetration  of
drugs  such  as  minoxidil  and  steroids.
Although PG is known to be a weak sen-
sitizer itself, it may contribute to contact
dermatitis by enhancing penetration by
other allergens.60

EMOLLIENTS

These are substances added to cosmetics
to  soften  and  smooth  the  skin.  They
function  by  filling  the  spaces  between
desquamating  corneocytes  to  yield  a
smooth  surface.61 These  products
provide  increased  cohesion  causing  a
flattening of the curled edges of the indi-
vidual  corneocytes.32 This  leads  to  a
smoother  surface  with  less  friction  and
greater light refraction. Many emollients
function  as  humectants  and  occlusive
moisturizers  as  well.  Lanolin,  mineral
oil,  and  petrolatum  are  examples  of
occlusive ingredients that also confer an
emollient  effect.  As  suggested  above,

lanolin  has  a  reputation  as  a  common
sensitizer,  prompting  several  manufac-
turers to label their products as “lanolin
free.”  This  reputation  may  be  unwar-
ranted,  though,  as  it  is  actually  a  very
weak allergen according to Kligman.13

SKIN BARRIER COMPONENTS

For many years, studies have considered
the application of the primary skin barrier
lipid components, ceramides, cholesterol,
and fatty acids, to ameliorate skin barrier
function  and  subsequently  skin  hydra-
tion.  In  1993,  Man  et  al.  showed  that
ceramide  and  fatty  acid  together,  when
applied without cholesterol, delayed bar-
rier recovery. In addition, two other mix-
tures of cholesterol plus fatty acid, or cho-
lesterol  plus  ceramide  delayed  barrier
repair.  These  incomplete  mixtures  pro-
duced  abnormal  lamellar  bodies,  leading
to  abnormal  SC  intercellular  membrane
bilayers. In contrast, complete mixtures of
ceramide,  fatty  acid,  and  cholesterol  (all
three  main  lipid  components)  allowed
normal  barrier  recovery.62 Studies  in
young  mice  ((cid:10)10  weeks)  and  humans
(20–30  years  of  age)  have  shown  that
application  of  a  mixture  of  cholesterol,
ceramides, and essential/nonessential free
fatty  acids  (FFAs)  in  an  equimolar  ratio
allows  normal  barrier  recovery,  whereas
any 3:1:1:1 ratio of these four ingredients
accelerates  barrier  recovery.63 Currently,
the goal of the best barrier repair moistur-
izers is to supply these vital components
in  a  3:1:1:1  ratio.  Several  brands  such  as
AtoPalm, Tri Ceram, LBR Lipocream, and
Dove are designed with this intention.

COLLAGEN AND POLYPEPTIDE
INGREDIENTS

Many  expensive  moisturizers  contain
collagen and some manufacturers claim
that  the  collagen  in  such  formulations
can replace the collagen lost during the
aging process. This claim is unfounded,
however,  because  most  of  the  collagen
“extracts”  have  a  molecular  weight 
of  15,000  to  50,000  daltons.  Only
substances  with  a  molecular  weight  of
5000  daltons  or  less  can  penetrate  the
SC.4 The  popularity  of  these  products
may stem from the fact that the collagen
and  other  hydrolyzed  proteins  and
polypeptides  that  they  contain  leave  a
film on the skin that fills in surface irreg-
ularities. This is very similar to the way
that  hair  conditioners  work.  Once  the
product  dries,  the  protein  films  shrink
slightly causing a subtle stretching out of
fine skin wrinkles. Of course, this effect

is  temporary but  can  be  enhanced  with
the  addition  of  humectants  to  further
temporarily plump out the tiny wrinkles.
These  products  are  usually  labeled  as
firming  creams  as  well  as  moisturizers,
although they have little to no effect on
TEWL.

HYALURONIC ACID

Hyaluronic  acid  (HA)  is  a  hygroscopic
sugar that can bind over 1000 times its
weight in water. It is the most abundant
glycosaminoglycan found in the human
dermis.  The  recent  popularity  of  HA
fillers  for  injection  into  the  dermis  to
correct wrinkles has led to a plethora of
HA-containing moisturizers on the mar-
ket. HA functions as a humectant on the
skin’s  surface.  Contrary  to  many  mar-
keting  claims,  it  cannot  penetrate  the
epidermis  and  enter  the  dermis  when
applied topically.64

NATURAL INGREDIENTS

Oatmeal

Wild  oats  (Avena  sativa)  have  been  used
for  over  2000  years  in  traditional  folk
medicine,  particularly  as  a  poultice  or
soak.  Whole  oat  flour  is  thought  to  be
protective in nature and to exhibit antiox-
idant  activity,  inhibit  prostaglandin  syn-
thesis,  and  display  a  cleansing  capacity.
Another oat compound, oat beta-glucan,
is  believed  to  be  immunomodulatory.
Oat  proteins  exert  various  beneficial
effects,  including  emulsifying  activity,
fat-binding  activity,  water-hydration
capacity,  low  foaming  potential,  and
antioxidant activity (courtesy of superox-
ide  dismutase).  It  is  thought  that  oat
lipids  influence  viscosity  and  pasting
properties  and  decrease  TEWL.  For
decades,  colloidal  oat  grain  suspensions
have  been  used  as  adjuncts  in  the  treat-
ment of atopic dermatitis.65 Better bene-
fits are generally seen with the use of oat
fractions than whole oatmeal,25 and col-
loidal  oatmeal  has  replaced  rolled  oats
and  oatmeals  in  skin  care  products.
Significantly, oatmeal has been shown to
have moisturizing and anti-inflammatory
properties. In a study on 12 healthy indi-
viduals,  researchers  assessing  the  anti-
inflammatory  activity  of  two  topically
applied oatmeal extracts (Avena sativa and
Avena  rhealba),  using  the  sodium  lauryl
sulfate irritation model, found that both
extracts  displayed  preventive  effects  on
skin  irritation.66 Interestingly,  oatmeal  is
one of the few botanically derived or nat-
ural  products  labeled  by  the  FDA  as  an
effective skin protectant.

Shea Butter

Used  widely  in  cosmetic  products  as  a
moisturizer, particularly as an emollient,
shea  butter  (Butyrospermum  parkii )  is  a
natural  fat  derived  from  the  shea  or
karite tree, which grows naturally across
19  African  countries.  Recent  work  has
revealed that shea butter manifests anti-
inflammatory  activity.67 Composed
mainly  of  oleic  and  stearic  acids,  shea
butter  is  also  notable  for  containing  a
higher  percentage  of  unsaponifiables
than other vegetable oils.68 Shea butter is
included and touted in various skin and
hair  care  products,  especially  high-end
skin  products,  for  conferring  rich  emol-
lient benefits, and is thought to maintain
moisture  and  to  provide  benefits  as  an
adjuvant moisturizer in the treatment of
skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis,
dry skin, acne, scars, and striae alba.

OTHER INGREDIENTS

Many  moisturizers  contain  antioxidants
such  as  vitamins  C  and  E,  coffeeberry,
green tea, and coenyme Q10. These are
popular ingredients because antioxidants
are  thought  to  reduce  the  levels  of  free
radicals  attacking  the  skin  and  related
organs, a process that is thought to con-
tribute  to  skin  aging  (see  Chapter  33).
Niacinamide  and  soy  are  also  popular
additives  in  cosmetic  moisturizers  (see
Chapter 34). Another important ingredi-
is  glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine-Cu2(cid:6)
ent 
(GHK-Cu),  a  tripeptide-copper  complex
found  in  many  moisturizers.  Glycyl-L-
histidyl-lysine  is  a  naturally-occurring
tripeptide with a high affinity to copper,
which was initially isolated from human
plasma.69 Copper  peptide  has  been
widely used for several years to enhance
wound  healing.  GHK-Cu  complex  has
also been demonstrated to enhance colla-
gen  synthesis,70,71 and  to  increase  levels
of  sulfated  proteoglycans  in  fibroblast
cultures  as  well  as  experimental  animal
wound models.71,72 In addition, it plays a
role  in  tissue  remodeling  by  increasing
the  levels  of  matrix  metalloproteinase-2
(MMP-2) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs
(TIMP-1 and TIMP-2).73 The mechanism
of  action  and  research  behind  this  com-
plex have led to its popularity in cosmetic
products.  Although  some  clinical  trials
have reported improvement of fine lines
and wrinkles with topical use of products
containing  copper  peptide,74–76 more
research  is  warranted  to  determine  the
efficacy of copper peptide as an antiaging
agent.

New products that claim to affect cal-
cium and potassium levels have entered

the market. Such formulations may play
a  role  in  maintaining  skin  barrier  func-
tion  as  fluctuations  in  Ca2(cid:6)
and  potas-
sium  levels  have  been  shown  to  influ-
ence  skin  barrier  function.77 Although
these findings are encouraging, they are
so recent that no studies evaluating the
efficacy of these products had been pub-
lished as this textbook was being com-
pleted.  New  ingredients  continuously
enter the market as companies are con-
stantly looking for the “next new thing”;
however,  clinical  trial  data  are  often
nonexistent  or  remain  unpublished  as
proprietary data by the manufacturers.

SIDE EFFECTS

Moisturizers are generally very safe, with
few reports of side effects. Allergic con-
tact dermatitis can result from the use of
preservatives,  perfumes,  solubilizers,
sunscreens,  and  other  skin  care  product
constituents. Ingredients that may lead to
contact  dermatitis  include  fragrances,
preservatives, propylene glycol,78 vitamin
E,79 and Kathon CG (see Chapters 18, 36,
and 37 for more information).

SUMMARY

While the ultimate purpose of all mois-
turizers  is  to  enhance  the  hydration
state of the SC, moisturizing ingredients
operate  in  distinctly  specific  ways.
Occlusives  coat  the  SC  and  reduce
TEWL;  humectants  attract  water  from
the atmosphere and from the underlying
epidermis, hydrating the skin; and emol-
lients  soften  and  smooth  the  skin.  In
order to recommend the products most
suited to patients’ skin, the practitioner
should  understand  the  discrete  cate-
gories  of  moisturizing  ingredients  and
how the gamut of individual and combi-
nation products work.

Depigmenting Agents

OH

Leslie Baumann, MD
Inja Bogdan Allemann, MD

Hyperpigmented lesions, whether they
are solar lentigos, freckles, or melasma,
are  the  source  of  frequent  complaints
by cosmetic patients. In addition, some
cosmetic  patients  develop  postinflam-
matory hyperpigmentation after chem-
ical  peels,  laser  treatments,  or  even
after a bout of acne. Melanin synthesis
within  melanosomes  and  their  distri-
bution  to  keratinocytes  within  the
epidermal  melanin  unit  determines 
skin  pigmentation.  Hyperpigmentation
occurs when  this  system  goes  awry
(see  Chapter  13).  But  dark  spots  and
patches  are  unacceptable  to  cosmetic
patients. For this reason, there are hun-
dreds  of  products  on  the  market  that
are  touted  as  “lightening  creams.”
Although  there  are  many  product
choices  available,  the  number  of
effective agents to treat hyperpigmen-
tation  disorders  is  relatively  small.
Unfortunately,  most  of  these  agents
require months of use for improvement
to be seen. Combination with retinoids
(Chapter  30),  sunscreens  (Chapter  29),
chemical peels (Chapter 20), and lights
or lasers (Chapter 24) may enhance the
effectiveness  of 
these  products.
Currently  available  topical  agents  used
to  treat  hyperpigmentation 
include
inhibitors,  melanosome-
tyrosinase 
transfer inhibitors, melanocyte-cytotoxic
agents,  retinoids,  peeling  agents,  and
sunscreens.  This  chapter  will  discuss
the ingredients commonly used for the
treatment of pigmentary disorders.

TYROSINASE INHIBITORS

Tyrosinase,  the  enzyme  that  controls
the  synthesis  of  melanin,  is  a  unique
product of melanocytes (Fig. 13-1). It is
considered  to  be  the  rate-limiting
enzyme for the biosynthesis of melanin
in  epidermal  melanocytes.  Therefore,
tyrosinase  activity  is  thought  to  be  a
major regulatory step in melanogenesis.
Several products on the market contain
ingredients  that  inhibit  tyrosinase  and
thus decrease melanin formation.

OH
Hydroquinone
(cid:2) FIGURE  33-1 The  chemical  structure  of
hydroquinone.

Hydroquinone

Hydroquinone (HQ) (Fig. 33-1) is used in
over-the-counter  (OTC)  products  (2%
concentration or less), prescription drugs
(4%),  and  custom  pharmacy  formula-
tions (2% to (cid:2)10%) as an ingredient to
inhibit melanin production and produce
skin  lightening.  The  cosmetic  products
are  often  labeled  as  “skin  brighteners.”
HQ also occurs naturally as an ingredient
in various plant-derived food and bever-
age  products,  such  as  vegetables,  fruits,
grains,  coffee,  tea,  beer,  and  wine.1 For
many years, HQ has been the main treat-
ment  modality  for  postinflammatory
hyperpigmentation  and  melasma.  HQ
exerts its depigmenting effect by inhibit-
ing tyrosinase and by virtue of its cyto-
toxicity to melanocytes.2 It is known to
cause  reversible  inhibition  of  cellular
metabolism by affecting both DNA and
RNA synthesis. Also, HQ is an efficient
blocker  of  tyrosinase  and  has  been
shown to decrease its activity by 90%.3
Although  useful  as  a  sole  agent,  HQ  is
often  combined  with  other  agents  such
as tretinoin, glycolic acid, kojic acid, and
azelaic acid.4

HQ  is  currently  available  as  OTC  in
2%  concentrations  and  by  prescription
in 4% concentrations. Although the 4%
concentration is more effective than the
more conventional 2% concentration, it
is more irritating and may be more likely
to lead to side effects such as skin red-
ness. Prolonged application of HQ, often
6  weeks  or  more,  is  necessary  before
any improvement becomes noticeable.

Numerous concerns about the safety
of  HQ  have  emerged  in  recent  years
and,  in  fact,  its  use  was  banned  in
Europe in 2000 for general cosmetic pur-
poses. In Asia, its use is highly regulated.
At the time that this chapter was writ-
ten,  debate  was  ongoing  in  the  United
States  as  to  whether  the  FDA  will  ban
HQ in OTC formulations. Several com-
panies  have  removed  HQ  from  their
products in anticipation of such a policy
change.  In  addition,  many  companies

with  pharmaceutical  products  contain-
ing  HQ  that  have  not  undergone  the
FDA approval process fear that the prod-
uct will soon be banned by the FDA.

Currently, only Tri-Luma™ (Galderma)
has been approved by the FDA for use in
melasma.  The  reason  for  this  recent
scrutiny is the fact that HQ is a metabo-
lite  of  benzene  and  has  potential  muta-
genic  properties.  Some  studies  have
shown that large doses of HQ delivered
systemically—not by topical application—
resulted  in  some  evidence  of  cancer  in
rats.  However,  HQ  is  detoxified  in  the
liver  in  humans,  but  metabolized  very
differently  in  rats.5,6 In  humans,  HQ  is
probably  metabolized  to  detoxified
derivatives, such as glucuronide and sul-
fate  conjugates  of  HQ.7 In  the  40  years
HQ has been on the market, no human
cases  of  cancer  have  been  attributed  to
its use. The most serious human health
effect seen in workers exposed to HQ is
pigmentation of the eye and, in a small
number  of  cases,  permanent  corneal
damage.1 The main concerns of the FDA
are the side effects associated with topi-
cal use of HQ, which can lead to a condi-
tion  called  exogenous  ochronosis.8
Ochronosis  presents  as  asymptomatic
blue-black  macules  in  the  area  of  HQ
application,  which  is  basically  a  more
permanent  form  of  hyperpigmentation.
It  usually  occurs  after  prolonged  use  of
HQ in concentrations of 4% and greater,
which are only available by prescription.
However,  ochronosis  has  also  been
reported to have resulted from the use of
2%  HQ  preparations.9 Topical  HQ
products  are  thought  to  provoke  this
disorder  by  inhibiting  the  enzyme
homogentisic  acid  oxidase  in  the  skin.
This  results  in  the  local  accumulation 
of  homogentisic  acid  that  then  poly-
merizes  to  form  ochronotic  pigment.10
Exogenous  ochronosis  seems  to  occur
more  commonly  among  patients  with
darker  skin  types.  Despite  the  wide-
spread presence of HQ, only 30 cases of
ochronosis  have  been  attributed  to  its
use in North America.6 Other side effects
like  skin  rashes  and  nail  discoloration
may  also  occur,  but  can  be  resolved  by
simply discontinuing HQ use. The inci-
dence  of  side  effects  may  also  be
decreased  through  the  use  of  lower
strengths of HQ, using a test site first to
determine  the  presence  of  allergy,  and
taking  “hydroquinone  holidays”  every 
3 months. The debate in the FDA about
the safety of HQ has increased the need
ingredients.

Many 
companies  are  performing
research  on  newer,  less  controversial
skin lighteners.

If a ban on HQ is implemented, there
is one product that would remain unaf-
fected:  Tri-Luma™.  When  the  FDA
solicited safety data on HQ several years
ago,  only  the  manufacturers  of  Tri-
Luma™  complied  and  it  has  now  been
approved  for  the  short-term  and  inter-
mittent  long-term  treatment  of  moder-
ate to severe melasma. Tri-Luma™ con-
tains  4%  HQ,  0.05%  tretinoin,  and
0.01% fluocinolone acetonide.

Aloesin

Aloesin  (Fig.  33-2) is  a  C-glycosylated
chromone  naturally  derived  from  aloe
vera. It competitively inhibits tyrosinase,
by  suppressing  both  the  hydroxylation
of  tyrosine  to  DOPA  and  oxidation  of
DOPA to DOPAchinone, and it inhibits
melanin  production  in  cultured  normal
melanocytes.11 Aloesin and a few chemi-
cally  related  chromones  have  been
demonstrated to exhibit an even stronger
inhibitory  effect  on  tyrosinase  than
arbutin  and  kojic  acid.12 Another  study
on the inhibitory effect of aloesin and/or
arbutin  (administered  4  times  a  day  for
15 days) on pigmentation in human skin
after  UV  radiation  showed  suppressed
pigmentation  by  34%  for  aloesin,  by
43.5% for arbutin, and by 63.3% for the
cotreatment  with  aloesin  and  arbutin
compared with the control group.13

Arbutin

Arbutin  (C12H16O7)  is  a  naturally-
occurring (cid:3)-D-glucopyranoside 
that
consists of a molecule of HQ bound to
glucose (Fig. 33-3). Traditionally used in
Japan, arbutin is present in the leaves of
pear  trees  and  certain  herbs,  such  as
wheat  and  bearberry.  Its  depigmenting
mechanism  involves  a  reversible  inhibi-
tion  of  melanosomal  tyrosinase  activity
rather than suppression of the expression
and  synthesis  of  tyrosinase.14 However,
the  utility  of  arbutin  as  a  depigmenting
agent is unclear. Nakajima et al. recently
reported that although tyrosinase activ-
ity  was  reduced  in  normal  human

melanocytes  treated  with  arbutin,  an
increase  of  pigmentation  occurred.15
These  results  have  not  yet  been  dupli-
cated  and  there  are  currently  no  pub-
lished  clinical  studies  evaluating  the
effects  of  arbutin  on  pigmentation
disorders.  Arbutin  serves  as  an  ingredi-
ent 
in  various  cosmetic  products.
Deoxyarbutin,  a  synthetic  derivative  of
arbutin,  has  shown  promising  in  vitro
and in vivo results with a greater inhibi-
tion of tyrosinase than the plant-derived
compound.16

Flavonoids

More  than  4000  flavonoids  have  been
identified  in  leaves,  barks,  and  flowers.
All  have  phenolic  and  pyrane  rings,  and
are  therefore  considered  benzopyrane
derivatives.17 Many  flavonoids  display
depigmenting  effects  (Table  33-1). They
are  classified  into  six  major  groups:  fla-
vanols,  flavones,  flavonols,  flavanones,
isoflavones,  and  anthocyanidins.  These
classes  differ  in  the  conjugation  of  rings
and  the  position  of  hydroxyl,  methoxy,
and  glycosidic  groups.18 Flavonoids
exhibit  antioxidant  properties  but  they
can also directly inhibit tyrosinase and act
on  the  distal  part  of  the  melanogenesis
oxidative pathway. Resveratrol (Fig. 33-4)
falls  into  the  hydroxystilbene  derivative
group of flavonoids as do oxyresveratrol
and  gnetol,  which  are  more  efficient
tyrosinase  inhibitors  than  resveratrol.19
Resveratrol  induces  depigmentation  also
by  reducing  microphthalmia-associated
transcription factor (MITF) and tyrosinase
promoter  activity—a  pathway  that  will
be described in more detail below.20

In a recent study aimed at developing
a  skin  whitening  agent,  investigators
assessed the inhibitory effects on tyrosi-
nase of 285 different herbal extracts, and
found  that  Ramulus  mori extracts  per-
formed optimally. This extract contains
2-oxyresveratrol  and  showed  strong
inhibition of tyrosinase activity, as well
as melanin synthesis in B-16 melanoma
cells, and caused no toxicity or irritation
in various animal tests.21

Ellagic acid is isolated from strawber-
ries,  green  tea,  eucalyptus,  and  gerani-
ums. It is a tyrosinase inhibitor and has
been shown to prevent UV-induced pig-

GENTISIC ACID Gentisic acid (Fig. 33-5) is
derived from genetian roots. It has been
tested in vitro and in cell cultures prov-
ing  its  inhibitory  effect  on  tyrosinase.
However, methyl gentisate seems to be
more effective than the free acid. In vitro
studies have shown HQ to be less effec-
tive and more cytotoxic to melanocytes
than methyl gentisate.23

Hydroxycoumarins

Coumarins  are  lactones  of  phenyl-
propanoid  acid  with  an  H-benzopyra-
none  nucleus.  They  directly  interact
with tyrosinase. A Japanese group stud-
ied  the  antimelanogenic  activity  of  six
hydrocoumarins  and  alpha-tocopherol
in  normal  human  melanocytes.  In
particular,  7-allyl-6-hydroxy-4,4,5,8-
tetramethylhydrocoumarin 
(hydro-
coumarin 4) strongly inhibited melano-
genesis  and  intracellular  glutathione
(GSH)  synthesis  in  normal  human
melanocytes.  The  investigators  sug-
gested  that  hydrocoumarin  4  may  be
effective  in  preventing  hyperpigmen-
tation  and  proposed  a  combined 
treatment of hydrocoumarins and alpha-
tocopherols to enhance the hypopigment-
ing  effect  by  a  free  radical-scavenging
mechanism.24

Kojic Acid

Kojic acid (5-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-
(cid:6)-pyrone or C6H6O4) (Fig. 33-6) is a fun-
gal  metabolite  commonly  produced  by
various species of Aspergillus, Acetobacter,
and  Penicillium.25 It  is  widely  used  as  a
food  additive  for  preventing  enzymatic
browning  and  to  promote  reddening  of
unripe  strawberries.26  Kojic  acid  sup-
presses  tyrosinase  activity,  mainly  by
chelating copper. This leads to a whiten-
ing  effect  on  the  skin.27 Consequently,
manufacturers,  particularly  in  Japan,
have  used  it  extensively  in  cosmetic
agents.2828 When  used  in  cosmetic  prod-
ucts,  kojic  acid  enhances  the  product’s
shelf  life  through  its  preservative  and
antibiotic actions.29 This stability is one
of  the  advantages  of  kojic  acid  when
compared  to  HQ  and  other  depigment-
ing  agents.30 In  two  separate  studies,

kojic  acid  combined  with  glycolic  acid
was  shown  to  be  more  effective  when
compared  with  10%  glycolic  acid  and
4%  HQ  for  the  treatment  of  hyperpig-
mentation.31,32 A study by Lim compared
the  effect  of  a  gel  containing  10%  gly-
colic acid and 2% HQ with and without
2% kojic acid.33 The result was that the
addition  of  kojic  acid  to  the  gel  further
improved melasma.

Products  that  contain  kojic  acid  are
usually used twice daily for 1 to 2 months
or  until  the  patient  achieves  the  desired
effect. Unfortunately, kojic acid has been
associated  with  contact  allergy  and  is
considered  to  have  a  high  sensitizing
potential.34 Because  preparations  using
2.5%  concentrations  of  kojic  acid  have
resulted  in  facial  dermatitis,35 a  concen-
tration of 1% is usually used. However,
there  have  been  reports  of  sensitization
to 1% creams as well.34 Since it has been
extensively  used  in  foods,  there  have
been  many  reports  on  its  oral  safety.
Toxicity resulting from an oral dose has
been reported in a recent Japanese study
recording the occurrence of hepatocellu-
in  p53-deficient  mice.36

Furthermore,  convulsions  may  occur  if
kojic acid is injected.30 Lee et al. recently
reported on derivatives of kojic acid dis-
playing  increased  efficiency  through
increased penetration into the skin.37

Licorice Extract

Glabridin (Glycyrrhiza glabra) (Fig. 33-7) is
the  main  ingredient  of  licorice  extract
that  affects  skin.  Gl.  glabra extract  has
been  used  to  treat  dermatitis,  eczema,
pruritus,  cysts,  and  skin  irritation.38 In
addition,  Gl.  glabra has  demonstrated
antimutagenic,  anticarcinogenic,  and
tumor  suppressive  capacity  against  skin
cancer 
in  animal  models,  and  the
National  Cancer  Institute  has  formally
recognized the chemopreventive value of
its  primary  constituent  glycyrrhizin.39–41
Glabridin is used in skin lightening prod-
ucts because it inhibits tyrosinase activity
in  cell  cultures  without  affecting  DNA

DOPA staining on the large granule frac-
tion  of  these  cells  has  shown  that
glabridin  specifically  lowered  the  activi-
ties  of  T1  and  T3  tyrosinase  isozymes.

Topical  applications  of  0.5%  glabridin
have  also  been  demonstrated  to  inhibit
UVB-induced  pigmentation  and  ery-
thema  in  the  skin  of  guinea  pigs.
Furthermore, it has been shown that the
inhibition  of  superoxide  anion  produc-
tion and cyclooxygenase activity demon-
strated  the  anti-inflammatory  effects  of
glabridin  in  vitro.42 Notably,  Gl.  glabra
has  shown  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of
melasma.43 One  study  suggested  that
glabridin  exhibits  a  superior  depigment-
ing effect compared to HQ.44 In Europe,
licorice extract is widely used as an anti-
inﬂammatory  agent.45 However,  there
are no controlled clinical trials in the liter-
ature examining the efficacy of this agent
to  treat  inflammation.  Forms  of  licorice
extract have been incorporated into skin
care  products  to  prevent  inflammation.
One such ingredient is licochalcone A—
an  oxygenated  retrochalcone  that  is
found in Eucerin Redness Relief ™ prod-
ucts. Licochalone has exhibited antipara-
sitic,  antibacterial,  and  antitumorigenic
activity as well as shown efficacy in treat-
ing rosacea.17,46–50

Paper Mulberry or Mulberry Extract

Paper  mulberry 
is  also  known  as
Broussonetia  papyrifera—an  East  Asian
ornamental deciduous tree. In a study in
which 101 plant extracts were evaluated
for inhibitory activity against tyrosinase,
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine  (L-DOPA)
oxidation,  and  melanin  biosynthesis  in
B16  mouse  melanoma  cells,  investiga-
tors  noted  that  the  leaves  and  bark  of 
B.  papyrifera inhibited  both  tyrosinase
activity and L-DOPA in a concentration-
dependent  fashion.51 Although  it  dis-
plays  activity  as  a  tyrosinase  inhibitor,
there  are  currently  no  peer-reviewed
clinical  studies  evaluating  its  use  in
pigmentary disorders.

Emblicanin

Emblica  in  an  extract  from  the  edible
Phyllantus emblica fruit and is thus 100%
natural.  The  key  components  are  the
tannins emblicanin A and emblicanin B.
Emblica  combines  all  the  important

281

 
 
properties required for a skin lightening
ingredient:  It  acts  at  several  different
sites in the melanogenesis pathway, not
only as an inhibitor of tyrosinase and/or
tyrosinase-related  proteins  (TRP-1  and
2)  and  peroxidase/H2O2,52 but  also  as  a
broad-spectrum  cascading  antioxidant
(Fig.  33-8). Emblica  is  thought  to  have
efficacy  comparable  to  HQ  and  kojic
acid,  but  without  provoking  similarly
harmful  side  effects.  It  is  photochemi-
cally  and  hydrolytically  stable,  which
facilitates  its  inclusion  in  skin  care
formulations.

MELANOSME-TRANSFER
INHIBITORS

Niacinamide

Niacinamide,  also  known  as  nicoti-
namide, is the biologically active amide
of  vitamin  B3 (Fig.  33-9). Niacinamide
has  been  shown  to  exhibit  anti-inflam-
matory, antioxidant, and immunomodu-
latory properties. In addition, it has been
demonstrated  to  inhibit  the  transfer
of melanosomes  to  epidermal  ker-
atinocytes. Clinical trials have shown its
ability  to  inhibit  melanosome  transfer
by up to 68% in an in vitro model and
improve  unwanted  facial  pigmenta-

tion.53 Significant  effects  on  hyperpig-
mentation have been demonstrated by a
5% niacinamide formulation used twice
daily  for  8  weeks  and  by  3.5%  niaci-
namide  in  combination  with  retinyl
palmitate.54 The effects on pigmentation
have been shown to be reversible.55 Like
licorice  extract,  niacinamide  is  also  an
effective  anti-inflammatory  ingredient
(Chapter  35).  Niacinamide  is  found  in
Olay Total Effects, Olay Regenerist, and
Olay  Definity  skin  care  lines.  NIA24™
products  have  an  ingredient  similar  to
niacinamide.

Soy

The  soybean  plant  belongs  to  the  pea
family, Leguminosae. Soy is found in tofu
products  as  well  as  in  soybeans  and
soymilk.  Chinese  folklore  suggests  that
Chinese  women  who  work  in  the  tofu
industry  have  beautiful  skin.56 As  the
health  benefits  of  soy  have  become

known, it has been added to many skin
care products.

The  PAR-2,  a  G-protein-coupled
receptor, has been found to regulate the
ingestion  of  melanosomes  by  ker-
atinocytes  in  culture57 (see  Chapter  13).
Paine  et  al.  demonstrated  that  soymilk
and 
the  soymilk-derived  proteins,
namely,  soybean  trypsin  inhibitor  (STI)
and the Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI), are
able to inhibit PAR-2 activation and thus
induce  skin  depigmentation.58 As  the
inhibition  of  melanosome  transfer  is
reversible, side effects are negligible with
a superb safety profile. The depigment-
ing  activity  of  these  agents  and  their
capacity to prevent UV-induced pigmen-
tation  has  been  demonstrated  both 
in  vitro and  in  vivo.  In  these  studies,
dark-skinned  Yucatan  microswine  were
treated  with  soybean  extract.  Dimi-
nished skin color was observed visually
and confirmed by F&M staining of histo-
logic sections that demonstrated reduced
melanin  deposition  in  the  skin  biopsies
of  treated  skin.  Interestingly,  the  effect
was  seen  only  with  fresh  soymilk  and
not  seen  when  pasteurized  soymilk
preparations  were  used.  This  suggests
that  a  heat-labile  component  of  the
soymilk, STI, is the active depigmenting
agent.  Treatments  with  soymilk  were

human trials have demonstrated lighten-
ing of pigmented spots after application

A recent study examined the efficacy
of  a  novel  soy  moisturizer  containing
nondenaturated STI and BBI on pigmen-
tation, the improvement of skin tone, and
additional  photoaging  characteristics.
Sixty-five  women,  aged  30  to  61  with
Fitzpatrick phototypes I to III, with mod-
erately  severe  mottled  hyperpigmenta-
tion, lentigines, blotchiness, tactile rough-
ness, and  dullness  were  enrolled  in  the
parallel,  randomized,  double-blind,  and
vehicle-controlled  study.  The  moistur-
izer  and  the  vehicle,  respectively,  were
administered twice daily for a period of
12  weeks.  By  clinical  observation,  self-
assessment, colorimetry, and digital pho-
tography,  the  researchers  could  show  a
significant improvement of mottled pig-
mentation,  blotchiness,  dullness,  fine
lines,  overall  texture,  overall  skin  tone,
and overall appearance, versus the vehi-
cle.60 In addition to these depigmentation
properties,  soy  contains  isoflavones,
which  have  antioxidant  properties  and
have  been  found  to  confer  cancer-pre-
venting benefits (see Chapter 34). 

MELANOCYTE-CYTOTOXIC
AGENTS

Azelaic Acid
Azelaic  acid  (Azelex™,  Finacea®)  (Fig. 
33-10) is  a  naturally-occurring  saturated
dicarboxylic acid that has been shown to
be  a  useful  adjunct  in  the  treatment  of
postinflammatory  pigment  alteration
(PIPA).  While  several  review  articles
focus on the use of topical azelaic acid in
the  management  of  hyperpigmentary
skin  disorders  and  the  associated  pro-
posed mechanism(s) of action of azelaic
acid,61,62 how azelaic acid exerts its clini-
cal  effect  is  not  fully  understood.  The
effect of azelaic acid appears to be attrib-
uted  to  its  ability  to  inhibit  the  energy
production  and/or  DNA  synthesis  of
hyperactive melanocytes, and partially to
its  antityrosinase  activity.63 In  addition,
as  it  has  been  reported  that  hyperpig-
mentation  and  lentigo  maligna  may  be
related pathogenetically to reactive oxy-
gen  species,  the  clinical  effectiveness  of

azelaic acid is thought to be due in part to
its inhibitory action on neutrophil-gener-
ated reactive oxygen species, leading to a
reduction both in oxidative tissue injury
at  sites  of  inflammation  and  in  melanin
formation.64 Research  has  demonstrated
that in vitro azelaic acid is a scavenger of
hydroxyl radicals and inhibits oxyradical
toxicity  in  cell  cultures.65,66 Further  in
vitro studies have demonstrated that aze-
laic  acid  is  a  competitive  inhibitor  of
tyrosinase,67 the key enzyme for melano-
genesis,  and  a  reversible  inhibitor  of
cytochrome-P450 reductase  activity  and
5(cid:7)-reductase in microsomal preparations
supplemented  with  reduced  nicoti-
namide  adenine  dinucleotide  phosphate
(NADPH).68 The capacity of azelaic acid
to reversibly inhibit the activity of mito-
chondrial  respiratory  chain  enzymes,
such  as  reduced  NADH-dehydrogenase,
succinic  acid  dehydrogenase,  and
reduced  ubiquinone  cytochrome-c oxi-
doreductase,69 and to inhibit the synthe-
sis of DNA,70 responsible for an antipro-
liferative  effect,  also  appears  to  be
important in hyperpigmentary disorders.
Azelaic  acid  has  been  reported  to  be
even more effective than topical HQ for
patients  with  melasma,  without  the  lat-
ter’s  side  effects.63,71,72 In  a  multicenter,
randomized trial lasting 24 weeks, azelaic
acid  20%  cream  produced  significantly
greater decreases in pigmentary intensity
than did its vehicle both subjectively and
in  the  chromameter  analysis.73 Another
study demonstrated that the combination
of  azelaic  acid  20%  cream  and  glycolic
acid 15% or 20% lotion is as effective as
4% HQ cream in the treatment of hyper-
pigmentation  in  darker-skinned  patients,
with  only  a  slightly  higher  rate  of  mild
local irritation.74 In yet another study, in
which  hyperpigmented  lesions  visible
only with a UVB camera were evaluated,
results  showed  that  azelaic  acid  is  supe-
rior to glycolic acid in attenuating the sub-
clinical  hyperpigmentation  when  used
over  a  3-week  period.59 In  the  United
States, topical azelaic acid is available by
prescription  in  concentrations  of  a  15%
gel and a 20% cream for the treatment of
rosacea  and  acne,  respectively.  The  use
for  hyperpigmentation 
is  off-label.
Topically applied azelaic acid is well toler-
ated,  with  adverse  effects  generally  lim-
ited  to  mild  local  cutaneous  irritation.
Azelaic acid is an excellent alternative for
patients who cannot tolerate HQ.

action  is  unknown;  however,  mequinol
is a substrate to tyrosinase and acts as a
competitive  inhibitor  of  melanogene-
sis.75 Notably, 2% mequinol with 0.01%
tretinoin has been proven to be effective
in  the  treatment  of  solar  lentigines.76,77
In a randomized, parallel-grouped, dou-
ble-masked study with 216 subjects, the
effects of 2% mequinol/0.01% tretinoin
were compared with those of 3% HQ in
the treatment of solar lentigines. With a
twice-daily treatment for more than 16
weeks and a follow-up after 24 weeks, a
significantly  higher  proportion  of  sub-
jects  achieved  clinical  success  with  2%
mequinol/0.01%  tretinoin  compared
with 3% HQ.78

Monobenzone

The monobenzyl ether in HQ is the sub-
stance  used  to  cause  permanent  depig-
mentation of normal skin. It is often used
in vitiligo patients to permanently depig-
ment the skin surrounding depigmented
areas when repigmentation is not feasi-
ble and the depigmented areas are disfig-
uring.  Monobenzone  (Fig.  33-12)
is
metabolized  inside  cells  into  quinine,
which  acts  by  permanently  damaging
the melanocytes.79 It is usually prepared
at a concentration of 20%. Brand names
include  Monobenzon,  Dermochinona,
Leucodinine,  Carmifal,  Depigman,
Superlite, and Pigmex. It is applied 2 or 3
times  daily  on  pigmented  skin,  with
depigmentation  beginning  around  6  to
12 months of treatment. Transfer of the
agent can occur to anyone who touches
the  medication;  therefore,  contact  with
others  should  be  avoided  for  up  to  3
hours  after  application.80 Potential  side
effects  include  contact  dermatitis,  con-
junctival  melanosis,  skin  lightening  in
untreated  areas,81 the  possibility  of  an
unwanted  repigmentation  starting  from

follicular melanocytes, and the need for
lifelong  total  photoprotection.  Because
this agent is cytotoxic to melanocytes, it
must be stressed that after depigmenta-
tion  therapy  with  this  agent,  future
attempts  at  repigmentation  treatment
will be completely ineffective.

N-Acetyl-4-S-cysteaminylphenol

N-Acetyl-4-S-cysteaminylphenol  is  a
melanocytotoxic  agent  consisting  of
phenolic  and  catecholic  compounds
with potent depigmenting properties. A
study 
in  which  12  patients  with
melasma  were  treated  with  a  daily
application  of  4%  N-acetyl-4-S-
cysteaminylphenol  showed  significant
reduction  in  pigmentation,  with  results
being  visible  as  early  as  2  to  4  weeks
after therapy.82

ANTIOXIDANTS

Antioxidants  are  popular  additives  in
skin  care  preparations  for  several  rea-
sons. In addition to exhibiting antiaging,
anticarcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory
activities,  they  may  also  decrease  pig-
mentation that occurs after exposure to
UV  light.83 This  may  be  useful  in  the
treatment  of  melasma.  Research  on
vitiligo  has  shown  that  antioxidants
may affect melanin production. A com-
parison  of  normal  melanocytes  with
melanocytes  from  vitiligo  patients  has
demonstrated  lower  catalase  activity
and  higher  vitamin  E  and  ubiquinone
levels in the vitiligo patients suggesting
that an imbalance in the antioxidant sta-
tus and increase in the intracellular per-
levels  could  play  a  role  in
oxide 
vitiligo.84
In  addition,  antioxidants,
including  GSH,  a  naturally-occurring
antioxidant 
regulating
involved 
melanin  synthesis,85 have  been  shown
to inhibit or delay hyperpigmentation.86
In support of these findings, a study by
Yokozawa    and  Kim86 demonstrated
that an antioxidant, piceatannol (PICE),
could  inhibit  mushroom  tyrosinase.
PICE  (Fig.  33-13) is  a  phenolic  com-
pound  derived  from  resveratrol,  which

is  found  in  grapes  and  red  wine.  It  has
antioxidative,  antitumorigenic,  and
apoptosis-inducing  effects.  In  this
study,  investigators  found  that  PICE
inhibited melanogenesis and displayed
potent  antioxidant  properties.  The
authors concluded that the antioxidant
activity  played  a  major  role  in  the
inhibition  of  melanin  production.
However,  some  studies  have  shown
that  some  antioxidants  increase  skin
pigmentation, so the individual proper-
ties of each antioxidant should be con-
sidered  before  using  them  to  decrease
skin pigmentation.87

Inflammation  has  long  been  known
to lead to skin pigmentation, especially
in  darker  skin  types.  Prostaglandins,
which  are  produced  during  inflamma-
tion, may play a role in skin pigmenta-
tion.  Indeed,  this  may  be  one  of  the
mechanisms  by  which  inflammation
can  exacerbate  melasma.  Maeda  et  al.
proposed  that  trans-4-aminomethylcy-
clohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-AMCHA
or tranexamic acid), a plasmin inhibitor,
decreases  tyrosinase  activity  in  the
melanocytes  via  reduction  in  prosta-
glandin  synthesis,  thereby  preventing
UV-induced  pigmentation  in  guinea
pigs.  Localized  intradermal  microinjec-
tions of tranexamic acid have been used
in  an  Asian  study  with  some  success.88
However,  more  studies  are  needed  to
determine the efficacy and safety of this
treatment.

Latanoprost  and  Bimatoprost,  ana-
logues  of  prostaglandin  F2(cid:7) (PGF2(cid:7)),  are
used  as  intraocular  pressure-lowering
drugs. Their use has been associated with
pigment changes of the iris and the eye-
lid.  Recently,  these  prostaglandin  ana-
logues have become popular for stimulat-
ing  eyelash  growth.  However,  these
should  be  used  with  caution  by  those
with darker skin types and those with a
history of melasma and other pigmenta-
tion  disorders.  PGF2 was  shown  to
increase  tyrosinase  activity,  suggesting
that  prostaglandins  may  stimulate
melanin  formation.89 Antioxidants  can
prevent the formation of prostaglandins,90
thereby  preventing  inflammation  and
tyrosinase activation.

Inflammation may also play a role in
skin pigmentation through the effects of
histamine.  Histamine  is  released  from
mast cells during inflammation and has
been  found  to  increase  the  level  of
tyrosinase-mediated  cAMP  via  actions
on  protein  kinase  A  (PKA).  The  release
of  histamine  stimulates  melanogenesis
and results in the production of eumel-
anin rather than pheomelanin.91 Thus, a
possible  approach  to  prevent  postin-

flammatory  hyperpigmentation  and
other  pigmentation  disorders  might  be
to block histamine action. Yoshida et al.
found  that  blocking  H2  receptors  with
famotidine  suppressed  the  increase  in
melanogenesis,  but  antagonists  of  H1
and  H3  do  not  have  any  effect.92 The
effect of histamine-related agents is dif-
ficult  to  predict  and  their  use  to  treat
hypo-  and  hyperpigmentation  is  still
unreliable. However, antioxidants, espe-
cially  flavonoids,  have  been  shown  to
inhibit histamine release.93 Antioxidants
likely  prevent  inflammation  and  subse-
quent  pigmentation  by  several  other
mechanisms  including  effects  on  tran-
scription  factor  nuclear  factor-(cid:8)B  (NF-
(cid:8)B),  inducible  nitric  oxide  synthase
expression,  and  inhibition  of  cyclooxy-
genase.94

In spite of the many cited reasons to
use  antioxidants  and  free  radical  scav-
engers  as  hypopigmenting  agents,  the
indiscriminate  use  of  these  compounds
should  be  weighed  with  caution.  Each
antioxidant and its effects should be con-
sidered  separately  and  it  should  not  be
assumed that all antioxidants will inhibit
melanogenesis. In fact, an opposite effect
seems to be possible in some cases and
unexpected  hyperpigmentation  can
occur. For example, quercetin, an extract
of  onion,  is  a  tyrosinase  inhibitor  in
vitro95;  however,  this  flavonol  has  been
described as a strong inductor of melano-
genesis in normal and malignant human
melanocytes,96 and  in  reconstituted
three-dimensional  human  epidermis
models.97 Glycyrrhizin, another popular
antioxidant  that  is  frequently  used  to
inhibit  tyrosinase,  has  been  shown 
to  stimulate  melanogenesis  in  B16
melanoma  cells.98 Clinical  trials  of  each
individual antioxidant agent, and combi-
nations  of  agents,  are  warranted  before
one can feel confident of their ability to
inhibit melanogenesis.

Vitamin C

Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (Fig. 33-14)
can be found in citrus fruits and green
leafy  vegetables.  It  inhibits  melanin 
formation  and 
reduces  oxidized 
melanin  because  it  is  able  to reduce

o-DOPAquinone  back  to  DOPA,  thus
avoiding  melanin  formation.99 Multiple
topical  preparations  contain  vitamin  C;
however,  many  of  these  products  have
problems  with  stability  and  their  utility 
is  questionable.  Companies  like  Skin-
ceuticals and La Roche-Posay have devel-
oped  stabilized  vitamin  C  preparations,
in  a  manner
which  are  packaged 
intended to minimize inactivation of this
easily  degraded  ingredient.  Specifically,
the  packaging  of  these  products  limits
UV and air exposure from rapidly oxidiz-
ing  vitamin  C.  Magnesium-L-ascorbyl-2-
phosphate  (VC-PMG)  is  a  stable  deriva-
tive  of  ascorbic  acid.  One  study
examining the effects of topically applied
VC-PMG  on  patients  with  melasma  or
senile lentigos demonstrated a significant
lightening  effect  in  19  of  34  patients.100
However,  percutaneous  absorption  of
magnesium  ascorbyl  phosphate  is  mar-
ginal  because  it  is  a  charged  molecule,
making it difficult to traverse the stratum
corneum.  In  addition  to  its  utility  as  a
depigmenting  agent,  vitamin  C  has
antioxidant  properties  and  has  been
shown  to  stimulate  collagen  synthesis
(see Chapter 34). In a randomized, double-
blind,  placebo-controlled  study,  investi-
gators used iontophoresis to enhance the
penetration  of  vitamin  C  into  the  skin
and  significantly  decrease  pigmentation
compared to placebo.101

Vitamin E
Oral  intake  of  vitamin  E  ((cid:7)-tocopherol
or  (cid:7)-T) (Fig. 33-15) has been reported in
the Japanese literature to be effective for
the  treatment  of  facial  hyperpigmenta-
tion, especially in combination with vit-
amin  C.102,103 Studies  examining  the
effects of (cid:7)-tocopheryl ferulate (a com-
pound composed of (cid:7)-T and ferulic acid)
on  melanogenesis  in  cultured  human
melanoma cells demonstrated inhibition
of  tyrosine  hydroxylase  activity  in  an
indirect  manner.  The  researchers  found
that  this  tocopherol  derivative  was  a
stronger inhibitor of melanin formation
than arbutin and kojic acid.104 They pos-
tulated that (cid:7)-tocopheryl ferulate could
be used to ameliorate and prevent facial
hyperpigmentation induced by UV radi-
ation  by  inhibiting  tyrosinase  as  well
through antioxidant mechanisms.105

HO

O

The  depigmenting  effect  of  (cid:7)-T  was
also examined in normal human melan-
ocytes  and  investigators  showed  that 
30 μg/mL of (cid:7)-T dissolved in 150 μg/mL
of lecithin inhibited melanization signif-
icantly  without  inhibiting  cell  growth,
and  that  this  phenotypic  change  was
associated  with  the  dose-dependent
inhibition of tyrosinase.106

Tocopherol employs four homologues
((cid:7),  (cid:3),  (cid:6),  and  (cid:9))  with  differing  numbers
and  positions  of  the  methyl  groups  in 
the  chromatin  ring.  (cid:6)-Tocopherol  ((cid:6)-T)
has  been  found  to  suppress  the  expres-
sion  of  tyrosinase  melanoma  cells.107
Tocopheryl-dimethyl-glycinate (TDMG)
is a novel tocopherol derivative with the
dimethylglycine ester linked to the sixth
position  of  the  chromanoxyl  ring  of
tocopherol.108 A Japanese group reported
on  a  novel  hydrophilic  (cid:6)-T  derivative
known  as  (cid:6)-tocopheryl-N,N-di-methyl-
glycinate hydrochloride ((cid:6)-TDMG); this
derivative  converts  to  the  antioxidant 
(cid:6)-T in skin and displays greater bioavail-
ability than (cid:6)-T itself. The group exam-
ined  whether  (cid:6)-TDMG  could  reduce
UV-induced skin pigmentation in brown
guinea pigs. By topically applying 0.1%
or 0.5% (cid:6)-TDMG to the skin of brown
guinea pigs before and after exposure to
UVB  as  well  as  UVA  (3  times/wk  for 
1  week)  and  then  10  times/wk  for 
4  weeks,  the  investigators  could  show
signiﬁcant  skin  lightening  with  0.5% 
(cid:6)-TDMG  and  a  dose-dependent  inhibi-
tion of the melanin synthesis. These data
suggest  that  the  topical  application  of 
(cid:6)-TDMG may be efficacious in prevent-
ing photo-induced  skin  pigmentation  in
humans.109

Green Tea

Green  tea  is  one  of  the  most  popular
beverages  consumed  throughout  the
world.  Of  all  the  compounds  known
to  exhibit  antioxidant  activity,  green
tea polyphenols (GTPs) are associated
with  the  largest  amount  of  scientiﬁc
evidence  to  support  their  use  in  der-
matology.  Consequently,  green  tea  is
also  a  popular  ingredient  included  in
various beauty and personal care prod-
ucts,  such  as  moisturizers,  cleansers,
shower gels, toothpastes, depilatories,
shampoos,  perfumes,  and  even  soft

drinks.  Most  “green  tea-containing”
products  have  minimal  amounts  of
green tea. Products with large amounts
of  green  tea  (50%–90%  polyphenols)
have  a  tinted  brown  color.  Look  for
products  that  have  large  amounts  of
green  tea,  such  as    Replenix  brand  by
Topix.

A  special  preparation  process  of  the
tea leaves, which involves short steaming
and  prevents  any  fermentation,  ensures
the  preservation  of  the  antioxidant
polyphenols.  Four  major  polyphenolic
catechins can be isolated from the fresh
leaves  of  the  green  tea  plant  Camellia
sinensis: ECG [(–)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate],
GCG [(–)-gallocatechin-3-O-gallate], EGCG
[(–)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate],  and
EGC [(–)-epigallocatechin]110 (Fig. 33-16).
EGCG is the most studied and abundant
component  and  comprises  30%  to 
40%  of  the  dry  weight  of  green  tea
leaves.111,112

GTPs  have  been  reported  to  impart
numerous health benefits when admin-
istered either topically or orally, by dint
of  their  antioxidant,  anti-inflammatory,
and anticarcinogenic properties.113–115

With  regard  to  the  skin,  there  have
been several in vitro and in vivo studies.
GTPs  have  been  demonstrated  to
modulate biochemical pathways impor-
tant  in  cell  proliferation,  inﬂammatory
responses, and responses of tumor pro-
moters.116 These  have  also  been  found
to  be  especially  potent  at  suppressing
the carcinogenic activity of UV radiation
and  exerting  broad  protection  against
other  UV-mediated  responses  such  as
sunburn, immunosuppression, and pho-
toaging  by    inhibiting  UV  induced  ele-
ments  of  the  mitogen-activated  protein
kinase (MAPK) pathways, Ras and acti-
vator protein AP-1 and LDH activation,
as well as by the upregulation of UVA-
suppressed  GSH-Px  and  the  inhibition
of  UVB-induced  infiltration  of  inflam-
matory  cells.117 GTPs  are  thus  thought
to have the potential to protect the skin

when  used  in  combination  with  tradi-
tional sunscreens.118,119

In  a  recent  study,  EGCG  was  shown
to exhibit antiproliferative and proapop-
totic  effects  on  human  melanoma
cells.120 No et al. examined the tyrosinase
inhibitory  activity  of  mushroom  tyrosi-
nase in 10 varieties of Korean traditional
teas. Of the four major polyphenolic cat-
echins, ECG, GCG, and EGCG proved to
be  the  strongest  inhibitors  of  all.  Of
these three, GCG showed the strongest
inhibitory effect on tyrosinase, competi-
tively inhibiting the enzyme at its active
site.121 Furthermore, EGCG was demon-
strated to inhibit melanin synthesis in a
concentration-dependent manner, not by
cell  cytotoxicity  but  by  reducing  MITF
and  tyrosinase  protein  levels  in  Mel-Ab
cells  (a  mouse-derived  spontaneously
immortalized  melanocyte  cell  line  that
produces  large  amounts  of  melanin).
EGCG  displayed  a  stronger  hypopig-
menting 
acid.
Additionally,  EGCG  inhibited  mush-
room tyrosinase activity and, to a lesser
degree, human tyrosinase.122

than  kojic 

effect 

Studies  of  GTPs  in  human  skin  have
been  limited  in  comparison  to  animal
studies.  There  are  two  major  challenges
for the topical use in humans: (1) estab-
lishing a standard formulation and deliv-
ery  systems  that  ensure  the  stability  of
these  easily  oxidized  antioxidants  and 
(2)  increasing  epidermal  penetration  of
these hydrophilic agents into human skin.

Pycnogenol

Pycnogenol  is  a  standardized  pine  bark
extract  that exhibits potent antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic
activity.123–125 The  efficacy  of  pyc-
nogenol 
in  protecting  against  UV-
induced pigmentation was evaluated in
a 30-day clinical trial of 30 women with
melasma. Patients were given one 25-mg
tablet  of  pycnogenol  at  each  meal,  3
times daily. Investigators found that the
average surface area of melasma signifi-
cantly  decreased,  revealing  pycnogenol
to be an effective and safe treatment for
this condition.124 One study has demon-
strated  that  pycnogenol  is  active  when
applied  topically.  In  this  study,  hairless
mice exposed to solar-simulated ultravi-
olet  radiation  were  topically  treated,
postirradiation,  with  lotions  containing
pycnogenol.  Dose-dependent  reduc-
tions in the inflammatory sunburn reac-
tion  and 
immunosuppression  were
observed as a result of pycnogenol treat-
ment.  Tumor  formation  was  delayed
and  tumor  prevalence  was  also  signifi-
cantly  reduced  in  mice  treated  with

0.2%  pycnogenol.  Researchers  con-
cluded that topical pycnogenol displays
potential  as  a  photoprotective  comple-
ment to sunscreens, clearly evincing bio-
logic  activity  when  applied  after  UV
exposure.96 More  data  are  needed  to
determine the validity of these claims.

Silymarin

Silymarin 
is  a  naturally-occurring
polyphenolic  flavonoid  or  flavonolig-
nans compound derived from the seeds
of  the  milk  thistle  plant  Silybum  mari-
anum.126 Milk  thistle  has  been  used  for
medicinal purposes for more than 2000
years.  Today,  it  is  used  clinically  in
Europe  and  Asia  as  an  antihepatotoxic
agent and is available as a supplement in
Europe and the United States. The main
component of silymarin is silybin (silib-
inin), which is considered to be its most
biologically  active  constituent  in  terms
of  its  antioxidant,  anti-inflammatory,
and anticarcinogenic properties.91

Topical application of silybin prior to,
or immediately after, UV irradiation has
been found to impart strong protection
against UV-induced damage in the epi-
dermis  by  a  reduction  in  thymine
dimer-positive cells and an upregulation 
of  p53-p21/Cip1,  which  researchers
believe may lead to the inhibition of cell
proliferation  and  apoptosis.  This  study
suggests  that  mechanisms  other  than
sunscreen  effect  are  integral  to  silybin
efficacy  against  UV-caused  skin  dam-
age.127 Investigators have also noted that
silybin  enhances  UVB-induced  apopto-
sis and speculated that it acts as a UVB
damage  sensor  to  confer  its  biologic
action.128

The antioxidant activity of silymarin
is  well  established.  Chemoprotective
activity against skin cancer has also been
reported and continues to be the subject
of much investigation.129,130 In a study to
identify  the  mechanism  of  photocar-
cinogenesis prevention in mouse skin by
the  topical  treatment  of  silymarin,  pre-
vention  of  UVB-induced  immunosup-
pression  and  oxidative  stress  were
found  to  be  potentially  related  to  the
prevention  of  photocarcinogenesis  in
mice.131 The  authors  concluded  from
this  trial  and  related  data  from  other
recent studies that there are compelling
arguments for the inclusion of silymarin
in  sunscreens  or  in  other  products  in  a
skin  care  regimen.  Furthermore,  sily-
marin  has  been  shown  to  inhibit 
UV-induced  NF-(cid:8)B  activation  in  ker-
atinocytes.  Researchers  have  hypothe-
sized  that  the  inhibition  of  NF-(cid:8)B
activation and the consequent inhibition

of  UV-induced  inflammation  by  sily-
marin is a result primarily of the inhibi-
tion  of  UV-induced  inflammation  by
free radical scavenging and a modulation
of intracellular GSH content.132

Most of the milk thistle or silymarin
available  in  the  United  States  comes  in
the  form  of  oral  supplements.  The
extant  evidence  on  this  botanical  sug-
gests  potent  antioxidant  strength  and
great  potential  as  an  antiphotodamage,
anticarcinogenic  component 
in  an
improved  medical,  dermatologic  arma-
mentarium.  Moreover,  silymarin  may
favorably supplement sunscreen protec-
tion  and  provide  additional  antiphoto-
carcinogenic protection.133

Alpha Lipoic Acid

Also  named  thioctic  acid,  alpha  lipoic
acid and its reduced form dihydrolipoic
acid (DHLA) have both been considered
strong  antioxidants.  Alpha  lipoic  acid
(Fig. 33-17) has been called the universal
antioxidant because it is both water and
fat soluble and can thus act in the lipid
cell  membrane  and  the  aqueous  com-
partment of the cell.134 In addition, alpha
lipoic acid has been shown to inhibit the
activation of NF-(cid:8)B transcription factor,
modulating the cellular response to UV
radiation  and  preventing  UV-induced
oxidative  injury.  It  further  inhibits
tyrosinase by chelating copper and sup-
pressing  DOPAquinone-derivative  for-
mation.132 Dihydrolipoic  acid  shows
slightly stronger antioxidant activity by
reacting  with  superoxide  and  hydroxyl
radicals.135 In addition, alpha lipoic acid
elevates  intracellular  GSH  levels  by
increasing  its  de  novo synthesis, 1 3 61 3 6
which  again  reduces  UV  radiation 
sensitivity.137

Both  lipoic  and  dihydrolipoic  acids
have  been  proven  to  block  the  expres-
sion of MITF (a regulator of melanocyte
development  and  survival),138 conse-
quently inhibiting tyrosinase expression
and  activity  as  well  as  inducing  skin
lightening.20 Sodium zinc dihydrolipoyl-
histidinate  (DHLHZn),  a  compound  of
Zn2(cid:4)
/dihydrolipoic  acid  derivate  com-
plex,  seems  to  covalently  react  with
DOPAquinone,  resulting  in  a  competi-
tive  inhibitory  effect  of  DHLHZn  on
thus

potentially  serving  as  an  effective  skin-
lightening  agent.139 Lipoic  acid 
is
included  in  multiple  topical  cosmetic
formulations. However, there has been a
report  on  contact  dermatitis  to  alpha
lipoic acid.140 Further in vivo studies are
necessary  to  verify  the  above-stated
findings. In addition, a recent report has
called into question whether the topical
antioxidant  designation  is  accurate  for
alpha lipoic acid.141

OTHER AGENTS
Alpha Hydroxy Acids and 
Beta Hydroxy Acid

Alpha  hydroxy  and  beta  hydroxy  acid
peels  have  become  increasingly  preva-
lent in dermatologic practices. All AHAs
have a terminal carboxyl group with one
or two hydroxyl groups on the second or
alpha  carbon  and  a  variable  length  car-
bon  chain.142 The  two  shortest  carbon
chain acids, glycolic (2-hydroxyethanoic)
and lactic (2-hydroxypropanoic), are the
most commonly used in dermatology143
(Figs. 33-18 and 33-19). The former is a
very versatile peeling agent causing min-
imal complications and is used in various
strengths  ranging  from  20%  to  70%.
People  with  virtually  any  skin  type  can
be  candidates  for  AHA  and  BHA  peels,
including  Asian  Americans,  African
Americans,  Hispanics,  and  others  with
deeply pigmented skin144 (see Chapter 20).
Researchers  have  not  yet  completely
elucidated  the  exact  mechanism  of
action  of  AHAs  on  the  skin,  but  it
appears  that  they  exert  different  effects
on the epidermis and the dermis. In the
epidermis,  the  principal  effect  is  dimin-
ished  corneocyte  cohesion.145 This
causes  more  rapid  desquamation  of  the
pigmented keratinocytes with the inten-
tion that the newly formed keratinocytes
will contain less pigment. It also helps to
increase  the  keratinocyte  turnover  rate
thereby  shortening  the  cell  cycle.
in
it  was  shown 
Recently, 
melanoma cells alpha hydroxy acids also
directly  inhibit  tyrosinase  activity.146 In
1997, Burns et al. demonstrated that ser-
ial  glycolic  acid  peels  provide  an  addi-
tional  benefit,  with  minimal  adverse
effects, for the treatment of postinflam-

that

matory  hyperpigmentation  in  individu-
als  with  dark  complexions.147 Patients
who receive a chemical peel in addition
to  a  topical  treatment  demonstrate  a
greater and more rapid improvement of
pigmented  lesions  compared  to  topical
treatment alone with a slight lightening
of  their  normal  facial  skin  tone.148 In  a
recent  study,  lactic  acid  in  a  concentra-
tion of 92% was used to treat melasma.
Patients treated every 3 weeks for a max-
imum  of  6  times  showed  significant
improvement in their melasma area and
severity  index  (MASI)  scores.149 Lactic
acid was further shown to be as effective
in  decreasing  pigmentation  as  Jessner’s
solution.150 When  treating  PIPA  with
peels,  it  is  initially  important  to  use
lower concentrations of AHA and slowly
increase  the  strength  to  avoid  irritating
the  skin,  causing  even  more  hyperpig-
mentation.151 The  use  of  topical  HQ
preparations pre- and postpeel decreases
the chances of aggravating PIPA.

Octadecenedioic Acid

Octadecenedioic acid is a skin-whitening
agent with a similar structure to azelaic
acid. It has been demonstrated to be an
efficient skin whitener in clinical studies;
however, its mechanisms of action were
unclear at that time.152 Recently, Wiechers
et al. were able to show that the known
whitening  activity  of  octadecenedioic
acid  is  mediated  by  the  stimulation  of
the  peroxisome  proliferator-activating
receptor  (PPAR).  The  binding  to  PPAR
leads  to  reduced  melanin  production
through the reduction of the synthesis of
tyrosinase mRNA.153

PPARs  are  members  of  the  nuclear
receptor  superfamily,  regulating  impor-
tant cellular functions, including cell pro-
liferation  and  differentiation,  as  well 
as  inflammatory  responses.154 It  was
reported  that  three  subtypes  of  PPAR
(designated (cid:7), (cid:3), and (cid:6)) are expressed in
human melanocytes.155 The above-men-
tioned  study  showed  that  octadecene-
dioic  acid  is  a  PPAR-(cid:6) agonist,  with  a 
10-fold  higher  afﬁnity  for  this  receptor
than  the  other  two  PPAR  receptors.153
This suggests a novel mechanism of skin
pigmentation and consequently a novel
approach  for  the  therapy  of  skin
pigmentation disorders.

Pyruvic Acid

Pyruvic  acid  is  an  alpha-keto-acid  with
keratolytic,  antimicrobial,  and  sebosta-
tic properties in addition to the ability to
stimulate  new  collagen  production  and
elastic fiber formation. It is successfully
used in the treatment of acne.156 A treat-
ment with 50% pyruvic acid, employed
for  four  peeling  sessions  performed
every 2 weeks has been shown to effec-
tively reduce the degree of pigmentation
in  melasma  patients  and  significantly
increase  skin  elasticity  as  well  as
decrease skin wrinkling. No side effects,
such  as  persistent  erythema  or  postin-
flammatory  hyperpigmentation,  were
observed.157 Comparable  results 
in
terms  of  safety  and  efficacy  were  also
shown in 20 patients treated for moder-
ately photodamaged facial skin.158

Resorcinol

Resorcinol  (m-dihydrobenzene)  is  iso-
meric with cathecol and HQ.159 This bac-
tericidal  agent  is  soluble  in  water, ether,
and alcohol. The primary indications for
its  use  include  postinflammatory  hyper-
pigmentation  as  well  as  melasma  and
acne; secondary indications are sun-dam-
aged skin and freckles. Resorcinol should
not be used in pregnancy or in darker skin
types  (IV–VI).  Some  authors  have  men-
tioned the possibility of an allergic reac-
tion to resorcinol and suggest testing the
agent by applying it to the retroauricular
area a few days before using it as a peel.
However, until recently, predictive meth-
ods,  both  animal  and  human,  have  not
been  successful  in  identifying  resorcinol
as  a  skin  sensitizer.  A  recent  study  was
able to establish that resorcinol has a skin
sensitization  potential,  using  a  local
lymph  node  assay.160 Shimizu  et  al.
proved  that  4-substituted  resorcinols,
naturally  obtained  or  synthesized,  have
potent tyrosinase inhibitory ability.161 In
addition,  Tasaka  et  al.  showed  a  depig-
menting effect for a resorcinol derivative
with an isopentyl group in position 6 of
resorcinol (NKO-09), with a more potent
depigmenting effect than HQ by inhibit-
ing  tyrosine  hydroxylation  and  DOPA
oxidation.162

Retinoids

Several  different  substances  comprise
the  family  of  retinoids,  which  are
lipophilic vitamin A derivatives that eas-
ily penetrate the epidermis. The effect of
retinoids  on  pigmentation  seems  to
involve  various  mechanisms  not 
yet  completely  identified.  Retinoids
apparently  exert  their  depigmenting

by 

that 

directly 

inhibiting 

effects 
influencing
melanocytes  as  well  as  indirectly  by
modulating  melanogenesis.  Topical
retinoids seem to directly affect melano-
genesis via tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2
expression.163–165 Furthermore, it is sug-
gested 
the
by 
detoxiﬁcation  of  toxic  species,  retinoic
acid  enhances  the  melanocytotoxic
effect of depigmenting agents. By accel-
erating  the  cell  turnover  of  epidermal
keratinocytes, topical retinoids promote
a  decrease  in  melanosome  transfer  to
the keratinocytes and induce dispersion
of  keratinocyte  pigment  granules  lead-
ing to a uniform distribution of melanin
content  in  the  epidermis.  More  rapid
epidermal  turnover  also  reduces  the
cohesiveness  of  corneocytes  and  thus
induces  desquamation 
that  conse-
quently  leads  to  an  accelerated  loss  of
melanin  in  the  stratum  corneum.166
Indirectly,  the  changes  engendered  in
the  stratum  corneum  may  facilitate  the
penetration  of  other/additional  depig-
menting  agents  into  the  epidermis  and
increase  their  bioavailability,  thereby
leading to increased depigmentation.

Tretinoin 

(Retin-A™,  Renova™,
Avita™)  in  concentrations  of  0.05%  to
0.1% is another agent used to treat PIPA.
It is frequently employed as an adjuvant
in the treatment of pigmentation disor-
ders  even  though  the  mechanism  of
action  is  not  completely  understood.
Part of the effect is based on the stimula-
tion  of  the  cell  turnover  of  epidermal
keratinocytes,  which  promotes  a
decrease  in  melanosome  transfer  and
accelerates  the  loss  of  melanin  via  epi-
dermopoiesis.  Although  studies  have
shown retinoic acid to inhibit the induc-
tion  of  tyrosinase,  and  subsequently
melanogenesis, in mouse melanoma cell
cultures,167 animal studies have demon-
strated  that  topical  application  of
retinoic  acid  can  increase  melanogene-
sis.168,169 Nevertheless,  clinical  trials
have  shown  tretinoin  to  be  efficacious
for the treatment of melasma.170,171

The 

topical 

retinoid 

tazarotene
(Avage™,  Tazorac™)  has  also  been
shown  to  improve  irregular  hyperpig-
mentation associated with photoaging.172
Adapalene  (Differin  Gel™  0.1%  and
0.3%) is a potent synthetic retinoid. In a
randomized 
trial,  adapalene  0.1%
showed the same effect on reduction in
MASI  as  0.05%  tretinoin,  yet  the
patients treated with adapalene had sig-
nificantly  fewer  side  effects.173 Oral
0.05%  isotretinoin  has  exhibited  clini-
cally important but not statistically sig-
nificant  results  in  a  randomized  trial
treating Thai patients with melasma.174

The side effects of retinoids, such as
dryness, irritation, and scaling, are signs
of a damaged skin barrier.175 This condi-
tion  allows  for  other  agents  to  more
readily  penetrate  into  the  skin  and
enhance  their  efficacy,  as  is  the  case
with HQ, which often is used in combi-
nation  with  retinoids.  It  is  advisable  to
add a corticosteroid to retinoid therapy
to  mitigate  irritation.  First  proposed  by
Kligman  in  1975,  the  combination  con-
sisting  of  0.1%  tretinoin,  5%  HQ,  and
0.1%  dexamethasone  was  named  the
Kligman formula and has been the most
widely  used  combination  formula  to
treat  melasma.176 There  are  numerous
additional  combination  treatments  in
use. (see Chapter 30 for more informa-
tion on retinoids.)

Sunscreen

Sun  protection  also  plays  a  role  in  the
treatment  of  pigmentary  disorders.  UV
radiation  stimulates  the  synthesis  of
melanin and promotes the transfer of pig-
ments from melanocytes to keratinocytes
thereby increasing pigmentation. The use
of a broad-spectrum sunscreen has been
shown  to  improve  melasma,174 and
should  be  a  part  of  any  skin-lightening
regimen. (see Chapter 29 for a discussion
of the different types of sunscreens.)

SUMMARY

The process of skin pigmentation is very
complex, and more research is necessary
to  elucidate  this  integral  aspect  of  skin
and  cosmetic  dermatology.  Tyrosinase
inhibition has so far been the most com-
mon approach to treat disorders of pig-
mentation, but only a small selection of
tyrosinase  inhibitors  have  practical
applications  owing 
formulation
issues, stability, irritation, and ability to
penetrate  into  the  skin.  Pigmentation
disorders  are  a  frustrating  problem  for
many cosmetic patients. Manufacturers
have  responded  by  making  several
depigmenting  agents  available  in  both
prescription  and  OTC  preparations.
These  agents  seem  to  work  best  when
used in combination.

THE FREE RADICAL
THEORY OF AGING

The  free  radical  theory  of  aging,  pro-
posed by Harman in 1956,1 is one of the
most  widely  accepted  theories  to
explain the cause of aging.2 Free radicals,
also  known  as  reactive  oxygen  species
(ROS),  are  compounds  formed  when
oxygen  molecules  combine  with  other
molecules  yielding  an  odd  number  of
electrons.  An  oxygen  molecule  with
paired electrons is stable; however, oxy-
gen  with  an  unpaired  electron  is  “reac-
tive”  because  it  seeks  and  seizes  elec-
trons  from  vital  components  leaving
them damaged.3 DNA, cytoskeletal ele-
ments,  cellular  proteins,  and  cellular
membranes  may  all  be  adversely
affected  by  activated  oxygen  species.4
ROS  have  not  only  been  implicated  in
the  overall  aging  process,5 but  are
believed  to  be  involved  cutaneously  in
causing photoaging, carcinogenesis, and
inflammation. It is known that ultravio-
let (UV)-induced damage to the skin is in
part mediated by reactive oxygen inter-
mediates.6 If  antioxidants  can  absorb
some of the resulting free radicals, they
may  be  able  to  mitigate  UV-induced
damage  to  the  skin.  Free  radicals  may
also  lead  to  inflammation,  which  is
believed  to  play  a  role  in  skin  aging.6
Lipid  peroxidation,  another  sequela  of
free  radical  production,  causes  harm  to
cell  membranes  and  can  lead  to  skin
aging, atherosclerosis, and other signs of
aging.  Free  radicals  are  also  thought  to
contribute  to  the  development  of  skin
cancer. There are multiple studies in the
literature describing the role of free radi-
cals  and  skin  cancer.  The  exact  mecha-
nisms for all of the detrimental effects of
free  radicals  have  not  been  completely
elucidated, however.

Free  radicals  also  play  an  important
role in intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging.
They are formed naturally through nor-
mal human metabolism, but can be pro-
duced  as  a  result  of  exogenous  factors,
such  as  UV  exposure,  air  pollution,
smoking,  radiation,  alcohol  use,  exer-
cise, inflammation, and exposure to cer-
tain drugs or heavy metals such as iron.
In  fact,  UV  radiation,  stress,  cigarette

(NF-(cid:8)B).7

smoke, pollution, drugs, and diet can be
sources  of  ROS  such  as  superoxide,
hydroxyl  anion,  hydrogen  peroxide
(H2O2), and singlet oxygen. Recent data
suggest  that  free  radicals  can  induce  a
number of transcription factors, such as
activator  protein-1  (AP-1)  and  nuclear
factor-(cid:8)B 
Further,  ROS
increase the expression of matrix metal-
loproteinases (MMPs), specifically colla-
genase, which has the ability to degrade
skin  collagen.8,9 Collagenase  formation
occurs  as  a  result  of  the  activation  of
transcription  factors  c-Jun  and  c-Fos,
which  combine  to  produce  the  AP-1
that, in turn, prompts the activity of the
MMPs.10 Additionally, the mitogen-acti-
vated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is
also  a  target  of  oxidative  stress11 (see
Chapter 6).

ANTIOXIDANT THEORY

The body has developed defense mecha-
nisms,  known  as  antioxidants,  which
protect  against  the  ravages  of  free  radi-
cals  by  reducing  and  neutralizing  them.
Antioxidative  enzymes  that  naturally-
occur  in  the  skin  include  superoxide
dismutase,  catalase,  and  glutathione
peroxidase (GPX);  the  nonenzymatic
endogenous antioxidative molecules are
alpha-tocopherol  (vitamin  E),  ascorbic
acid 
(vitamin  C),  glutathione,  and
ubiquinone.12 As  part  of  the  natural
aging  process,  our  defense  mechanisms
diminsh,  while  the  production  of  ROS
increases. This leads to an imbalance and
an  elevated  number  of  unchecked  free
radicals  that  damage  DNA,  cytoskeletal
elements,  cellular  proteins,  and  cellular
membranes.  Moreover,  many  of  the
body’s antioxidant defense mechanisms
are inhibited by UV and visible light.13,14
Additionally,  UV 
is
known to cause an increase in free radi-
cal  formation.15 Researchers  are  cur-
rently  studying  the  potential  of  using
exogenous  antioxidants  to  affect  this
process and mitigate the damage caused
by free radicals. Many believe that topi-
cal application and oral consumption of
combinations of antioxidants may result
in a sustained antioxidant capacity of the
skin because of synergistic actions of the
combined  antioxidants.  Antioxidants
may  be  particularly  useful  in  UVA-
induced skin alterations that are believed
to be determined, in large part, by oxida-
tive processes. In fact, topical application
of antioxidants has been shown to raise

light  exposure 

the  minimal  UVA  dose  necessary  to
induce  immediate  pigment  darkening
and  diminish  the  severity  of  UVA-
induced  photodermatoses.15 Although
antioxidants  appear  in  vegetables  and
other  foods  in  addition  to  the  human
body,  many  believe  that  higher  levels
can  be  achieved  by  supplementation.
Consequently, the use of products tout-
ing antioxidants as protective ingredients
in oral supplements and topically applied
agents has become extremely popular.

Topical  antioxidants  are  currently
marketed for the prevention of aging and
UV-mediated skin damage as well as the
treatment  of  wrinkles  and  erythema
caused  by  inflammation,  such  as  that
induced  by  laser  resurfacing.  The  free
radical  theory  of  aging  explains  why
antioxidants  are  thought  to  prevent
wrinkles, but this theory does not justify
the use of antioxidants to treat wrinkles
that  are  already  present.  Many  compa-
nies claim that their antioxidant-contain-
ing  products  “treat”  wrinkles;  however,
this is often an exaggeration.  At this time,
vitamin C is the ONLY antioxidant that can
treat wrinkles, but this capacity is because of
its  effects  in  promoting  collagen  formation,
which  is  unrelated  to  its  antioxidant  effects.
When products such as the combination
formulation  studied  by  Cho  et  al.  are
associated  with  amelioration  of  wrin-
kles, such a result can be ascribed either
to  a  swelling  or  hydrating  effect  of  the
product, or the vitamin C or retinol con-
tained in the product.16 It is important to
stress  to  patients  that  antioxidants  pre-
vent wrinkles  but  do  not  treat wrinkles
(with the exception of vitamin C).

In addition to their namesake antioxi-
dant  effects,  all  antioxidants  exhibit
anti-inflammatory properties, which are
described in detail in Chapter 35. Some of
the antioxidants depicted below also pos-
sess  depigmenting  activities,  which  are
described in more detail in Chapter 33.

Although  the  theory  of  antioxidants
is a sound one, there are several impor-
tant factors to consider when evaluating
the  efficacy  of  antioxidants.  In  order 
to  be  considered  biologically  active,
orally  administered  products  must  be
absorbed  and  shown  to  raise  antioxi-
dant levels in the skin. Topically admin-
istered  products  must  be  absorbed  into
the skin and delivered to the target tis-
sue in the active form and remain there
long enough to exert the desired effects.
Some  antioxidants  are  very  unstable;
therefore, some ingredients such as vita-
min  C  become  oxidized  and  rendered

Vitamin E

Found  in  vegetables,  oils,  seeds,  nuts,
corn, soy, whole wheat flour, margarine,
and  in  some  meat  and  dairy  products,
vitamin  E,  or  tocopherol,  is  actually  a
universal term for a group of compounds
comprising  of  tocol  and  tocotrienol
derivatives,  specifically  four  pairs  of
racemic stereoisomers (Fig. 34-1). Of the
four tocopherols (alpha-, beta-, gamma-,
and  delta-),  alpha-tocopherol 
(also
known  as  AT)  has  the  highest  activity.
Since the discovery that vitamin E is the
primary lipid-soluble antioxidant in skin
that protects cells from oxidative stress,18
practitioners have used it to treat a wide
variety of skin lesions. The general pub-
lic  has  frequently  looked  to  it  for  treat-
ment of minor burns, surgical scars, and
other  wounds,  even  though  its  use  for
dermatoses  has  not  been  approved  by
the FDA. In addition, vitamin E is touted
as beneficial in protecting against cardio-
vascular  disease  because  lipid  peroxida-
tion is a major contributor to atheroscle-
rosis 
cardiovascular  disease.
Administration  of  vitamin  E  is  thought
to decrease the extent of lipid peroxida-
tion  and  protect  against  cardiovascular
disease.19 In the same way that vitamin E
protects the cells from lipid peroxidation
in the arteries, it protects the cell mem-
branes in the skin from peroxidation.

and 

Authors  have  shown  a  correlation
between dietary deficiency of vitamin E
and  an  increase  in  oxidative  stress  and
cell  injury.18 In  1993,  Tanaka  et  al.
reported that ROS induce changes in the
biosynthesis  of  collagen  and  gly-
cosaminoglycans  (GAGs)  in  cultured
human  dermal  fibroblasts.20 This  alter-
ation  was  prevented  with  the  addition
of alpha-tocopherol to the fibroblasts. In
addition,  vitamin  E  has  been  shown  to
lower  prostaglandin  E2 production,21
and  augment  interleukin-2  (IL-2)  pro-
duction,  leading  to  anti-inflammatory
and  immunostimulatory  activity.  It  is
believed  that  this  stabilization  effect
may play a role in collagen biosynthesis.22
Thus  far,  in  vivo  attempts  to  measure
and link changes in collagen production
with altered concentrations of vitamin E
have proved inconclusive.

A  lower  incidence  of  infectious  dis-
ease  and  cancer  has  been  observed  in

inactive  before  reaching  the  target.
Stabilizing  ingredients  in  formulation
and  packaging  them  in  order  to  mini-
mize air and light exposure are challeng-
ing  tasks.  Absorption  is  also  important
and  depends  on  several  factors  such  as
the molecular form of the compound, its
pH,  whether  it  is  water  soluble  or  fat
soluble, and the vehicle that contains the
product. This chapter will include a dis-
cussion  of  the  most  popular  types  of
antioxidants found in cosmetic products
or taken orally by cosmetic patients.

ANTIOXIDANT SYNERGY

Although  there  are  hundreds  of  natu-
rally-occurring  antioxidants,  most  of
those  currently  used  in  the  cosmetic
industry are believed to work synergisti-
cally  to  regenerate  and  “enhance  the
power” of each other. The antioxidants
that  have  been  identified  as  working
cooperatively  have  been  referred  to  as
network  antioxidants.17 For  example,
after an antioxidant “disarms” a free rad-
ical  by  eliminating  the  odd  number  of
electrons (by either adding or removing
an electron), it is unable to function fur-
ther  as  an  antioxidant  unless  it  is  recy-
cled.  The  five  antioxidants  that  have
been  labeled  as  network  antioxidants
are vitamins C and E, glutathione, lipoic
acid,  and  Coenzyme  Q10  (CoQ10).
Vitamin C or CoQ10 can recycle vitamin
E,  donating  electrons  to  vitamin  E  to
return  the  nutrient  to  its  antioxidant
state. Vitamin C and glutathione can be
recycled  by  lipoic  acid  or  vitamin  C.
These  network  antioxidants  are  being
included in an increasing number of cos-
metic preparations. It is likely that many
antioxidants  work  synergistically,  and
that  the  term  “network  antioxidant”
applies to many more antioxidants than
the five identified as the “network.”

FAT-SOLUBLE ANTIOXIDANTS

These are found in the lipophilic portion
of  the  cell  membrane  and  include  vita-
min E, carotenoids, and CoQ10. Further,
idebenone,  the  synthetic  analog  of
CoQ10,  and  food-derived  lycopene  are
also fat-soluble antioxidants.

studies  on  elderly  subjects  that  exhibit
high  plasma  tocopherol  levels.23–25 For
this  reason,  vitamin  E  is  considered  by
many  to  be  a  necessary  and  powerful
antioxidant.  In  addition,  vitamin  E
seems  to  offer  photoprotection  when
taken  orally  and  applied  topically.
Numerous reports indicate that the topi-
cal  application  of  alpha-tocopherol  to
animal  skin  is  effective  in  lowering  the
production  of  sunburn  cells,26,27 reduc-
ing the damage caused by chronic UVB
exposure,28,29 and  inhibiting  photocar-
cinogenesis.30 Specifically,  researchers
have found that oral and topical vitamin
E  supplementation  in  certain  animals
diminishes  the  effects  of  photoaging,
inhibits the development of skin cancer,
and  counteracts  immunosuppression
induced  by  UV  radiation.30–33 In  1992,
Trevithick et al. noted that topical d-(cid:7)-
tocopherol acetate diminished erythema
because  of  sunburn,  edema,  and  skin
sensitivity  in  mice  when  application
occurred  following  exposure  to  UVB
radiation.34 In  a  study  in  which  toco-
pherol 5% was applied to mice prior to
UVB exposure, Bissett et al. observed a
75% decrease in skin wrinkling, a rise in
tumor latency, and a reduction of cuta-
neous tumors; however, vitamin E failed
to affect UVA-induced skin sagging.35 In
a  different  study  in  which  subjects
applied  tocopherol  (5%–8%)  cream
facially  for  4  weeks,  Mayer  observed
diminished  skin  roughness,  shorter
length of facial lines, and reduced wrin-
kle depth as compared to placebo.36

Oral and topical administration of vit-
amin  E  have  been  demonstrated  to
inhibit UV-induced erythema and edema
in  animals.37 In  humans,  it  has  been
shown  that  UV-induced  expression  of
human  macrophage  metalloelastase,  a
member of the MMP family involved in
degradation of elastin, could be inhibited
by pretreatment with vitamin E (5%). In
this study, vitamine E was applied to the
skin under light-tight occlusion 24 hours
before UV treatment.38

A  double-blind,  placebo-controlled
study examined the protective effects of
orally administered vitamin E [400 inter-
national  units  (IU)  per  day]  against  UV-
induced  epidermal  damage  in  humans.
The  subjects  were  followed  for  a 
6-month period. Minimal erythema dose
(MED)  and  histologic  response  were
determined  at  baseline,  1  month,  and  6
months. In this study, there was no sig-
nificant  difference  between  the  placebo
group and those treated with vitamin E
and  the  investigators  concluded  that
daily  ingestion  of  400  IU  of  oral  alpha-
tocopherol  daily  did  not  provide  any

meaningful  photoprotection.39 Other
authors have suggested that if vitamin E
provides  any  photoprotection  at  all,  it
may  require  interaction  with  other
antioxidants,  such  as  vitamin  C,  to  do
so.40 This  notion  was  supported  by  the
study  of  Lin  et  al.  who  showed  in
Yorkshire pigs that the combined appli-
cation of 1% (cid:7)-tocopherol with 15% L-
ascorbic  acid  provided  superior  protec-
tion  against  erythema  and  sunburn  cell
formation compared to either 1% alpha-
tocopherol  or  15%  L-ascorbic  acid
alone.41

WOUND HEALING Oxygen radicals form in
response  to  injury  and  further  inhibit
recovery  by  attacking  DNA,  cellular
membranes,  proteins,  and  lipids.  It  is
believed that antioxidants act to amelio-
rate  wounds  by  reducing  the  damage
induced  by  free  oxygen  radicals,  which
are released by neutrophils in the inflam-
matory phase of the healing process.42 In
the  late  1960s,  Kamimura  et  al.  per-
formed  quantitative  research  demon-
strating that topically applied vitamin E
penetrates into the deep dermis and sub-
cutaneous tissue.43 Numerous scientists,
as well as many laypersons, have inter-
preted this to mean that topically applied
vitamin E may improve wound healing.
Contradictory  results  have  emerged
from animal studies undertaken to evalu-
ate  the  effects  of  vitamin  E  on  wound
healing, however. This may be explained
by  the  fact  that  unlike  other  vitamins,
tocopherols  exhibit  species-specific
mechanisms of action.44

In  a  prospective,  double-blind,  ran-
domized study on humans, Jenkins et al.
tried  to  diminish  scarring  in  burn
patients following reconstructive surgery
by  applying  topical  vitamin  E.  The
researchers  observed  no  difference
between  the  control  and  treatment
groups, however, and nearly 20% of the
patients  reported  local  reactions  to  the
vitamin  E  cream.45 In  another  study,46
the  primary  author  and  a  collaborator
assessed  the  cosmetic  benefit  resulting
from the use of topically applied vitamin
E to surgical scars. In a double-blind fash-
ion,  patients  applied  320  IU  of  d-(cid:7)
tocopheryl/gram  of  Aquaphor  to  one
side  of  the  scar  and  Aquaphor  alone  to
the  other  side  of  the  scar.  The  patients
were followed for 6 months. At the con-
clusion of the study, the vitamin E prepa-
ration  failed  to  improve  the  cosmetic
appearance  of  surgical  scars,  and  even
made the scars worse in a few subjects.

FORMS OF VITAMIN E Vitamin E is a family
of compounds called tocopherols, includ-

ing,  as  mentioned  above,  alpha-,  beta-,
gamma-,  and  delta-tocopherol.  Alpha-
tocopherol  is  the  most  active  form  and
the  form  on  which  the  recommended
daily  allowance  (RDA)  is  based.  The
names  of  all  types  of  vitamin  E  begin
with either “d” or “dl,” designations that
refer  to  differences  in  chemical  struc-
ture.  The  “d”  form  is  the  natural  form
and “dl” is the synthetic form. The nat-
ural  form  is  more  active  and  better
absorbed.  Synthetic  vitamin  E  supple-
ments  contain  only  alpha-tocopherol,
while  food  sources  contain  several  dif-
ferent  tocopherols,  including  alpha-,
delta-, and gamma-tocopherol.

Vitamin  E  forms  are  listed  as  either
“tocopherol”  or  the  esterified  “toco-
pheryl”  followed  by  the  name  of  the
substance  to  which  it  is  attached,  as  in
“tocopheryl acetate.” The two forms are
very similar but tocopherol displays bet-
ter  absorption,  while  tocopheryl  forms
exhibit slightly better shelf life. In health
food  stores,  the  most  common  oral
forms  of  vitamin  E  are  d-(cid:7) tocopherol,
d-(cid:7) tocopheryl acetate, and alpha-toco-
pheryl  succinate.  The  vitamin  E  forms
typically  used  in  cosmetics  are  alpha-
tocopheryl acetate and alpha-tocopheryl
linoleate.  These  compounds  are  less
likely to elicit contact dermatitis than d-(cid:7)
tocopheryl and are more stable at room
temperature.  However,  the  tocopherol
esters are also more poorly absorbed by
the  skin  than  the  tocopherol  forms,47
and  may  not  exert  the  same  photopro-
tective effects. One study demonstrated
that  alpha-tocopheryl  acetate  or  alpha-
tocopheryl  succinate  not  only  failed  to
prevent  photocarcinogenesis,  but  also
may  have  enhanced  it.48 Because  the
alpha-tocopherol  esters  are  included  in
many  skin  lotions,  cosmetics,  and  sun-
screens,  further  studies  are  needed  to
determine  if  the  tocopherol  esters
indeed promote or contribute to photo-
carcinogenesis.

SIDE  EFFECTS The  primary  author’s
study46 as  well  as  the  one  by  Jenkins45
suggest that the incidence of contact der-
matitis  because  of  topical  vitamin  E
application may be relatively high for cer-
tain  forms  of  tocopherol.45 Tocopherol
acetate  seems  to  be  the  worst  culprit,49
but allergy to dl-(cid:7)-tocopheryl nicotinate
has also been reported.50 In 1992, Swiss
researchers  evaluated  1000  cases  of  an
atypical  papular  and  follicular  contact
dermatitis  provoked  by  vitamin  E
linoleate that was an additive to cosmet-
ics. The conclusion was that oxidized vit-
amin E derivatives can operate synergisti-
cally  in  vivo  as  haptens  or  as  irritants.51

The topical application of vitamin E has
also  been  linked  with  contact  urticaria,
eczematous  dermatitis,  and  erythema
multiforme-like reactions.52

The  recommended  dose  of  oral  vita-
min E is 22 IU per day; however, many
physicians recommend 400 IU twice per
day.  In  1988,  a  thorough  literature
review  by  Bendich  and  Machlin  found
extended  use  of  oral  vitamin  E  up  to
3000  mg/d  to  be  safe.53 A  subsequent
study  by  Kappus  and  Diplock  estab-
lished as absolutely safe vitamin E doses
up to 400 mg/d, doses between 400 mg
and  2000  mg  as  unlikely  to  cause
adverse  reactions,  and  doses  greater
than 3000 mg/d over an extended period
as  a  potential  source  of  side  effects.54
Because  vitamin  E  can  contribute  to  a
blood-thinning  effect,  patients  on  anti-
coagulant  therapy  are  advised  to  avoid
high  doses  of  vitamin  E  ((cid:10)4000  IU).55
Although there is likely no clinically sig-
nificant reduction in platelet aggregation
in those with normal platelets, patients
are  frequently  advised  to  suspend  vita-
min E supplementation prior to surgery.
This is essential for patients with abnor-
mal  platelets,  vitamin  K  deficiency,  or
those taking antiplatelet agents.56

SUMMARY Vitamin  E  has  been  used  to
treat or protect against various dermato-
logic  conditions  including  skin  cancer,
dystrophic  epidermolysis  bullosa,  dis-
coid  lupus  erythematosus,  yellow  nail
syndrome,  granuloma  annulare,  atopic
dermatitis,  pemphigus,  and  lichen  scle-
rosus  et  atrophicus,  among  others.37
Results have varied just as widely as the
range  of  diseases  treated.  In  fact,  some
authors  have  reported  that  the  use  of
oral  vitamin  E  will  reduce  the  side
effects  of  retinoids57;  however,  other
studies have not shown this benefit.58

The  most  promising  reason  for
research  into  the  dermatologic  use  of
vitamin  E  appears  to  be  its  antioxidant
activity. The potency of vitamin E as an
antioxidant  can  be  increased  through
combination  with  other  antioxidants.
Vitamin  E  also  appears  to  offer  a  ripe
area  for  research  into  its  potential  for
therapeutic  benefit  in  the  prevention
and  treatment  of  skin  cancer  and  pho-
toaging. In addition, vitamin E displays
emollient properties, and is stable, easy
to formulate, and relatively inexpensive,
rendering it a popular additive to antiag-
ing preparations.

Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone)

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a naturally-
occurring  nutrient  available  through

 
 
 
food consumption. Fish and shellfish are
good  dietary  sources  of  CoQ10.  The
current recommended oral dose is 90 to
150 mg daily; however, many physicians
are  recommending  200  to  400  mg/d.
CoQ10 is a fat-soluble compound found
in all cells as part of the electron transfer
chain responsible for energy production.
It  is  estimated  that  CoQ10  provides
95% of the body’s energy (ATP) require-
ments.59 CoQ10 has also been found to
have  antioxidant  properties.  The  “Q”
alludes  to 
in  the
quinone  family;  the  “10”  identifies  the
number  of  isoprenoid  units  on  its  side
chain  (Fig.  34-2).  The  biosynthesis  of
CoQ10  is  a  complex  process  that
depends on a copious supply of essential
amino  acids,  such  as  tyrosine,  and  sev-
eral vitamins and trace elements. There
are several studies on the use of CoQ10
in the cardiology literature.60

its  membership 

fibroblasts 

Researchers  have  identified  an  age-
related  decline  of  CoQ10  levels  in  ani-
mals  and  humans.61 For  this  reason,
many believe that the antioxidant activi-
ties  of  CoQ10  may  make  it  useful  as  a
treatment  for  aged  skin.  A  study  by
Hoppe  et  al.  demonstrated  that  CoQ10
penetrated  into  the  viable  layers  of  the
skin  and  significantly  suppressed  the
expression  of  collagenase  in  human 
dermal 
following  UVA 
irradiation.62 It  was  further  shown  that
prolonged supplementation of CoQ10 in
humans reduces wrinkle formation in the
corner  of  the  eye.  In  another  study,  the
same group orally supplemented CoQ10
(0, 1, 100 mg/kg po) daily for 2 weeks and
noted that levels of CoQ10 significantly
increased in the epidermis, but not in the
dermis.  They  hypothesized  that  this
might be a prerequisite to the reduction
of wrinkles and other benefits related to
the  potent  antioxidant  and  energizing
effects of CoQ10 in skin.63

Patients  taking  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-
glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reduc-
tase  inhibitors  (statins)  to  lower  their
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol have
been  shown  to  have  decreased  mito-
chondrial CoQ10 levels. This is because
statin  drugs  inhibit  the  conversion  of
HMG-CoA  to  mevalonate,  a  precursor
for  cholesterol  and  CoQ10.  In  cell

culture, decreased mitochondrial CoQ10
levels  have  been  associated  with  a
higher  degree  of  cell  death,  increased
DNA oxidative damage, and a reduction
in ATP synthesis. Oral supplementation
of CoQ10 has been shown to reduce cell
death  and  DNA  oxidative  stress,  and
increase  ATP  synthesis.64 For  this  rea-
son,  many  physicians  recommend  that
patients  taking  statins  should  supple-
ment CoQ10 orally. The most commonly
prescribed dose is 200 to 400 mg/d, in the
morning.  Coenzyme  Q10  exhibits
caffeine-like  effects  and  can  lead  to
insomnia if taken at night.

COENZYME  Q10  LEVELS  AND  SKIN  CANCER
levels  of
Abnormally 
CoQ10  have  been  found  in  patients
with  cancer  of  the  breast,  lung,  or 
pancreas.65 A  recent  study  investigated
the  usefulness  of  CoQ10  plasma  levels
in  predicting  the  risk  of  metastasis  and
the duration of the metastasis-free inter-
val in melanoma patients. Rusciani et al.
showed that CoQ10 levels were signifi-
cantly lower in melanoma patients than
in  control  subjects  and  in  patients  who
developed metastases than in the metas-
tasis-free subgroup. They suggested that
baseline  plasma  CoQ10  levels  could
serve as a prognostic factor to estimate
the risk for melanoma progression.66

In the adjuvant therapy of melanoma
with interferon (IFN), it seems that large
amounts  of  ATP  are  required  for  an
immune response initiated by IFN to be
effective. It has thus been hypothesized
that  the  failure  of  some  patients  to
respond  to  IFN  therapy  may  be  caused
by  an  inability  to  meet  the  excess
demand  for  ATP  induced  by  this  med-
ication.  However,  it  is  known  that
CoQ10  plays  a  key  role  in  the  mito-
chondrial  respiratory  cycle  and  produc-
tion of ATP.67,68 Therefore, Rusciani et al.
conducted a clinical trial in stage I and II
melanoma patients examining a postsur-
gical  adjuvant  therapy  with  recombi-
nant IFN alpha-2b in combination with
coenzyme  Q10  versus  IFN  alpha-2b
alone for the control group. In a 3-year
trial,  they  uninterruptedly  treated  the
patients with low-dose recombinant IFN
alpha-2b  administered  twice  daily  and
coenzyme Q10 (400 mg/d). The control
group  was  treated  with  only  low-dose
recombinant  IFN  alpha-2b  in  the  same
dosage  and  administration.  Treatment
efficacy  was  evaluated  as  incidence  of
recurrences  at  5  years.  The  group
demonstrated that the risk of developing
metastases was about 10 times lower in
the  IFN  (cid:4) CoQ10  patients  compared
with the IFN-alone group.69 However, a

10-year follow-up will be needed to pro-
vide more significant results. 

the 

At the time of publication of this text
there  were  several  over-the-counter
(OTC)  cosmetic  products,  including
Nivea  and  Eucerin,  on  the  market  con-
taining CoQ10. Although they are very
popular,  more  research  is  needed  to
long-term  preventive
examine 
effects of these products in order to see
if they are truly able to prevent the cuta-
neous signs of aging. CoQ10 is stable in
topical  products.  Penetration  depends
on the characteristics of the topical for-
mulation because of the high-molecular-
weight  of  this  compound.  Formulation
with  this  ingredient  leads  to  a  yellow
tint in the product.

SIDE EFFECTS Oral CoQ10 supplementa-
tion has been associated with a caffeine-
like side effect and may cause nervous-
ness  or  a  jittery  feeling.  So  as  not  to
induce  insomnia,  it  is  recommended
that  CoQ10  not  be  taken  at  night.
Diarrhea, appetite loss, and mild nausea
are  among  the  other  side  effects
reported.70 No  side  effects  have  been
reported  with 
topical  application.
CoQ10  has  not  been  reported  to  cause
contact dermatitis.

Idebenone 

Idebenone  is  the  synthetic  analog  of
CoQ10,  penetrating  the  skin  more
efficiently because of its lower molecu-
lar  weight.  Idebenone  has  been  shown
to  possess  superior  antioxidant  capacity
compared to CoQ10, tocopherol, kinetin,
ascorbic acid, and lipoic acid in various
in vitro and in vivo trials.71

TOPICAL  APPLICATION McDaniel  et  al.
examined  the 
in  vivo  efficacy  of
idebenone in a topical skincare formula-
tion for the treatment of photodamaged
skin.  In  a  randomized,  blind  labeled,
nonvehicle  control  study,  41  female
subjects  used  either  0.5%  or  1.0%
idebenone  formulations  twice  daily  for
6  weeks.72 After  6  weeks  both  user
groups  showed  improvement  of  all
examined parameters. A 26% reduction
in  skin  roughness/dryness  was  mea-
sured  in  the  1.0%  user  group  as  was  a
29%  reduction  in  fine  lines/wrinkles;
this  group  also  experienced  a  33%
improvement  in  overall  global  assess-
ment  of  photodamaged  skin.  For  users
of  the  0.5%  idebenone  formulation,
reductions in skin roughness/dryness as
well  as  fine  lines/wrinkles  were  23%
and  27%,  respectively,  and  improve-
ment  in  overall  global  assessment  of

photodamaged  skin  was  30%.  It  is
important to remember that the effects
seen  on  wrinkles  in  these  trials  were
likely caused by hydration or skin irrita-
tion  because  antioxidants  have  exhib-
ited  no  efficacy  in  treating  wrinkles
(with  the  exception  of  vitamin  C),  but
can  help  prevent  them.  Skin  care  prod-
ucts containing idebenone are commer-
cially  available  as  Prevage  MD  by
Allergan  (1%  idebenone),  and  Prevage
and Prevage Eye Antiaging Moisturizing
Treatment  by  Elizabeth  Arden  and
Allergan (0.5% idebenone).

SIDE  EFFECTS A  recent  case  report  of
contact  dermatitis  owing  to  a  facial
treatment with an “antiaging” cream in a
beauty  salon  identified  the  allergen  as
idebenone  0.5%  by  patch  testing.73 As
idebenone  has  become  more  popular,
contact  allergy  to  this  compound  has
become more common.73

Lycopene 

Lycopene  is  a  natural  pigment  synthe-
sized by plants and microorganisms. It is
an  open-chain,  unsaturated  carotenoid
that is found in red fruits and vegetables
such as tomatoes, pink grapefruit, water-
melon,  and  apricots.  In  fact,  it  is
lycopene that is responsible for the red
pigment we observe in those fruits and
vegetables.74,75 It  has  been  documented
that  dietary  intake  of  tomatoes  and
tomato  products  containing  lycopene  is
associated with decreased risk of chronic
disorders such as cancer and cardiovas-
cular diseases.76–78

Lycopene  has  been  found  to  exhibit
potent antioxidant properties. Because of
its  high  number  of  conjugated  double
bonds,  it  demonstrates  stronger  singlet
oxygen-quenching  ability  compared  to
alpha-tocopherol  or  beta-carotene.76
Clinical trials with tomato products sug-
gest a synergistic action of lycopene with
other  nutrients  in  lowering  biomarkers
of oxidative stress and carcinogenesis.79
Further, lycopene has been shown to
prevent carcinogenesis in various tumor
models.80–83 Reported  mechanisms  of
action are arrest of tumor cell-cycle pro-
gression,  insulin-like  growth  factor-1
(IGF-1)  signaling  transduction,  and
induction  of  apoptosis.  A  recent  study
suggested  that  part  of  the  antitumor
activity of lycopene might be caused by
the  trapping  activity  of  lycopene  on
platelet-derived  growth  factor  (PDGF),
suggesting  that  this  antioxidant  acts  as
an inhibitor on tumor stromal cells.84

In  skin  cancer,  mouse  models  have
demonstrated its chemopreventive effects

against  photo-induced  tumors.85,86 Lyco-
pene appears to have the potential to pre-
vent  skin  cancer  and  warrants  further
investigation for such an indication.

Although  the  clinical  data  in  humans
are very limited, lycopene is included in
various  skin  care  products,  including
facial  moisturizers,  sunscreens,  eye
creams, and formulations touted for their
“antiaging”  skin  care.  Further  data  in
humans are needed to shed more light on
the effects of lycopene on human skin.

Curcumin 

Curcumin is a yellow pigment found in
the  root  of  the  tropical  turmeric  plant,
Curcuma  longa, which  belongs  to  the
Zingiberaceae family. Turmeric consists
of a water-soluble component, turmerin,
and  a  lipid-soluble  component,  cur-
cumin.87 Curcumin  has  been  used  for
centuries in traditional medicine for var-
ious  treatments  such  as  inflammatory
conditions and other diseases; in Indian
cuisine  it  is  used  as  a  spice.  Turmeric
tubers  contain  curcuminoids,  of  which
curcumin I (diferuloyl methane) is most
abundant, followed by curcumin II (6%)
and  III  (0.3%)88 (Fig.  34-3).  Curcumin
has been shown to exhibit a broad array
of biologic activities, such as anti-inflam-
matory,  anticarcinogenic,  antioxidant,
antimicrobial,  and  wound  healing.89–91
The molecular basis of these effects are
mediated through the regulation of vari-
ous transcription factors, growth factors,
inflammatory cytokines, protein kinases,
adhesion  molecules,  apoptotic  genes,
angiogenesis  regulators,  and  other
enzymes.92,93

ANTIOXIDANT  AND  ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
ACTIVITIES  OF  CURCUMIN Curcumin  has
been identified as a potent scavenger of
a  variety  of  ROS,  including  superoxide
anion  radicals,  hydroxyl  radicals,  and
nitrogen  dioxide  radicals.94 Also,  cur-
cumin has been shown to downregulate
the  production  of  the  proinflammatory
cytokines  IL-1  and  tumor  necrosis 
factor-(cid:7) (TNF-(cid:7)), and to inhibit the acti-
vation  of  transcription  factors  NF-(cid:8)B
and AP-1, both regulating the genes for
proinflammatory mediators and protec-
tive antioxidant genes.95

The  antioxidant  and  anti-inflamma-
tory  properties  of  curcumin  have  been
documented  in  mouse  models,  proving
that  curcumin  has  a  beneficial  effect
against  chemo-  and  photocarcinogene-
sis. Further studies are needed in order to
determine  whether  topical  applications
or  oral  intake  of  curcumin  can  inhibit
skin carcinogenesis in humans.96–98 Oral
intake  of  curcumin  in  humans  was
recently  evaluated  and  established  as
nontoxic at doses up to 8 g/d when taken
by  mouth  for  3  months.99 These  are
promising developments; further studies
are  needed  to  elucidate  the  role  of  this
antioxidant  compound  as  a  pho-
tochemopreventive agent.

WOUND-HEALING  EFFECTS  OF  CURCUMIN
Sidhu  et  al.  demonstrated  that  wound
closure  in  curcumin-treated  normal  and
genetically  diabetic  animals  was  signifi-
cantly faster compared to controls. This
enhanced  healing  effect  was  attributed
to  the  improvement  of  neovasculariza-
tion and reepithelialization, the increase
of  expression  and  production  of  trans-
forming growth factor-1 and fibronectin,
and  the  reduction  of  cell  death  by 
curcumin.100 Curcumin  treatment  has
also  improved  collagen  deposition  and
increased fibroblast and vascular density,
enhancing  both  normal  and  impaired
wound healing. The observed proangio-
genic effect of curcumin in wound heal-
ing  is  believed  to  be  based  on  inducing
transforming  growth  factor-beta,  which
in  turn  induces  angiogenesis  and  the
accumulation of extracellular matrix.101

CURCUMIN  AND  SKIN  CANCER Curcumin
has  been  demonstrated  to 
inhibit
carcinogenesis  in  several  tumor  model
systems  including  skin  neoplastic  mod-
els.95,96,102–104 Its mechanism of action is
not precisely known, but it is thought to
inhibit  initiation,  promotion,  and  pro-
gression  of  cancer.105 Curcumin  was
reported to inhibit UVA-induced metal-
lothionein  expression  and  ornithine
decarboxylase  (ODC)  activity,  and  to
induce p53-mediated apoptosis, as well
as  cell  membrane-mediated  apoptosis
through  Fas  receptor  induction  and
caspase-8 activation.96,106,107

Paradoxically,  some  recent  studies
have suggested that the anticancer activ-
ity of the antioxidant curcumin has actu-
ally promoted the generation of ROS.108
In response, Chen et al. investigated the
antioxidant  and  anticancer  activity  of
curcumin  in  human  myeloid  leukemia
(HL-60) cells. They determined that the
anticancer  activity  of  curcumin  was
effective  in  a  concentration-  and  time-
dependent manner in reducing the pro-
liferation and viability of leukemia cells,
but its effect on ROS was concentration
dependent.  That  is,  low  concentrations
of curcumin decreased ROS generation,
but  high  concentrations  had  the  oppo-
site  effect.  In  additional  studies,  Chen 
et  al.  found  that  the  combination  of
water-soluble antioxidants amplified the
antioxidant  and  anticancer  activity  of
low curcumin concentrations.108

Currently,  there  are  only  a  few  cos-
metic  products  containing  curcumin
because  its  distinct  and  pungent  aroma
and color make it difficult to formulate
into  a  cosmetically  elegant  product.
More clinical trials are needed to evalu-
ate  the  effects  of  curcumin  on  human
skin.

WATER-SOLUBLE
ANTIOXIDANTS

These are found in hydrophobic areas of
the cell and the serum and include vita-
min C and glutathione.

Glutathione

Glutathione 
is  the  most  abundant
antioxidant  in  the  network.  It  is  pro-
duced  from  the  amino  acids  glutamic
acid,  cysteine,  and  glycine.  Oral  glu-
tathione  is  not  well  absorbed  into  the
body, so supplementation is difficult—it
is  not  even  available  in  cosmetic  prod-
ucts. There are no studies evaluating the
efficacy of glutathione as an antioxidant.
Significantly,  though,  lipoic  acid  can
recycle glutathione.

Vitamin C

Vitamin  C  is  historically  known  for  its
role in the prevention of scurvy. By the
18th  century,  sailors  knew  that  eating
citrus  fruits  prevented  this  condition
associated  with  dental  abnormalities,
bleeding  disorders,  characteristic  pur-
puric skin lesions, and mental deteriora-
tion. In the 1930s, researchers confirmed
that  vitamin  C  is  the  key  ingredient  in
citrus  fruit  that  prevents  scurvy.109 In
contrast  to  some  animals,  humans
obtain vitamin C solely from food, such

as  citrus  fruits,  black  currants,  red  pep-
pers, and leafy green vegetables. Unfor-
tunately  oral  supplementation  of  vita-
min  C  does  not  increase  the  levels  of
vitamin  C  in  the  skin,  as  the  transport
from the gastrointestinal tract is limited.
Moreover,  sunlight  and  environmental
pollution,  such  as  ozone  in  city  pollu-
tion,  can  deplete  epidermal  vitamin
C.110,111 Thus,  enhancing  the  levels  of
vitamin  C  in  the  skin  is  an  important
goal,  as  vitamin  C  is  known  to  be  a
potent antioxidant.

Today,  vitamin  C,  also  known  as
ascorbic  acid,  is  being  studied  exten-
sively for its role as an antioxidant. Oral
vitamin  C  has  been  associated  with
decreasing  the  risk  of  certain  cancers,
cardiovascular disease, and cataracts, as
well  as  improving  wound  healing  and
immune  modulation.112,113 Vitamin  C
has also been used as a topical antioxi-
dant  to  prevent  sun  damage,26 and  for
the  treatment  of  melasma,114 striae
alba,115 and  postoperative  erythema  in
laser patients.116

CHEMISTRY  OF  VITAMIN  C Vitamin  C,  or
ascorbate,  is  an  alpha-ketolactone  that
exists  as  a  hydrophilic  monovalent
hydroxyl anion. Adding one electron to
ascorbate creates the ascorbate free rad-
ical.  This  transient  form  is  more  stable
than  other  free  radicals  and  can  accept
other  electrons,  making  it  an  effective
free  radical  scavenger,  and  thus  a  great
antioxidant. If the transient form cannot
take an electron, it will yield the electron
to  an  enzymatic  reaction,  thereby
becoming an electron donor.

When  two  electrons  are  added  to
ascorbic acid (AA), the reaction forms a
new  substance  called  dehydro-L-ascor-
bic  acid  (DHAA).  Under  physiologic
conditions,  vitamin  C  predominantly
exists in its reduced form, ascorbic acid;
it  also  exists  in  trace  quantities  in  the
oxidized  form,  DHAA  (Fig.  34-4).  This
substance  can  be  reduced  back  to
ascorbate,  but  if  the  lactone  ring  irre-
versibly  opens,  forming  diketogulonic
acid, the compound is no longer active.
Diketogulonic  acid  is  often  formed
when  vitamin  C  preparations  are  oxi-
dized. When this occurs, these solutions
are  rendered 
ineffective  and  use-
less.112,113 In other words, when vitamin

C preparations are exposed to UV rays
or to air, the molecule rapidly adds two
electrons and converts to DHAA, which
contains an aromatic ring. If further oxi-
dized,  the  ring  irreversibly  opens  and
the vitamin C solution becomes perma-
nently inactive.

VITAMIN C AS AN ANTIOXIDANT Vitamin C
has become a popular addition to “after-
sun”  products  because  it  has  been
shown to interfere with the UV-induced
generation of ROS by reacting with the
superoxide  anion117 or  the  hydroxyl 
radical.118 In fact, vitamin C is known to
delay the incidence of UV-induced neo-
plasms  in  mice.119 Topical  vitamin  C
was  studied  as  a  photoprotectant  first
using  a  porcine  skin  model.26 In  this
study,  histologic  examination  revealed
that animals treated with topical ascor-
bic  acid  exhibited  fewer  sunburn  cells
than  those  treated  with  vehicle  alone
when  exposed  to  both  UVA  and  UVB
irradiation. (Sunburn cells are basal ker-
atinocytes undergoing programmed cell
death because of irreparable DNA dam-
age and represent a method of quantify-
ing  the  damaging  effects  of  UV  irra-
diation.)  Researchers  also  observed  a
significant decrease in erythema in areas
treated with vitamin C and decreases in
the amount of vitamin C left on the skin
after  UV  irradiation.  In  a  subsequent
study,  Darr  and  colleagues  discovered
that  topical  vitamin  C  combined  with
either  a  UVA  or  UVB  sunscreen
improved sun protection as compared to
the  sunscreen  alone.120 Vitamins  C  and
E, in combination, also provided notable
protection from UVB insult, though the
bulk  of  protection  was  attributable  to
vitamin E.

There  are  multiple  studies  that
demonstrate that mice treated with top-
ical vitamin C have less erythema, fewer
sunburn cells, and decreased tumor for-
mation  seen  in  treated  skin  after  UV
exposure.3 Vitamin  C,  a  strong  antioxi-
dant  itself,  also  reduces  (and  therefore
recycles)  oxidized  vitamin  E  back  into
its active form so the antioxidant capa-
bilities  of  vitamin  E  are  amplified  or
regenerated in this way.40

THE  EFFECTS  OF  VITAMIN  C  ON  COLLAGEN
AND  ELASTIN  SYNTHESIS Ascorbate  is  a
cofactor  for  the  enzymatic  activity  of
prolyl  hydroxylase,  an  enzyme  that
hydroxylates prolyl residues in procolla-
gen, elastin, and other proteins with col-
lagenous  domains  prior  to  triple  helix
formation, and thus is required for colla-
gen  synthesis.121 Consequently,  defi-
ciency of ascorbic acid leads to impaired

collagen  production  resulting  in  scurvy.
Elastin  also  contains  hydroxyproline;
however,  prolyl  hydroxylation  is  not
required for the biosynthesis and secre-
tion of elastin,122 and the role of vitamin
C in elastin production is unclear.

The  addition  of  ascorbic  acid  to
fibroblast cultures has been reported to
increase collagen production by increas-
ing the transcription rate of procollagen
genes  and  by  elevating  procollagen
mRNA  levels.123 Although  the  increase
of type I collagen production in cells cul-
tured in the presence of ascorbic acid is
well known, the effects of ascorbate on
other extracellular matrix molecules are
still poorly understood.124

In  fact,  studies  have  suggested  that
concentrations  of  ascorbic  acid  that
maximally  stimulate  collagen  biosyn-
thesis  act  as  an  antagonist  to  elastin
accumulation.125 In  a  series  of  studies,
Bergethon  et  al.126 elaborated  on  these
observations  by  showing  that  elastin
accumulation  was  sharply  diminished 
in cell cultures treated with vitamin C.124
In other words, we know that the addi-
tion  of  ascorbic  acid  to  fibroblast  cul-
tures  increases  production  of  collagen
but  may  decrease  production  of  elastin
by an unknown mechanism.

Clinically  the  relevance  of  these
effects  on  collagen  and  elastin  are  lim-
ited. There is one study in the literature
that  examines  the  effects  of  topically
applied vitamin C on wrinkles.127 In this
study, Cellex-C was shown to decrease
wrinkles  when  applied  topically  for  a
period  of  3  months.  The  patients  were
evaluated  using  photography  assess-
and  optical  profilometry.
ments 
Unfortunately,  this  cannot  be  consid-
ered a blinded study because a large pro-
portion  of  the  patients  experienced
stinging on the side treated with vitamin
C. However, there was a significant dif-
ference  in  the  wrinkles  on  the  treated
side  versus  the  untreated  side.  The
mechanism of action of this difference is
not  understood.  It  might  be  explained
by  increased  collagen  synthesis  or  by
inflammation  and  irritation  induced  by
the product.

Humbert et al. evaluated the effects of
topical vitamin C in healthy photoaged
female volunteers in a double-blind, ran-
domized  trial.  They  topically  applied
cream  containing  5%  vitamin  C  over  a
6-month  period,  comparing  the  action
of the vitamin C cream versus excipient
on photoaged skin. Clinically, a statisti-
cally significant improvement in hydra-
tion,  wrinkles,  glare,  and  brown  spots
was noted. A highly significant increase
in  the  density  of  skin  microrelief  and  a

decrease of the deep furrows were also
demonstrated.  Ultrastructural  evidence
of  the  elastic  tissue  repair  was  docu-
mented. Tissue levels of the inhibitor of
MMP-1  were  increased,  reducing  UV-
induced  collagen  breakdown.  The
mRNA  levels  of  elastin  and  fibrillin
remained unchanged. The topical appli-
cation of 5% vitamin C cream was well
tolerated.128 However,  more  clinical  tri-
als  are  necessary  to  unravel  all  of  the
effects of vitamin C on skin and aging.

VITAMIN C AS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENT
Vitamin C has also been shown to pos-
sess anti-inflammatory activities. In var-
ious cell lines loaded with vitamin C by
incubating  them  with  DHA,  Carcamo 
et  al.  were  able  to  show  a  significant
in  TNF-(cid:7)-induced  nuclear
decrease 
translocation  of  NF-(cid:8)B,  NF-(cid:8)B-depen-
dent  reporter  transcription,  and  I(cid:8)B(cid:7)
phosphorylation,  suggesting  that  intra-
cellular vitamin C can influence inflam-
matory,  neoplastic,  and  apoptotic
processes via inhibition of NF-(cid:8)B activa-
tion. The decrease of inflammation can
lead to a reduction of postinflammatory
hyperpigmentation.

TOPICAL  VITAMIN  C Most  of  the  data
available on the effects of vitamin C are
derived  from  studies  examining  the
effects  of  oral  vitamin  C  or  vitamin  C
applied to tissue cultures. Unfortunately,
there  are  no  studies  that  demonstrate
ingestion  of  oral  vitamin  C
that 
increases the levels of vitamin C in the
skin.  Consequently,  topical  vitamin  C
preparations  have  become  popular.
Ascorbic  acid  can  be  formulated  into
water-  or  lipid-soluble  forms.129 Topical
ascorbyl palmitate, a lipid form, is nonir-
ritating  and  reportedly  photoprotective
and anti-inflammatory.130 Unfortunately,
many of the currently available topical
preparations  are  unable  to  penetrate
the  stratum  corneum  and  are,  conse-
quently,  useless.  Some  manufacturers
claim  that  their  products  are  nonionic
and  less  lipophobic,  enhancing  the
opportunity  for  percutaneous  absorp-
tion.6,131 The aim of these topical prod-
ucts  is  to  deliver  higher  amounts  of
vitamin C to a specific local area of the
skin.  Comparison  of  the  absorption
rate of various topical formulations has
not  yet  been  performed  using  human
subjects.

Another  problem  with  topically
applied ascorbic acid is its lack of stabil-
ity as described above in the chemistry
section.  Because  few  preparations  of
topical  vitamin  C  are  packaged  in  air-
tight containers that are protected from

UV 
radiation,  most  preparations
become  inactive  within  hours  of  open-
ing the bottle.

OTHER COSMETIC APPLICATIONS

Melasma As  vitamin  C  inhibits  the
enzyme  tyrosinase,  it  can  be  used  as  a
depigmenting agent132 (see Chapter 33).
In  the  mid-1990s,  Kameyama  et  al.
found that a stable derivative of ascorbic
acid  produced  a  significant  lightening
effect  in  19  of  34  patients  treated  for
melasma  and  senile  lentigos.114 Among
patients  with  normal  skin,  however,
there was no significant lightening.

Postlaser  erythema In  a  study  of  10
patients  who  underwent  skin  resurfac-
ing with a CO2 laser, vitamin C topically
applied  2  or  more  weeks  after  surgery
decreased  the  duration  and  degree  of
erythema.116

Stretch  marks In  the  late  1990s,  Ash 
et  al.  compared  topical  vitamin  C  in
combination  with  glycolic  acid  to
tretinoin and glycolic acid for the treat-
ment  of  striae  alba.115 Blinded  and
unblinded  observers  determined  that
both  regimens  produced  an  objective
improvement  in  the  striae.  Although
both  regimens  increased  the  epidermal
thickness,  only  the  tretinoin/glycolic
combination augmented the elastin con-
tent of the striae.

SIDE EFFECTS The administration of vita-
min  C,  in  either  oral  or  topical  form,
appears to be safe for human use. In the
studies  reviewed,  a  small  number  of
patients  experienced  minimal  discomfort
(stinging and mild irritation) from the top-
ically  applied  formulations.  The  major
disadvantages of the various formulations
include  high  cost,  questionable  efficacy,
and the possibility of an adverse effect on
elastin production, the clinical significance
of  which  is  currently  unclear.  Ascorbic
acid is a great addition to skin care partic-
ularly  when  patients  insist  on  sun  expo-
sure, cigarette smoking, or other behavior
that contributes to free radical production.
The  practitioner  should  advise  patients,
though, to take the oral form so that they
will  experience  the  same  antioxidant
benefits  in  the  arteries,  liver,  and  other
amenable organs. If it really works, why
limit its effects to the skin?

SUMMARY Vitamin  C  preparations  are
useful  in  preventing  or  lessening  the
harmful  effects  of  UV  radiation  and
ameliorating disorders of hyperpigmen-
tation,  striae,  and  postlaser  erythema.

Topical vitamin C products must be for-
mulated properly and stored in airtight,
light-resistant containers to be effective.
Skinceuticals,  Murad,  and  La  Roche-
Posay  have  formulated  the  most  effec-
tive vitamin C-containing products.

Green Tea 

Green tea has been consumed as a popu-
lar beverage in Asian countries, in particu-
lar,  and  throughout  the  world  for  many
years. It has recently gained greater popu-
larity in western nations, though, because
of  its  purported  antioxidant  and  anticar-
cinogenic effects. There are numerous in
vitro and in vivo studies on the effects of
green tea on the skin; in fact, green tea is
one  of  the  most  studied  antioxidants.133
Besides its antioxidant activity, green tea
polyphenols  possess  anti-inflammatory
and anticarcinogenic properties and mod-
ulate  the  biochemical  pathways  impor-
tant  in  cell  proliferation,  when  adminis-
tered either topically or orally.134,135

Polyphenols are a large, diverse family
of  thousands  of  chemical  substances
found  in  plants.  Significantly,  many  of
them are strong antioxidants (Table 34-1).
There are four major polyphenolic cate-
chins in green tea: ECG [(-)EpiCatechin-
3-O-Gallate],  GCG  [(-)GalloCatechin-3-
O-Gallate],  EGCG  [(-)EpiGalloCatechin
-3-O-Gallate],  and  EGC  [(-)EpiGallo
Catechin]. EGCG is the most abundant
and  biologically  active  component 
(Fig. 34-5). Special preparation of the tea
plant ensures that the antioxidant activi-
ties of these polyphenols are preserved.
White  tea,  like  green  tea,  comes  from
the  Camellia  sinensis plant.  However,
white tea is more expensive because it is
harder  to  obtain.  White  tea  actually
comes  from  the  tips  of  the  green  tea
leaves  or  from  leaves  that  are  not  yet
fully open and the buds are still covered
by  fine  white  hair.  EGCG  is  the  main
compound  in  green  and  white  tea
responsible for antioxidant activity.136,137
When evaluating the utility of a skin care
product,  it  is  necessary  to  know  which
polyphenols are in the product. EGCG is
the  most  potent  form  of  green  tea
polyphenols. In addition, it is necessary
to  know  what  percent  of  polyphenols

are  in  the  product.  The  most  effective
products contain 50% to 90% polyphe-
nols. Such formulations are dark in color
and look brown when they contain this
high level of polyphenols. The Replenix
line by Topix is an example of a product
line with a high level of polyphenols.

PHOTOPROTECTION BY GREEN TEA In early
studies,  green  tea  polyphenols  were
shown  to  suppress  chemical-  and  UV-
induced  carcinogenesis  when  fed  orally
or applied topically in hairless or Sencar
mice.138–140 Other  studies  have  con-
firmed these results and shown EGCG to
be a potent suppressor of photocarcino-
genesis.141 The  profound  photoprotec-
tive effects of topically applied green tea
polyphenols  (GTPs)  have  also  been
observed in human skin, demonstrating
a  dose-dependent  reduction  of  UV-
induced erythema, decrease in the num-
ber of sunburn cells, protection of epider-
mal  Langerhans  cells,  and  limitation  of
DNA-damage.142 Recent  studies  have
demonstrated that GTPs scavenge ROS,
stabilizing  GPX,  catalase,  and  glu-
tathione, as well as inhibiting nitric oxide
synthase,  lipoxygenase,  COX  and  xan-
thine  oxidase,  and  lipid  peroxidase.  In
addition,  they  act  as  modulators  of  dif-
ferent gene groups and signal pathways.

MOLECULAR  MECHANISMS  OF  GREEN  TEA
Molecular targets of GTPs include among
others Ras and AP-1, both of which are
involved  in  the  MAPK  pathway.143 The
antiapoptotic  effects  of  EGCG  on  UVB-

IL-12  production, 

irradiated  keratinocytes  seem  to  be
induced by an increase in the expression
of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 and a
decrease  in  the  proapoptotic  protein
Bax.144 EGCG has further been shown to
reduce  UV-induced  immunosuppression
by limiting IL-10 production and increas-
ing 
two  major
cytokines  that  mediate  UV-induced
immunosupression.145 In  addition,  the
EGCG-induced IL-12 increase leads to an
augmented  synthesis  of  enzymes  that
repair UV-induced DNA damage.146 Also,
EGCG  seems  to  reduce  UVB-induced
immunosuppression  by  decreasing
CD11b,  a  cell  surface  marker  for  acti-
vated  macrophages  and  neutrophils  in
animals  treated  with  UVB.147 In  mice,
EGCG has been shown to downregulate
UV-induced expression of AP-1 and NF-
(cid:8)B  and  suppress  MMPs,  which  are
known  to  degrade  collagen  resulting  in
photodamage.148 Prevention  of  UV-
induced oxidative damage and induction
of MMPs has been demonstrated in vivo
in mouse skin. In the study, GTPs were
administered in drinking water to SKH-1
hairless  mice,  which  were  thereafter
exposed  to  multiple  doses  of  UVB 
(90  mJ/cm2,  for  2  months  on  alternate
days).  Treatment  with  GTPs  resulted  in
inhibition of UVB-induced protein oxida-
tion in vivo in mouse skin, which could
also be observed in vitro in human skin
fibroblast HS68 cells. Further, oral admin-
istration  of  GTPs  was  shown  to  inhibit
UVB-induced  expression  of  matrix-
degrading MMPs in hairless mouse skin,
supporting the role of GTPs as antipho-
toaging compounds.148

GREEN TEA USE IN HUMANS In contrast to
the  amount  of  scientific  data  on  GTPs,
there are limited studies in human skin
examining  the  topical  application  of
green  tea-containing  products.  This  is
likely caused by the difficulty of design-
ing  a  study  to  measure  the  preventive
effects  of  green  tea  on  aging  skin.
Nevertheless, applying topical GTPs in
the morning in combination with tradi-
tional sunscreens seems to make sense
and is thought to have the potential to
protect the skin from UV-induced dam-
age. In addition, topical green tea, as is

the  case  with  other  antioxidants,  may
improve  rosacea,  prevent  retinoid  der-
matitis,  and  play  a  role  in  managing
pigmentation disorders. There are many
products  containing  green  tea  that  can
be obtained OTC. Most of the products,
however,  have  not  been  tested  in  con-
trolled  clinical  trials  and  the  concentra-
tion of polyphenols in these products is
too  low  to  demonstrate  efficacy.  It  is
crucial to know the amount of GTPs in a
formulation to judge its efficacy.

Silymarin 

Silymarin  is  a  naturally-occurring  poly-
phenolic  flavonoid  compound  derived
from  the  seeds  of  the  milk  thistle  plant
Silybum marianum. Milk thistle has been
used  for  medicinal  purposes  for  more
than  2000  years.  Today,  it  is  used  in
Europe  and  Asia  as  an  antihepatotoxic
agent and is available as a supplement in
Europe  and  the  US.  The  main  compo-
nent  of  silymarin  is  silybin  (silibinin),
which is considered to be the most bio-
logically active component in terms of its
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-
carcinogenic properties149 (Fig. 34–6).

PHOTOPROTECTION Topical  application  of
silybin prior to, or immediately after, UV
irradiation  has  been  found  to  impart
strong  protection  against  UV-induced
damage in the epidermis by a reduction
in  thymine  dimer-positive  cells  and  an
upregulation  of  p53-p21/Cip1,  which
researchers believe may lead to inhibition
of  cell  proliferation  and  apoptosis.  This
study  suggests  that  mechanisms  other
than sunscreen effect are integral to sily-
bin efficacy against UV-caused skin dam-
ages.150 Researchers have also noted that
silybin enhances UVB-induced apoptosis
and speculated that it acts as a UVB dam-
age sensor to confer its biologic action.151
The antioxidant activity of silymarin is
well established. Chemoprotective activity
against skin cancer has also been reported
and  continues  to  be  the  subject  of  much
investigation.152–154 In  a  study  to  identify
the  mechanism  of  photocarcinogenesis

treatment  of  silymarin,  prevention  of

UVB-induced  immunosuppression  and
oxidative stress were found to be poten-
tially related to the prevention of photo-
carcinogenesis  in  mice.155 Authors  con-
cluded  from  this  trial  and  related  data
from  other  recent  studies  that  there  are
compelling  arguments  for  the  inclusion
of  silymarin  in  sunscreens  or  in  other
products in a skin care regimen.

MODE  OF  ADMINISTRATION Most  of  the
milk thistle or silymarin available in the
US  comes  in  the  form  of  oral  supple-
ments.  These  may  inactivate  oral  con-
traceptives.  Topical  formulations  are
available  from  SkinCeuticals.  Silymarin
has been used in topical formulations to
treat rosacea.156

Coffea Arabica and 
Coffeeberry Extract 

The  coffee  plant  Coffea  arabica is  the
source  of  the  globally  consumed  coffee
beverage,  originating  from  Ethiopia  and
cultivated throughout the world. Extracts
of the beans of the coffee plant have been
shown  to  exhibit  antioxidant  activity
after  roasting157 (Fig.  34-7).  Besides  the
coffee beans, the fruit of the coffee plant,

especially  when  harvested  in  a  sub-
ripened state, also possesses peak antioxi-
dant  activity,  by  dint  of  its  constituent
polyphenols,  especially  chlorogenic  acid,
condensed  proanthocyanidins,  quinic
acid,  and  ferulic  acid.  Coffeeberry  is  the
proprietary name for the antioxidant that
is  extracted  from  the  fruit  of  Coffea  ara-
bica.  In  the  oxygen  radical  absorbance
capacity  assay  (ORAC),  Coffeeberry  has
demonstrated higher antioxidant activity
than  green  tea,  pomegranate  extract,  as
well as vitamins C and E.158 Polyphenols,
which can be found in coffee beans, green
and  black  tea,  various  fruits,  vegetables
and grains, are known to impart multiple
health  benefits,  mainly  because  of  their
anti-inflammatory  and  antioxidant  prop-
erties.159,160 In  2007,  Stiefel  Laboratories
launched  the  product  line  RevaléSkin,
which  contains  1%  coffeeberry  poly-
phenols. To build on some promising lab-
oratory  results,  clinical  studies  assessing
the antioxidant effects of topical prepara-
tions  containing  C.  arabica and  coffee-
berry extract are needed.

Polypodium Leucotomos

Polypodium  leucotomos (PL)  is  an  extract
derived from the fern family. It is an oral
photoprotectant  with  strong  antioxidant
properties. Its major phenolic components
have  been  shown  to  be  3,4-dihydroxy-
benzoic  acid,  4-hydroxybenzoic  acid,
vanillic  acid,  caffeic  acid,  4-hydroxy-
cinnamic  acid,  4-hydroxycinnamoyl-
quinic acid, ferulic acid, and five chloro-
genic  acid  isomers.161
In  traditional
leucotomos
medicine,  polypodium 
extract  (PLE)  has  been  used  for  various

 
 
 
indications,  including  psoriasis,  atopic
dermatitis, vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis,
and tumors and, recently, PLE has been
demonstrated to exhibit immunomodu-
latory activity in vitro and in vivo.162

PHOTOPROTECTION The  photoprotective
effect of PL has been shown for topical or
oral  administration  in  various  studies.163
In a study by Gonzáles et al., 21 healthy
volunteers,  either  untreated  or  treated
with  oral  psoralens  (8-MOP  or  5-MOP),
were enrolled and exposed to solar radia-
tion. Immediate pigment darkening (IPD),
MED, minimal melanogenic dose (MMD),
and  minimal  phototoxic  dose  (MPD)
before and after topical or oral administra-
tion of PL were evaluated. PL was found
to be photoprotective after topical appli-
cation  as  well  as  oral  administration
showing  a  prevention  of  acute  sunburn
and  psoralen-induced  phototoxic  reac-
tions.  Immunohistochemistry  revealed
photoprotection  of  Langherhans  cells  by
oral as well as topical PL.164

ANTIOXIDATIVE EFFECTS The antioxidant
effects of PL have been demonstrated in
vitro and in vivo, as well as for the pre-
vention  of  photoaging.165,166 Gonzáles
et al. showed that PL manifests photo-
protective effects in vivo and in vitro by
its ability to suppress free radical gener-
ation,  prevent  photodecomposition  of
both endogenous photoprotective mole-
cules and DNA, and inhibit UV-induced
cell death.167 Oral administration of PLE
has  proven  to  have  photoprotective
effects  in  various  studies.  It  has  been
shown  to  decrease  sunburn  and  UV-
induced mast cell inﬁltration in the skin,
and  reduce  the 
loss  of  epidermal
Langerhans  cells  of  the  skin  associated
with  UV  exposure.168,169 Caccialanza 
et al. exposed 26 patients with polymor-
phic  light  eruption  and  two  with  solar
urticaria  to  sunlight  while  directing
them to consume 480 mg/d of PL orally
through the study. The response of the
skin to sunlight was compared with that
occurring  previously  without  adminis-
tration  of  PL,  and  showed  statistically
significant  reduction  of  skin  reaction
and subjective symptoms.170

MOLECULAR  MECHANISM The  molecular
mechanisms  of  the  photoprotective
effects  of  PL  have  been  investigated  in
vitro  using  a  solar  simulator  as  UV
source  in  human  keratinocytes.  The
results showed that the photoprotective
effects of PL seem to involve inhibition
of TNF-(cid:7), nitric oxide (NO) production,
and  inducible  nitric  oxide  synthase
(iNOS)  upregulation  induced  by  UV

light  and  the  modulation  of  the  tran-
scriptional  activation  of  AP-1  and  NF-
(cid:8)B,  two  proinflammatory  transcription
factors induced by UV-radiation. Finally,
it  was  demonstrated  that  PL  prevents
cytotoxic  damage 
apoptosis
induced by UV light in HaCaT cells.171

and 

SUMMARY It  appears  that  the  dermato-
logic  potential  of  this  tropical  plant
extract  is  being  harnessed  in  clinical
applications for the treatment of sunburn
and  the  inhibition  of  the  phototoxic
reaction, as well as for the prevention of
photoaging.165,172,173 Experimental data
support  the  inclusion  of  PL  extract  in
sunscreen  formulations.174 This  ingre-
dient  is  currently  only  available  as  an
oral  supplement  in  the  US  under  the
brand  name  Heliocare  and  is  sold  by
the company OPKO Health Inc. One to
two  capsules  of  Heliocare  should  be
taken  1  hour  prior  to  sun  exposure.  It
should  be  used  in  conjunction  with 
a  broad-spectrum  sunscreen.  At  this
time, there are no topical formulations
of this ingredient.

Resveratrol 
Resveratrol  (trans-3,5,4(cid:11)-trihydroxystil-
bene)  is  a  polyphenolic  phytoalexin 
compound found in the skin and seeds of
grapes,  berries,  peanuts,  red  wine,  and
other  foods  and  has  been  reported  to
exhibit a wide range of biologic and phar-
macologic  properties.175 It  exists  in  two
isoforms: trans-resveratrol and cis-resvera-
trol  where  the  trans-isomer  is  the  more
stable  form  (Fig.  34-8).  Resveratrol  is  a
potent  antioxidant  with  antiproliferative
and anti-inﬂammatory properties.149,176,177
In vitro and in vivo studies have demon-
strated  that  resveratrol  exhibits  chemo-
preventive  and  antiproliferative  activity
against  various  cancers,  including  skin
cancer,  by  exerting  inhibitory  effects  on
diverse  cellular  events  associated  with
tumor initiation, promotion, and progres-
sion  and  triggering  apoptosis  in  such
tumor cells.178–180

MOLECULAR  MECHANISMS  OF  PHOTOPRO-
TECTION In recent studies resveratrol has
been  shown  to  protect  against  UVB-

mediated  cutaneous  damages  in  SKH-1
hairless  mice.  Topical  application  of
resveratrol to SKH-1 hairless mice prior
to  UVB  irradiation  resulted  in  a  signi-
ﬁcant decrease in UVB-mediated genera-
tion  of  H2O2 as  well  as  inﬁltration  of
leukocytes and inhibition of skin edema.
Also,  topical  application  of  resveratrol
has  been  found  to  significantly  inhibit
UVB-mediated induction of COX-2 and
ODC  enzyme  activities  and  protein
expression  of  ODC,  which  are  well-
established  markers  for  tumor  promo-
tion. Resveratrol further seems to inhibit
the UVB-mediated increase of lipid per-
oxidation,  a  marker  of  oxidative
stress.176,181,182 In  one  study,  pretreat-
ment  of  normal  human  epidermal  ker-
atinocytes  (NHEK)  with  resveratrol
inhibited UVB-induced activation of the
NF-(cid:8)B pathway.177 This protective effect
of  resveratrol  against  the  damage  of
multiple  UVB-exposure  was  suggested
to  be  associated  with  inhibition  of  the
MAPK pathway and mediated via mod-
ulation in the expression and function of
the  cell  cycle 
regulatory  protein
cki–cyclin–cdk  network.183 Further,  in
short-term  experiments,  the  topical
application of resveratrol to SKH-1 hair-
less mouse skin prior to UVB irradiation
resulted  in  signiﬁcant  inhibition  of  cell
proliferation  and  phosphorylation  of
survivin.181 Long-term  studies  have
demonstrated  that  topical  application
with  resveratrol  (both  pre-  and  post-
treatment) results in inhibition of UVB-
induced  tumor  incidence  and  delay  in
the  onset  of  skin  tumorigenesis.182 The
posttreatment  of  resveratrol  imparted
equal  protection  to  the  pretreatment,
suggesting  that  resveratrol-mediated
responses may not be sunscreen effects.

SUMMARY Data  and  clinical  evidence
seem to be promising enough to regard
resveratrol  as  suitable  for  inclusion  in
various  product  types  (e.g.,  emollients,
patches, sunscreens, and other skin care
products) intended to prevent skin can-
cer  and  other  conditions  thought  to  be
generated by the sun.

Grape Seed Extract 

Grapes, also known as Vitis vinifera, are
globally consumed fruits and the source
of  wine.  The  extract  prepared  from
grape  seeds  is  rich  in  proanthocyani-
dins,  which  belong  to  the  polyphenolic
flavonoid family. Specifically, grape seed
proanthocyanidins  are  oligomers  and
polymers  of  polyhydroxy  flavan-3-ol
units,  such  as  ((cid:4))-catechin  and  ((cid:5))-epi-
catechin,  which  are  present  in  large

amounts in the polyphenols of red wine
and grape seeds. Sixty to seventy percent
of the polyphenols are found in the seeds
of  the  grapes.184,185 Proanthocyanidins
are  believed  to  exhibit  a  wide  range  of
biologic,  pharmacologic,  chemoprotec-
tive, and antioxidant activities.186

ANTIOXIDANT  ACTIVITY Various  studies
have reported on the potent antioxidative
and  free  radical  scavenging  activities  of
proanthocyanidins.187–191 Grape  seed
extract  has  been  shown  to  be  an  even
stronger  scavenger  of  free  radicals  than
vitamins  C  and  E.192 Dietary  intake  of
grape  seed  proanthocyanidins  (GSP)  has
been  shown  to  inhibit  UV-induced  skin
cancer  in  mice.193 Mittal  et  al.  demon-
strated that oral intake of GSP in SKH-1
hairless  mice  resulted  in  prevention  of
photocarcinogenesis with reduced tumor
incidence, multiplicity, and size compared
with  non-GSP–treated  mice  following  a
UVB-induced  carcinogenesis  protocol.
Biochemical  analysis  revealed  that  treat-
ment of GSP in in vivo and in vitro sys-
tems significantly inhibited UVB- or Fe3(cid:4)
-
induced  lipid  peroxidation,  suggesting  a
possible  antioxidant  mechanism  of  pho-
toprotection by GSP.193 In another study,
investigators  demonstrated  that  treat-
ment  of  NHEK  with  GPS  inhibited  UV-
induced  oxidative  stress  by  inhibiting
UVB-induced  H2O2,  lipid  peroxidation,
protein  oxidation,  and  DNA  damage  as
well as scavenging hydroxyl radicals and
superoxide  anions  in  a  cell-free  system.
Moreover,  GSP  also  inhibited  UVB-
induced depletion of antioxidant defense
components,  such  as  GPX,  catalase,
superoxide  dismutase,  and  glutathione.
Treatment  of  NHEK  with  GSP  further
inhibited  UVB-induced  phosphorylation
of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 proteins of the
MAPK  family.194 As  UV-induced  oxida-
tive  stress  mediates  activation  of  MAPK
and NF-(cid:8)B signaling pathways, the same
group  further  examined  the  effect  of
dietary  GSP  on  these  pathways  and
proved  that  GSP  exhibits  the  ability  to
protect the skin from the adverse effects
of  UVB  radiation  via  modulation  of  the
MAPK  and  NF-(cid:8)B  signaling  pathways.
This  provides  a  molecular  basis  for  the
photoprotective  effects  of  grape  seed
extract  in  an  in  vivo  animal  model.195
Dietary GSP was also shown to modulate
UVB-induced  immunosuppression  by
immunosuppressive
reducing 
cytokine  IL-10  while  enhancing  the  pro-
duction  of 
immunostimulatory
cytokine IL-12, suggesting this to be one
of  the  possible  mechanisms  by  which
grape seed extract prevents photocarcino-
genesis in mice.196

the 

GRAPE  SEED  EXTRACT  APPLICATIONS  IN
HUMANS Thus far, there are no compara-
ble  studies  in  humans.  Grape  seed
extract  is  included  in  topical  cosmetic
formulations  with  the  intention  of
imparting an antiaging effect. It is a pop-
ular  ingredient  in  “organic”  products.
However, additional studies are needed
to  further  understand  its  effects  on
human skin when used topically.

Pomegranate

Pomegranate (Punica granatum) is an edi-
ble  fruit  native  to  northern  India,  Iran,
Pakistan, and Afghanistan and cultivated
in many countries. The fruits are widely
consumed in fresh and beverage forms as
juice.  The  pomegranate  was  one  of  the
ﬁrst known sources of medicines and has
been  used  extensively  in  many  cultures
around  the  world  for  various  diseases,
such as skin inﬂammation, rheumatism,
and  sore  throats.197 In  Ayurvedic  medi-
cine,  pomegranates  reputedly  nourish
and  restore  balance  to  the  skin.  The
extract of the fruit contains two types of
polyphenolic  compounds:  anthocyanins
(such  as  delphinidin,  cyanidin,  and
pelargonidin),  as  well  as  hydrolyzable
tannins (such as punicalin, pedunculagin,
punicalagin,  as  well  as  gallagic  and
ellagic acid esters of glucose).

in 

ANTIOXIDANT  ACTIVITY Extracts  can  be
obtained from various parts of the fruit,
such  as  the  juice,  seed,  and  peel  and
have  been  reported  to  have  strong
antioxidant  activity.198–200 The  phenolic
components  extracted  from  pomegran-
ate have been shown to possess strong
antioxidant  properties 
several
instances.201 A  recent  study  compared
the antioxidant potency of various bev-
erages known to be rich in polyphenols,
including  pomegranate  juice,  applying
four  tests  of  antioxidant  strength.
Compared to various fruit juices (apple,
açaí,  black  cherry,  blueberry,  cranberry,
orange),  red  wines  as  well  as  black,
green and white tea, pomegranate juice
displayed 
the  greatest  antioxidant
potency  and  was  at  least  20%  stronger
than any of the other beverages tested202
(Table  34-2).  Also,  other  studies  have
reported  that  pomegranate  imparts  a
more  potent  antioxidant  effect  than
comparable  quantities  of  green  tea  and
red  wine.198,203 With  regard  to  topical
application,  a  methanolic  extract  of
pomegranate  peel  followed  by  carbon
tetrachloride  was  demonstrated  to
restore  catalase,  peroxidase,  and  super-
oxide  dismutase  enzyme  activities  in
rats.204

PHOTOPROTECTION There  have  been
numerous  reports  on  the  in  vitro  and  in
vivo  anticancer  properties  of  pomegran-
ates.205,206 Pomegranate  fruit  extract  has
been demonstrated to exert photochemo-
preventive properties, ameliorating UVA-
mediated damages by modulating cellular
pathways.207 The  seed  oil  of  the  pome-
granate  fruit  has  been  shown  to  possess
chemopreventive  activity  against  skin
cancer.208 In  a  recent  study,  Afaq  et  al.
showed that topically applied pomegran-
ate  fruit  extract  (PFE)  possesses  antiskin
tumor-promoting  effects  in  a  CD-1
mouse  model  of  chemical  carcino-
genesis.201 They further studied the effect
of PFE on UVB-induced adverse effects in
NHEK  and  showed  that  PFE  protects
against the adverse effects of UVB radia-
tion by inhibiting UVB-induced modula-
tions  of  NF-(cid:8)B  and  MAPK  pathways.209
The  same  group  then  investigated  the
effect  of  polyphenol-rich  PFE  on  UVB-
induced  oxidative  stress  and  photoaging
in  human  immortalized  HaCaT  ker-
atinocytes, showing that pretreatment of
HaCaT  cells  with  PFE  inhibited  UVB-
mediated  reduction  in  cell  viability  and

intracellular glutathione content as well as
an  increase  in  lipid  peroxidation.  It  also
inhibited  the  upregulation  of  various
MMPs,  and  phosphorylation  of  MAPKs.
These  results  suggest  that  PFE  protects
HaCaT cells against UVB-induced oxida-
tive stress and markers of photoaging and
could be a useful supplement in skin care
products.210 This is buttressed by further
in  vitro  studies  that  suggest  that  pome-
granate peel fractions may promote der-
mal regeneration while pomegranate seed
oil fractions may foster epidermal regener-
ation, presenting potential additional der-
matologic  applications.211 Pomegranate
extract is already available OTC in various
skin care products.

THE FAT- AND
WATER-SOLUBLE ANTIOXIDANT

The sole network antioxidant known to
be both water and lipid soluble is lipoic
acid.

Alpha Lipoic Acid

Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant
agent  used  for  the  treatment  and 
prevention of aging skin.212 It is different
than  the  other  antioxidants  because  it
can be used as a superficial chemical peel
to resurface the skin in a manner similar
to glycolic acid. ALA is believed to have
anti-inflammatory  properties  that  may
also  make  it  useful  in  the  treatment  of
postlaser  erythema.213 This  discussion
will  focus  on  the  science  and  potential
therapeutic  applications  of  ALA  in  the
cosmetic dermatology practice.

CHEMICAL  COMPOSITION ALA,  formerly
called  thioctic  acid,  is  an  octanoic  acid,
which means an eight-carbon version of
carboxylic acid combined with cysteine
(Fig.  34-9).  It  is  an  essential  cofactor  in
mitochondrial  dehydrogenases.214
In
1951,  it  was  first  discovered  that  ALA
acted as an antioxidant. It is both water-
and  lipid-soluble  and,  hence,  has  been
termed  the  “universal”  antioxidant.215
Other  popular  antioxidants  are  either
lipophilic,  such  as  vitamin  E,  or
hydrophilic, such as vitamin C.

PENETRATION INTO THE STRATUM CORNEUM
Dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) is formed by
reducing  ALA.  It  has  a  more  powerful

antioxidative  effect  than  does  ALA.
DHLA  is  very  unstable,  however,  and
would  get  oxidized  in  a  matter  of  min-
utes after application to the skin. ALA has
become popular because it is absorbed in
a stable form and after it enters the cells,
it is immediately converted to DHLA.216
Podda et al. studied the capacity of ALA
to penetrate the skin in anesthetized hair-
less mice after application of a 5% solu-
tion  in  propylene  glycol  for  0.5  to  4
hours.  They  showed  the  rate  of  ALA
absorption into the skin to be constant by
30 minutes after application, reaching the
maximum  concentration  by  the  2-hour
mark.217

treated  with 

TOPICAL APPLICATION Topical application
of 3% ALA in a lecithin base to human
skin  has  been  shown  to  decrease  UVB-
induced erythema in one-half the time of
lesions 
lecithin  base
alone.217 This model indicated that topi-
cal  application  of  ALA  could  prevent 
free radical damage to skin, and thus pre-
vent  photoaging  and  carcinogenesis.218
Although ALA is available in topical cos-
metic products and in formulations used
for  office  peels,  there  are  no  published
peer-reviewed  clinical  trials  examining
the efficacy of these products.

SYSTEMIC  ADMINISTRATION ALA  can  be
used  either  topically  or  systemically.
When systemically administered, it has
been  used  to  influence  glucose  control
and  prevent  chronic  hyperglycemia-
associated  complications  such  as  dia-
betes  mellitus,  Alzheimer’s  disease,
cataracts,  HIV  activation,  and  radiation
injury.212,219 ALA  has  also  been  used 
as  adjuvant  therapy  for  glaucoma,
ischemia-reperfusion  injury,  amanita
mushroom poisoning, cellular oxidative
damage,220 and Chagas disease.221 There
is  no  currently  established  RDA  but
most  proponents  of  ALA  supplementa-
tion suggest 25 to 500 mg daily.

ANTIOXIDATIVE  BENEFITS There  are  four
principal  antioxidative  properties  of
ALA: metal chelating capacity, ability to
scavenge  ROS,  ability  to  regenerate
endogenous  antioxidants,222,223 and  the
ability to repair oxidative damage.224

ALA  is  available  in  different  forms
and vehicles and currently marketed in
cleansers, moisturizers, and oral supple-
ments. When starting patients on ALA-
containing  products,  they  should  be
warned that they may feel a slight tin-
gling sensation, which decreases after a
few  seconds  and  disappears  within
minutes of application. Topical applica-
tion  of  ALA  is  recommended  every

other day for the first week, increasing
to twice a day for the third week if no
side effects occur. ALA can cause a sig-
nificant  amount  of  inflammation  so
these  patients  should  be  followed
closely.  Fine  skin  lines  may  improve
after  a  few  weeks;  however,  this  may
be  caused  by  the  resultant  inflamma-
tion.  Contact  dermatitis  to  ALA  has
been reported.225

SUMMARY ALA exhibits antioxidant and
exfoliating properties that may render it
a  good  choice  for  resistant  skin  types
with a tendency to wrinkle (see Chapter
9). Please note, though, that the status of
ALA  as  a  topical  antioxidant  has
recently  been  called  into  question  (see
Chapter 33).

OTHER ANTIOXIDANTS

Genistein 
Genistein  (4(cid:11),5,7-tri-hydroxyisoflavone),
derived from and an active constituent in
soybeans, is an isoﬂavone, thus a member
of the polyphenol family. It was first iso-
lated from soybeans in 1931. The recent
heightened awareness of this potent com-
pound can mostly be attributed to the fact
that in the Asian population various posi-
tive beneﬁcial health effects have been at
least in part attributed to their increased
soy  consumption.226 Most  importantly,
Asians  show  signiﬁcantly  lower  inci-
dences  in  breast,  colon,  and  prostate 
cancers  when  compared  to  western 
populations.227–230

Although  soybeans  contain  several
ingredients  with  demonstrated  anti-
cancer  activities,  genistein  is  its  most
important  component231 (Fig.  34-10).
Genistein  is  known  to  possess  various
biologic activities, such as helping in the
treatment and prevention of certain car-
diovascular conditions and osteoporosis,
as well as enhancing the effects of radia-
tion  in  the  treatment  of  prostate  and
breast cancer.232 Its classiﬁcation as a phy-
toestrogen accounts for additional health
beneﬁts including the modulation of per-
imenopausal  symptoms  without  the
associated  dangers  of  hormone  replace-
ment therapy.233,234

BIOLOGIC  EFFECTS Genistein  is  a  potent
antioxidant  and  its  anticarcinogenic
effects  are  well  documented  on  several
skin.235–237
cancers, 
The  capacity  of  genistein  to  inhibit 
UV-induced  oxidative  DNA  damage  as
well  as  block  UV-induced  c-Fos  and  c-
Jun proto-oncogene expression has been
demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.238–241
Genistein,  either  topically  applied  or
orally supplemented, has been shown to
inhibit UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis
in mice and substantially block the sub-
acute  and  chronic  UVB-induced  cuta-
neous damage and histologic alterations
related  to  photoaging.  The  possible
mechanisms  of  the  anticarcinogenic
action  include  scavenging  of  ROS,
blocking of oxidative and photodynamic
damage  to  DNA,  inhibition  of  tyrosine
protein  kinase,  downregulation  of  epi-
dermal  growth  factor  (EGF)-receptor
phosphorylation  and  MAPK  activation,
and suppression of oncoprotein expres-
sion  in  UVB-irradiated  cells  and  mouse
skin.232 In  addition,  the  treatment  of
human  keratinocyte  cell  line  NCTC
2544  with  genistein  has  been  docu-
mented  to  limit  lipid  peroxidation  and
increases  in  ROS  formation.242 The
potent chemopreventive effect of UVB-
induced  skin  carcinogenesis  in  human
skin  was  examined  by  assessing  both
cutaneous  erythema  and  discomfort,
which  was  signiﬁcantly  inhibited  by
pre-UVB  application  of  genistein,  sug-
gesting  that  genistein  effectively  pro-
tects  human  skin  against  UVB-induced
skin  photodamage.  Genistein  has  also
been  demonstrated  to  protect  mouse
skin  against  photodamage  induced  by
psoralen plus UVA (PUVA).

SUMMARY In  summary,  genistein  sub-
stantially  inhibits  skin  carcinogenesis
and  cutaneous  aging  induced  by  UV
light  in  mice  and  photodamage  in
humans.  Supported  by  extensive  data,
the  soybean  isoﬂavone  genistein  is
thought to offer promising applications
in  the  ﬁeld  of  the  prevention  of  UV-
induced skin cancer and photoaging. In
fact, genistein is already included in var-
ious  products  such  as  facial  moisturiz-
ers,  sunscreens,  and  several  skin  care
formulations claiming antiaging effects.

Pycnogenol

procyanidins, also called proanthocyani-
dins.  Proanthocyanidins,  as  mentioned
above  (see  Grape  Seed  Extract  section),
are potent free radical scavengers that can
also  be  found  in  grape  seed,  grape  skin,
bilberry,  cranberry,  black  currant,  green
tea,  black  tea,  blueberry,  blackberry,
strawberry,  black  cherry,  red  wine,  and
red cabbage.243 Pycnogenol is utilized as a
nutritional  supplement  and  a  phyto-
chemical remedy for various disorders, as
it  possesses  potent  antioxidant,  anti-
inflammatory,  and  anticarcinogenic 
properties.244,245 A large body of literature
on the free radical scavenging activity of
pycnogenol exists.246

In  a  recent  in  vitro  study,  the  antiox-
idative effects of pycnogenol were again
confirmed. In addition, the investigators
showed statistically signiﬁcant antimuta-
genic  properties  with  a  correlation
between  the  antioxidant  and  antimuta-
genic activities. They thus hypothesized
that  the  antimutagenic  effect  of  pyc-
nogenol is most likely attributable to its
antioxidant  properties.247 In  humans  it
has  been  demonstrated  that  following
oral  supplementation  with  pycnogenol,
the  antioxidant  capacity  of  plasma  was
significantly increased, as determined by
ORAC.248 The anticarcinogenic effect of
pycnogenol was shown by topical appli-
cation  of  0.05%  to  0.2%  pycnogenol  to
the irradiated dorsal skin of Skh:hr hair-
less  mice  exposed  daily  to  minimally
inﬂammatory  solar-simulated  UV  radia-
tion.  A  reduction  of  the  inflammatory
sunburn reaction erythema and immuno-
suppression  was  observed.  Further,
tumor formation was delayed and preva-
lence  reduced.245 The  potential  of  pyc-
nogenol  to  confer  photoprotection  for
humans has been investigated by Saliou
et  al.  They  showed  in  humans  that  by
oral  supplementation  of  pycnogenol  the
UV radiation level necessary to reach one
MED  was  significantly  elevated.  They
further  suggested  that  inhibition  of  NF-
(cid:8)B-dependent  gene  expression  by  pyc-
nogenol might possibly contribute to the
observed  increase  in  MED.249 Finally,
pycnogenol exerts depigmenting effects,
which are described in detail in Chapter
33.  Thus,  pycnogenol  is  a  safe  natural
product  that  is  included  in  various  skin
care products. Further clinical studies are
necessary  to  elucidate  its  efficacy  when
used in humans.

Pycnogenol  is  the  patented  name  for  a
standardized  pine  bark  extract  of  the
French  maritime  pine  (Pinus  pinaster).  It 
is  rich  in  condensed  flavonoids  and
monomeric phenolic compounds, includ-
ing  catechin,  epicatechin,  taxifolin,  and

Dehydroepiandrosterone

Dehydroepiandrosterone  (DHEA)  is
believed  to  be  a  powerful  endogenous
antioxidant.  However,  its  antioxidant
abilities  remain  unproven.  DHEA  pur-

304

portedly  protects  against  aging  and
stimulates the immune system. The use
of  DHEA  to  combat  aging  is  based  on
the fact that the secretion and blood lev-
els  of  DHEA  and  its  sulfate  ester
(DHEAS)  diminish  profoundly  with
age.  Although  the  FDA  noted  in  1985
that  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  DHEA
has  never  been  confirmed,  the  agent
continues  to  be  sold  OTC  and  is  dis-
cussed in many lay publications.

A  study  evaluating  the  safety  of  oral
DHEA  and  its  effects  was  published  in
April  2000.250
In  this  double-blind,
placebo-controlled  study,  280  healthy
individuals  consumed  50  mg  DHEA  or
placebo  daily  for  a  year.  The  subjects
given  DHEA  had  slightly  elevated 
levels  of  testosterone  and  estradiol.
Interestingly,  the  treated  patients  exhib-
ited increases in sebum production, skin
surface  hydration,  and  epidermal  thick-
ness as well as decreased facial pigmenta-
tion. No harmful effects of DHEAS were
noted. DHEA may protect cells from UV
damage as well. A study by Coach et al.
assessed  whether  pretreatment  of  cells
with various doses of DHEA could pro-
tect the cells from the damaging effects of
UV  radiation.251 Cellular  damage,  cell
counts, and cell morphology were evalu-
ated.  They  found  that  the  morphologic
evaluation  of  the  cells  treated  with  UV
radiation showed an increase in degener-
ation of chromatin and a decrease in cell
size  as  compared  to  nontreated  groups,
indicating  that  DHEA  was  efficient  in
protecting  the  cells  from  UV  damage.
Other reported effects of orally adminis-
tered  DHEA  in  healthy  men  include
reduction of body fat, increase in muscle
mass,  and  reduction  of  serum  low-den-
sity lipoprotein cholesterol levels.252

Currently, DHEA is available in oral,
injectable, and topical forms. It is impor-
tant  to  understand  that  these  products
are  considered  nutritional  supplements
and  are  not  regulated  by  the  FDA.
Further  studies  should  be  performed  to
evaluate  the  safety  of  DHEA  and
DHEAS before recommending their use.

SIDE EFFECTS DHEA  is  a  relatively  new
product  in  the  “antiaging  armamentar-
ium”; therefore, little is known about the
effects  of  long-term  use.  Endogenous
DHEA concentrations peak at age 20 to
30  years.  Consequently,  the  use  of
DHEA in those younger than  35 years
may  be  risky.  In  fact,  there  has  been  a
reported case of DHEA being suspected
as  a  contributing  factor  in  a  manic
episode  of  a  young  man.253 The  effects
of  long-term  use  of  DHEA  have  not
been studied.

 
 
 
Melatonin

Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the
pineal  gland.  Less  than  10  years  ago,  it
was discovered to be a direct free radical
scavenger.  Besides  its  ability  to  directly
neutralize a number of free radicals and
reactive  oxygen  and  nitrogen  species,  it
stimulates several antioxidative enzymes
including  superoxide  dismutase,  GPX,
and glutathione reductase. This increases
its  efficiency  as  an  antioxidant.254
Melatonin has been shown to markedly
lipids  and
protect  both  membrane 
nuclear DNA from oxidative damage,255
and has been shown to reduce skin can-
cer  formation  in  mice.256 This  may  be
because of its protective UV absorption
effects.257 Further,  various  studies  in
humans have demonstrated that topical
melatonin  reduces  UV-induced  ery-
thema (sunburn).258,259 However, contro-
versial  results  have  been  obtained  in
another  study.260 With  regard  to  photo-
protection,  melatonin  was  shown  to
modulate  the  expression  of  apoptosis-
related  genes  in  UVB-irradiated  HaCaT
cells, resulting in increasing cell survival.
This  suggests  that  melatonin  may  be
used as a sunscreen substance to reduce
cell  death  of  keratinocytes  after  exces-
sive UVB irradiation.261

Melatonin  is  also  used  as  a  medica-
tion for sleep disturbance in depression
and in people complaining of jet lag. It is
currently  available  in  an  oral  form  and
has also been added as an ingredient to
various  topical  products,  such  as  facial
cleansers and moisturizers, eye creams,
and skin lighteners.

Selenium

Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element
found  in  Brazil  nuts,  walnuts,  shellfish,
fish,  and  North  American  wheat.  It  is  a
frequent  additive  in  antidandruff  sham-
poos because it is able to inhibit prolifera-
tion  of  the  yeast  Pityrosporum  ovale. The
current  RDA  of  selenium  is  55  (cid:14)g/d for
both men and women. Selenium behaves
both  as  an  antioxidant  and  anti-inflam-
matory  agent.  It  is  a  component  of  the
GPX  family  of  enzymes,  which  break
down  peroxides.  Therefore,  it  is  able  to
decrease  the  amount  of  free  radicals  by
reducing  H2O2 and  lipid  and  phospho-
lipid  hydroperoxides.  Selenium  can  also
reduce  hydroperoxide  intermediates  in
the  cyclooxygenase  and  lipoxygenase
pathways, thus resulting in a decrease in
inflammation.262 In addition, many stud-
ies have suggested that selenium confers
an  anticancer  effect.  Low  levels  of  sele-
nium  have  been  associated  with  an
increased  incidence  of  cancer  in  several

studies.263 Selenium supplementation has
been  shown  to  prevent  UVB-induced
skin tumors in hairless mice.264,265

In  addition  to  its  antioxidant  proper-
ties,  the  protective  effects  of  selenium
against skin cancer are enhanced because
it  prevents  the  production  of  inflamma-
tory  and  immunosuppressive  cytokines,
which impair immune responses follow-
ing  UV  exposure.  In  fact,  selenium  has
been shown to inhibit the UVB-induction
of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-(cid:7) in a dose-
dependent manner.266 Selenium has also
been  shown  to  boost  both  cellular  and
humoral  immunity.267 All  these  actions
work synergistically to give selenium its
anticancer  properties.  The  anticancer
activity  was  recently  demonstrated  in  a
large  double-blind,  placebo-controlled
intervention trial that evaluated whether
selenium  supplementation  could  reduce
the  risk  of  cancer.268 In  this  study,  1312
individuals  with  a  history  of  non-
melanoma skin cancer were randomized
to  placebo  or  200  (cid:14)g  selenium  per  day.
Although there was no effect on the pri-
mary  endpoint  of  nonmelanoma  skin
cancer, those receiving selenium showed
secondary endpoint effects of 50% lower
total  cancer  mortality  and  37%  lower
total  cancer  incidence  with  63%  fewer
cancers of the prostate, 58% fewer can-
cers of the colon, and 46% fewer cancers
of the lung.

SIDE EFFECTS The Institute of Medicine
has set a tolerable upper intake level for
selenium at 400 (cid:14)g/d.269 Selenium toxi-
city,  or  “selenosis,”  is  associated  with
gastrointestinal  upset,  hair  loss,  white
blotchy  nails,  and  mild  nerve  dam-
age.270 Selenium and other antioxidants
should always be taken as part of a bal-
anced  diet.271 Otherwise,  selenium  can
act  as  a  pro-oxidant  and  cause  DNA
damage.272

SUMMARY Although there is much inter-
est and enthusiasm regarding the use of
antioxidants, there is a paucity of clinical
trials  examining  the  capacity  of  antioxi-
dants  to  prevent  or  decelerate  the  aging
of  skin.  One  should  remember  that  the
theory behind the efficacy of these prod-
ucts is that they function by neutralizing
free  radicals,  thus  sparing  the  organs
from  the  damage  caused  by  these  reac-
tive oxygen species. There is no reason to
believe  that  antioxidants  treat  already
formed wrinkles unless it can occur by a
different  mechanism  such  as  through
increased collagen synthesis as seen with
vitamin C. Current research suggests that
combinations  of  various  antioxidants
might  have  synergistic  effects  and  conse-

quently more efficacy, as each antioxidant
is  endowed  with  various  properties  that
distinguish it from other antioxidants.16,273
Also,  some  data  suggest  a  cumulative  or
additive  beneﬁt  derived  from  using  oral
and topical antioxidant products in combi-
nation.274,275 This has resulted in the entry
of  many  antioxidant-containing  bever-
ages  onto  the  market.  It  is  unknown  if
these  beverages  help  prevent  aging  and
inflammation;  however,  they  are  harm-
less and may be beneficial. Further long-
term  studies  in  humans  are  needed  to
determine the efficacy of both the topical
and oral products.

DEFINING INFLAMMATION

Inflammation,  from  the  Latin  word
inflammatio  (to  set  on  fire), is  a  dynamic
vascular  and  cellular  reflexive  response
of the living tissue to injury; such injury
may  present  in  the  form  of  infection,
chemical damage (e.g., toxins, irritants),
physical damage (e.g., heat, cold, radia-
tion, mechanical trauma), and the bind-
ing of antibodies to antigens within the
body.1 Inflammation is therefore a pro-
tective  mechanism  of  the  organism
intended to remove such injurious stim-
uli  as  well  as  to  initiate  the  healing
process of the damaged tissue.

Localized vasodilation, increased vas-
cular permeability, extravasation of plas-
matic proteins, and migration of leuko-
cytes  into  the  affected  tissue  produce
what  Cornelius  Celsius  defined  in  the
first  century  as  the  “cardinal  signs”  of
acute  inflammation:  calor (heat),  dolor
tumor
(pain), 
(swelling).2 Functio  laesa  (loss  of  func-
tion) was later added to the definition of
inflammation by Rudolf Virchow in the
19th century.3

(redness),  and 

rubor

A basic sequence of events character-
izes  virtually  all  types  of  inflammatory
responses  regardless  of  the  provocative
stimuli.4 The initial reaction is vasodila-
tion followed by transient vasoconstric-
tion.  The  microvascular  endothelium
then  becomes  more  permeable  to
plasma proteins, which leak out into the
extravascular  compartment  thus  estab-
inflammatory  exudate.
lishing  an 
Inflammatory mediators released in the
area  induce  the  expression  of  selectin-
type  adhesion  molecules  on 
the
endothelial  cells.  Recruited  leukocytes
then interact with such adhesion mole-
cules, bind to the inflamed endothelium,
and  extravasate  into  the  tissue  where
they  respond  to  the  insult  through
phagocytosis and degranulation. Finally,
the  inflammatory  response  must  be
actively  terminated  when  no  longer
essential to prevent unnecessary damage
to tissue.

The  process  of  inflammation,  both
vascular and cellular, is orchestrated by a

large  array  of  inflammatory  mediators,
which  will  be  reviewed  below.  These
mediators include the following: (1) cel-
lular-derived  products,  such  as  vasoac-
tive amines (e.g., histamine), cytokines,
eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandins, throm-
boxanes,  and  leukotrienes),  enzymes,
and  oxygen  radicals  and  (2)  plasma-
derived  mediators,  which  include  com-
plement  cascade  components,  kinins,
and fibrinopeptides.

CELL-DERIVED INFLAMMATORY 
MEDIATORS AND THEIR ROLES 
IN THE INFLAMMATORY
PROCESS
Role of Eicosanoids

In  reaction  to  inflammatory  stimuli,
molecular  signaling,  or  cell  destruction,
phospholipids  contained  in  the  cellular
membrane are hydrolyzed by phospho-
lipase  A2  (PLA2)  thus  releasing  free
arachidonic acid (AA). This fatty acid is
the  primary  precursor  of  eicosanoids
(Fig.  35-1)—important  inflammatory
mediators  that  include  prostaglandins
(PGs),  thromboxanes  (TXs),  and  leuko-
trienes  (LTs)  among  others5 (Fig.  35-2).
Eicosanoids  are  not  stored.  Once
formed,  they  act  locally  at  the  site  of
synthesis  to  regulate  autocrine  and
paracrine functions.6 Different cell types
have  particular  sets  of  enzymes  for
eicosanoid  synthesis,  which  determine
their eicosanoid profile. Similarly, differ-
ent stimuli also influence the eicosanoid
profile produced by the cell.6 There are
two different pathways in the synthesis
of eicosanoids from AA:

(1) Cyclooxygenase  pathway:  All  eicosa-
noids with ring structures, that is, the
PGs, TXs, and prostacyclins, are syn-
thesized  via  the  cyclooxygenase
pathway. Two cyclooxygenases have
been identified: COX-1 and COX-2.
The former is ubiquitous and consti-
tutive,  whereas  the  latter  is  induced
in response to inflammatory stimuli.
The  products  of  these  and  subse-
quent  reactions  in  this  pathway  are
summarized in Fig. 35-2.

(2) Lipoxygenase pathway: Several lipoxy-
genase  enzymes  can  act  on  AA  to
form  different  peroxidated  deriva-
tives 
(the  hydroperoxyeicosate-
traenoic  [HPETE]  acids  5-HPETE, 
12-HPETE,  and  15-HPETE)  depend-
ing  on  which  carbon  of  AA  they
insert  or  attach  oxygen.  HPETEs  are
then rapidly reduced to hydroxylated
derivatives (HETEs), LTs, or lipoxins,
depending on the tissue.

Role of Cytokines

Cytokines  are  intracellular  signaling
polypeptides produced by activated cells.
Most  cytokines  have  multiple  sources,
targets,  and  functions7 (see  Chapter  4).
The  main  cytokines  that  are  produced
during, and participate in, inflammatory
processes8–10 are given in Table 35-1. These
inflammatory-associated  cytokines are
produced by various cell types, but the
most important sources are macrophages
and  monocytes  at  inflammatory  areas.7
Chemokines  (chemotactic  cytokines)
are small proteins that direct the move-
ment  of  circulating  leukocytes  toward
inflamed regions11—an essential step for

the host response to injury. Although a
large  number  of  cytokines  are  found
within  sites  of  inflammation,  two  of
these  cytokines,  namely,  interleukin-1
(IL-1)  and  tumor  necrosis  factor-(cid:7)
(TNF-(cid:7)), play a key role in orchestrating
the mechanisms responsible for inflam-
mation. These two cytokines induce the
production of lipid mediators, proteases,
and  free  radicals,  all  of  which  play  a
direct  role  in  the  development  of  the
deleterious  effects  of  inflammation.8 In
fact,  certain  cytokines,  including  inter-
feron-(cid:6) (INF-(cid:6)) and granulocyte colony-
stimulating  factor  (G-CSF),  amplify  the
inflammatory  response  by  increasing
the  production  of  IL-1  and  TNF-(cid:7) by
macrophages.8

Role of Mast Cells

Mast  cells,  derived  from  hematopoietic
precursors,  are  found  predominantly  near
blood  vessels,  nerves,  and  subepithelial
sites, where local immediate hypersensitiv-
ity reactions tend to occur.12,13 These cells
can  be  activated  during  acute  reactions
such  as  allergies  through  their  high-
affinity  receptors  for  the  Fc  portion  of
immunoglobulin  E  (IgE)  and  by  several

other  stimuli  including  complement  com-
ponents C3a and C5a, which will be briefly
explained later in this chapter. Other mast
cell stimulators that promote the release of
histamine  include  physical  stimuli  (e.g.,
heat,  cold,  and  sunlight),  macrophage-
derived  cytokines,  bacterial  toxins,  ven-
oms, trauma, and the presence of allergens.
Mast  cells  are  also  present  in  chronic
inflammatory reactions, and may produce
cytokines that contribute to fibrosis.14,15

When a mast cell armed with IgE anti-
bodies is reexposed to the specific aller-
gen, a series of reactions takes place, lead-
ing  eventually  to  the  release  of  various
potent mediators responsible for the clin-
ical  expression  of  immediate  inflamma-
tory-hypersensitivity  reactions.  In  the
first step of this sequence, antigens bind
to the IgE antibodies previously attached
to  the  mast  cells.  The  bridging  of  IgE
molecules  with  the  underlying  IgE-Fc
receptors  activates  signal  transduction
pathways  that  will  translate  into  three
outcomes16:  (1)  degranulation,  with  the
secretion  of  preformed  mediators-like
vasoactive amines (e.g., histamine), neu-
tral  proteases  (e.g.,  chymase,  tryptase,
hydrolase),  and  proteoglycans  (e.g.,
heparin, chondroitin sulfate); (2) de novo

synthesis of proinflammatory lipid medi-
ators (i.e., LTs C4, D4, and B4, and PG D2);
and finally (3) synthesis and secretion of
cytokines  (i.e.,  TNF-(cid:7),  IL-1,  IL-3,  IL-4, 
IL-5,  IL-6,  and  GM-CSF),  as  well  as
chemokines, such as macrophage inflam-
matory protein (MIP)-1(cid:3) and MIP-1(cid:3).13

Role of Histamine

Histamine  is  a  naturally-occurring  low-
molecular-weight amine synthesized by
the  decarboxylation  of  the  amino  acid 
L-histidine catalyzed by the enzyme his-
tidine  decarboxylase.  The  synthesis  of
this  important  vasoactive  amine  occurs
in  sites  where  the  former  enzyme  is
expressed,  such  as  basophils  and  mast
cells found throughout the body (includ-
ing lungs and skin), parietal cells of the
gastric-mucosa, and central nervous sys-
tem neurons.17,18

Histamine plays a fundamental role in
allergic  inflammation,18 which  charac-
terizes  certain  cutaneous  diseases  such
as allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and
immunologic  contact  urticaria  (ICU).
The  diverse  effects  of  histamine  over
human health depend upon four different
types  of  receptors;  however,  its specific

role  in  allergic  inflammation  mostly
occurs  through  the  H1-receptor.18,19
Through this receptor, histamine plays a
proinflammatory  role  by  inducing  the
release  of  cytokines  and  lysosomal
enzymes  from  macrophages  and  the
expression  of  cell  adhesion  mole-
cules.18,19 Additionally,  it  influences  the
activity  of  basophils,  eosinophils,  and
fibroblasts, causing smooth muscle con-
traction.20 Although most of the effects
of  histamine  in  inflammatory  allergic
disease  occur  through  the  H1-receptor,
cutaneous itch may occur through both
the H1- and H3-receptors.21

Role of Free Radicals

Oxygen-derived  free  radicals  may  be
released  extracellularly  from  leukocytes
after exposure to pathogens, chemokines,
and  immune  complexes,  or  following  a
phagocytic  challenge.22 The  physiologic
function  of  these  reactive  oxygen  inter-
mediates  is  to  destroy  phagocytized
production
microorganisms.  Their 
depends  on  the  activation  of  the  nicoti-

namide  adenine  dinucleotide  phosphate
(NADPH)  oxidative  system,  which  is  a
membrane-bound enzyme complex. This
system  can  be  found  in  the  plasmatic
membrane as well as in the membrane of
phagosomes  inside  the  cells.  Superoxide
(cid:5)
anion  (O2
),  hydrogen  peroxide  (H2O2),
and hydroxyl radical (OH) are the major
species  produced  within  the  cell;  these
metabolites  can  combine  with  nitric
oxide  (NO)  to  form  other  reactive  nitro-
gen  intermediates23 (see  Chapter  34).
Extracellular release of low levels of these
potent mediators can increase the expres-
sion  of  chemokines,  cytokines,  and
endothelial  leukocyte  adhesion  mole-
cules,  amplifying  the  cascade  that  elicits
the inflammatory response. At higher lev-
els,  the  release  of  these  mediators  can
induce  endothelial  cell  damage,  which
results in increased vascular permeability,
neutrophil  degranulation,  and  inactiva-
tion  of  antiproteases,  such  as  (cid:7)
1-anti-
trypsin,  leading  to  increased  destruction
of the extracellular matrix.24

Serum,  tissue  fluids,  and  host  cells  all
possess antioxidant mechanisms that pro-

tect against these potentially harmful oxy-
gen-derived radicals. These include among
others:  (1)  the  copper-containing  serum
protein  ceruloplasmin;  (2)  the  iron-free
fraction  of  serum,  transferrin;  (3)  the
enzyme  superoxide  dismutase,  which  is
found  or  can  be  activated  in  various  cell
types;  (4)  the  enzyme  catalase,  which
detoxifies H2O2; and (5) glutathione perox-
idase, another powerful H2O2 detoxifier.

The  influence  of  oxygen-derived  free
radicals in any given inflammatory reac-
tion  will  always  depend  on  the  balance
between the production and the inactiva-
tion  of  these  metabolites  by  both  cells
and tissues.

PLASMA-DERIVED MEDIATORS 
AND THEIR ROLE IN THE 
INFLAMMATORY PROCESS

necessary to mention the important role of
the complement components that are inte-
gral to the inflammatory process: C3a and
C5a. Both C3a and C5a are plasma-derived
mediators that stimulate histamine release
by  mast  cells,  thereby  inducing  vasodila-
tion.25 Additionally, C5a is able to act as a
chemoattractant, directing cells via chemo-
taxis to the site of inflammation.25

Role of Kinins

The kinin-kallikrein system is a network of
circulating  proteins  mainly  known  for  its
roles in inflammation, blood pressure con-
trol,  coagulation,  and  pain.  Furthermore,
several recent studies have concluded that
this system plays broader roles than those
classically  described,  for  example,  in
rosacea,  cancer,  cardiovascular,  renal,  and
central nervous system pathologies.26

The  system  consists  of  proteins,
polypeptides,  and  a  group  of  enzymes
that  activate  and  deactivate  the  com-
pounds.  Kinins  (bradykinin  [BK]  and
kallidin[KD])  are  polypeptides  produced
from kininogen and broken down by kin-
inases.  They  are  rapidly  generated  after
tissue injury and play a pivotal function in
the development and maintenance of the
inflammatory  process,  in  which  they
cause  dilation  of  blood  vessels  and
increased vascular permeability. They act
on PLA2 to increase AA release and thus
eicosanoid production27 (Fig. 35-1).

Kinins act by binding to two receptor
types, namely B1, and B2, which belong
to  the  G-protein  coupled  receptor  fam-
ily.  B2  receptors  are  constitutively
expressed in various cells under physio-
logic  conditions.  On  the  contrary,  B1
receptors  express  rapidly  under  mainly
pathologic  conditions.26 Kinins  (BK  and
KD)  have  a  higher  affinity  to  B2 recep-
tors, the activation of which leads to the
release  of  cytokines  and  other  inflam-
matory mediators (e.g., PG-E2).

Since  its  discovery,  BK  has  been
demonstrated to induce the four classical
signs  of  inflammation—heat,  redness,
swelling,  and  pain28—described  at  the
beginning  of  this  chapter.  BK  possesses
vasoactive  properties  that  enable  it  to
induce vasodilation and increase vascular
permeability.  Additionally,  it  causes
smooth  muscle  contraction,  induces
pain,  and  has  the  ability  to  activate
nuclear  factor-(cid:8)B  (NF-(cid:8)B),  further  con-
tributing to the inflammatory response.

Cutaneous Inﬂammation

The skin is the primary barrier between
our  bodies  and  the  environment  and
therefore  the  spectrum  of  insults  to

insults 

which  it  is  exposed  are  numerous  and
diverse.29 The translation of such insults,
which  include  different  pathogens  and
contact-sensitizing  antigens,  into  cuta-
neous inflammation requires a complex
interaction  among  multiple  inflamma-
tory  mediators.  Notably,  NF-(cid:8)B-medi-
ated  inflammation  appears  to  be  the
final  common  pathway  for  the  transla-
tion  of  environmental 
into
inflammation of the skin. NF-(cid:8)B, a pow-
erful  cellular  signaling  pathway,  can  be
activated by IL-1, TNF-(cid:7),30 and as men-
tioned  earlier,  BK.26 Interestingly,  the
epidermis is a “storehouse” of IL-1(cid:7) and
can  produce  considerable  amounts  of 
IL-1(cid:3) and  TNF-(cid:7).31,32 It  is  known  that
ultraviolet  (UV)  radiation  from  sunlight
induces  activation  of  IL-1  and  TNF-(cid:7),33
leading  to  NF-(cid:8)B-mediated  inflamma-
tion. NF-(cid:8)B regulates many genes in skin
cells; however, those that are essential to
the initiation of cutaneous inflammation
include  genes  for  E-selectin,  cytokines,
defensins  (antibacterial  peptides),  and
cell adhesion molecules.30

Of  special  importance  for  cutaneous
immunity  is  a  subgroup  of  memory 
T cells with the ability to circulate pref-
erentially  to  the  skin.  These  memory 
T cells are identified by a marker known
lymphocyte  antigen
as  cutaneous 
(CLA),34 and are generated in the lymph
nodes that drain the skin. Then, they are
specifically  recruited  back  to  the  skin
during  inflammation.  These  unique
skin-associated  lymphocytes  may  be
positive  for  either  CD4  or  CD8,  and
once activated, may be able to produce
either type 1 T-cell cytokines (i.e., INF-(cid:6),
IL-2, and lymphotoxin) or type 2 T-cell
cytokines  (i.e.,  IL-4,  IL-5,  IL-10  and 
IL-13).29 It is the activation of the T cells
and the subsequent release of cytokines
and other effector molecules that result
in  clinically  apparent  T-cell-mediated
inflammatory skin diseases.29

ously  wondered  if  their  specialty  had
come to its end.”37

Corticosteroids  are  known  to  sup-
press  proinflammatory  genes 
that
encode  cytokines,  cell  adhesion  mole-
cules, and other mediators that interfere
with the inflammatory response.38 They
selectively  induce  annexin  I,  an  anti-
inflammatory  protein  that  physically
interacts  with  and  inhibits  cytosolic
(cid:7)).39 By inhibit-
(cid:7) (cPLA2
phospholipase A2
ing this  phospholipase  they  block  the
release of AA and its subsequent conver-
sion  to  eicosanoids  such  as  PGs,  TXs,
prostacyclins, and LTs.40 A second anti-
inflammatory  protein  induced  by  corti-
costeroids  is  MAPK  phosphatase-1.
Bacteria,  viruses,  cytokines,  and,  inter-
estingly,  UV  radiation  are  all  examples
of inflammatory signals that activate the
MAPK  cascades.41 Finally,  glucocorti-
coids also induce and antagonize NF-(cid:8)B,
which  is  known  to  stimulate  the  tran-
scription of COX-2, an enzyme essential
for PG production.42

Since  some  of  the  anti-inflammatory
mechanisms  of  glucocorticoids  are  also
involved in physiologic signaling rather
than  inflammatory  signaling,  the  thera-
peutic  effects  of  these  drugs  in  inflam-
mation are often accompanied by clini-
cally significant side effects.40 Therefore,
although topical corticosteroids are gen-
erally  well  tolerated  for  short-term  use
on  inflammatory  skin  diseases,  long-
term  widespread  use  can  result  in  seri-
ous  cutaneous  adverse  effects  that
include:  skin  atrophy,  hirsutism,  folli-
culitis,  acne,  striae,  telangiectasia,  pur-
pura,  and  changes  in  pigmentation.43,44
Moreover,  even  more  serious  systemic
side  effects  such  as  hypothalamic  pitu-
itary  axis  (HPA)  suppression,45 hyper-
glycemia,46 avascular  osteonecrosis,47
glaucoma,48 and  posterior  subcapsular
cataracts49 have  also  been  reported  in
association  with  the  long-term  use  of
topical corticosteroids.

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS 
FOR THE TREATMENT OF 
INFLAMMATORY SKIN
DISEASES

Topical Corticosteroids

Not  so  long  ago,  dermatologic  therapy
was completely revolutionized with the
introduction  of  corticosteroids  in  the
early  1950s.  Spies  and  Stone,  two  der-
matologists  from  Alabama,  were  the
first  to  use  topical  hydrocortisone  to
successfully treat a patient with chronic
hand dermatitis.35,36 After this therapeu-
tic  success,  many  dermatologists  “seri-

Topical Immune Modulators

Topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus
and  pimecrolimus  have  been  investi-
gated  in  the  past  decade  as  treatment
options for inflammatory skin disorders.
These  relatively  new  immunosuppres-
sive  drugs  act  by  inhibiting  the  protein
calcineurin,  subsequently  preventing 
T cell dephosphorylation of transcription
factors. As a result of this inhibition, the
signal  transduction  pathways  in  such
cells  are  blocked,  and  inflammatory
cytokine production is suppressed.50
Between  December  2000 

and
December  2001,  topical  tacrolimus

ointment  and  topical  pimecrolimus
cream  received  approval  by  the  Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
atopic  dermatitis.51
treatment  of 
Furthermore,  topical  tacrolimus  has
been proven to inhibit other inflamma-
tory  skin  conditions  such  as  nickel-
induced  ACD52,53 as  measured  by  a
reduction in erythema, pruritus, vesicu-
lation, induration,53 and histopathologic
pattern.54 Its inhibitory action has even
been  found  by  some  researchers  to  be
stronger  than  the  steroid  aclometasone
dipropionate.55

Even  though  these  medicaments  are
structurally  very  similar,  pimecrolimus
has  a  higher  lipophilicity  index  than
tacrolimus  (20-fold  more  lipophilic).
Although  a  higher  lipophilicity  index
has been correlated with a higher affin-
ity for the skin,43 pimecrolimus is three-
fold  less  potent  an  inhibitor  of  cal-
cineurin than tacrolimus.56

In  February  2005,  just  a  few  years
after these drugs were approved by the
FDA,  the  pediatric  advisory  committee
of  the  Center  for  Drug  Evaluation  and
Research  of  the  FDA  required  that  the
labeling of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus
include  the  placement  of  a  “black  box”
warning about the potential cancer risks
associated  with  the  systemic  adminis-
tration of these medications.57 However,
although  there  is  a  theoretical  concern,
there has been no evidence to suggest an
increased  risk  of  cutaneous  or  visceral
cancer associated with the use of these
drugs in their topical form.58

Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors

An  increasing  number  of  anti-inflam-
matory agents specifically target bioac-
tive lipids generated from AA, namely,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs
(NSAIDs).  Although  this  group  of
medicaments is one of the most studied
and  used  throughout  medicine,  their
application  for  cutaneous  disease  is
somewhat  limited.59 Ibuprofen,  how-
ever, has been shown to be effective for
the  treatment  of  acne,  since  inflamma-
tory  acne  lesions  are  infiltrated  with
neutrophils  and  ibuprofen  is  known  to
inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis.60

More  than  two  decades  ago,  Wong 
et al. conducted a double-blind study of
60  male  and  female  patients  15  to 
35 years old with acne vulgaris.61 Patients
were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  four
groups:  (1)  oral  ibuprofen  (600  mg)  plus
tetracycline (250 mg) 4 times daily (qid);
(2) ibuprofen (600 mg) plus placebo qid;
(3) tetracycline (250 mg) plus placebo qid;
and (4) two placebos qid. Only the com-

bination  therapy  had an  effect  statisti-
cally  better  than  the  placebo  in  the
improvement of total lesion count. The
administration  of 
ibuprofen  alone
yielded beneficial results comparable to
the  ones  of  tetracycline  alone  but  with
fewer side effects.

As  a  follow-up  to  this  study,  1  year
later,  Funt  treated  22  male  and  female
patients aged 14 to 25 years with nodu-
locystic  acne  with  a  combination  of
minocycline (50 mg) plus oral ibuprofen
(400 mg) 3 times daily. After 1 month, all
patients  apparently  responded  to  the
combination  therapy  with    improve-
ment  ranging  from  75%  to  90%.
Notably, all 22 patients had a history of
unsuccessful  oral  antibiotic  treatment
(3-month course of minocycline, 50 mg
3 times daily).62

indomethacin) 

NSAIDs are also applied in dermatol-
ogy in the treatment of sunburn. Hughes
et al. studied the ability to modify skin
injury  induced  by  UVB  radiation  by
nonsteroidal  drugs  (i.e.,  oral  ibuprofen
or 
topical
betamethasone  dipropionate  in  24  sub-
jects.63 Skin responses to UVB (erythema
and  increased  skin  blood  flow  [SBF])
were  measured  serially  and  showed  a
synergistic  effect  of  oral  NSAIDs  in
topical  cortico-
combination  with 
steroids  in  the  reduction  of  UVB-
induced  skin  injury.  In  another  study,
ibuprofen  and  placebo  were  compared
in a randomized double-blind cross-over
study  of  19  psoriatic  patients  receiving
UVB  phototherapy.  Signs  and  symp-
toms  of  UVB-induced  inflammation
were then assessed. Although a statisti-
cal  difference  was  noted  for  only  one
variable (i.e., technician’s assessment of
erythema),  results  suggest  that  ibupro-
fen was more effective than placebo for
the symptomatic relief of UVB-induced
inflammation  after  high  doses  of  UVB-
phototherapy  for  psoriasis.  The  postu-
lated  biochemical  basis  for  this  result
derives  from  the  observation  that  der-
mal PGs are elevated after UVB irradia-
tion.64 Therefore,  an  NSAID  agent  that
interferes with PG synthesis may reduce
UVB-induced inflammation.

Salicylic Acid

Experimental  and  clinical  data  indicate
that  salicylates  exhibit  a  spectrum  of
activities that include anti-inflammatory
and  antimicrobial  actions.65 As  a  mem-
ber  of  the  aspirin  family,  salicylic  acid
achieves  its  analgesic  and  anti-inflam-
matory properties by truncating the AA
cascade. Salicylates are active in control-
ling  inflammation  by  altering  gene

expressions.  They  suppress  the  expres-
sion  of  proinflammatory  genes  by
inhibiting  the  DNA-binding  activities 
of  transcription  activators  such  as 
NF-(cid:8)B,  activation  protein-1  (AP-1)  and
CCAAT/enhancer-binding  protein  (cid:3)
(C/EBP(cid:3)).65

Salicylic  acid  is  known  to  decrease
the frequency and severity of acne erup-
tions  by 
reducing  acne-associated
inflammation  in  addition  to  imparting
an  exfoliating  action  over  the  pores.  It
has therefore become a popular ingredi-
ent  in  over-the-counter  acne  products
(see  Chapter  20).  Salicylic  acid  is  also
used to treat rosacea and other superfi-
cial inflammatory disorders. In addition,
it is found in products intended to treat
photoaged skin. Topical salicylic acid in
concentrations  of  up  to  30%  has  been
shown  to  fade  age-related  pigmented
spots,  decrease  surface  roughness,  and
reduce  fine  lines.66 If  used  in  high  con-
centrations  or  too  frequently,  salicylic
acid may lead to redness, pruritus, scal-
ing, increased skin sensitivity, and even
epidermolysis.

Sulfur/Sulfacetamide

The  medicinal  use  of  sulfur  dates  back
to  the  time  of  Hippocrates,  who  is
believed  to  have  mentioned  its  use  for
the treatment of plague.67 It is currently
found  in  many  products  including  the
spa  waters  and  elegant  products  from
the Vichy spa in France. Most of what is
known  about  sulfur  was  written
decades  ago,  with  moderate  to  little
interest evinced in the recent literature.
Nevertheless,  sulfur  continues  to  be
used  throughout  the  world  mainly  to
treat  acne, 
seborrheic  dermatitis,
rosacea,  scabies,  and  tinea  versicolor.68
Elemental  sulfur  (a  yellow,  nonmetallic
element)  and  its  various  forms  (e.g.,
sulfides,  sulfites,  and  mercaptans) 
are  believed  to  have  antimicrobial,
antifungal,  and  antiparasitic  properties.
Furthermore,  sulfur-containing  com-
pounds  have  proved  to  be  “excellent
anti-inflammatory  agents.”69 Interest-
ingly,  the  action  of  sulfur  in  the  skin
depends  on  its  direct  interaction  with
the  cutaneous  surface;  the  smaller  the
particle  size,  the  greater  the  area  avail-
able for sulfur—skin interaction and the
greater the efficacy.70 Two sulfur prepa-
rations are found as official formulations
in  the  United  States  Pharmacopoeia:
sublimed  sulfur  and  precipitated  sulfur.
Precipitated sulfur has a smaller particle
size and therefore is superior in efficacy
to  sublimed  sulfur;  in  fact,  this  is  the
type of sulfur most widely used.

 
 
 
Sulfur  was  once  the  most  common
active  ingredient  found  in  antiacne  for-
mulations,60 but  has  widely  come  into
disuse  mainly  because  of  its  malodor-
ousness,  resembling  rotten  eggs.  The
therapeutic  effect  of  sulfur  in  acne  and
seborrheic dermatitis is thought to result
from its keratolytic action.71 The precise
mechanism  for  this  effect  is  unknown
but probably depends on its interaction
with  the  cysteine  content  of  ker-
atinocytes,  allowing  the  formation  of
hydrogen  sulfide,  which  in  turn  breaks
down keratin.70 In the treatment of acne
and seborrheic dermatitis, sulfur is often
combined  with  agents  such  as  salicylic
acid,  the  keratolytic  action  of  which
may be synergistic with that of sulfur.72
Sulfur  is  commonly  combined  with
sodium  sulfacetamide,  a  sulfonamide
agent  with  antibacterial  activity.  It  acts
as  a  competitive  antagonist  to  para-
aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential
component  for  bacterial  growth.73 In
fact,  sodium  sulfacetamide  has  been
demonstrated  to  be  active  against
Propionibacterium  acnes.74 When  mixed
with  sulfur  in  dermatologic  prepara-
tions, the combined keratolytic and anti-
inflammatory  effect  of  sulfur  with  the
antibacterial  effect  of  sulfacetamide
results  in  an  effective  topical  formula-
tion  for  the  treatment  of  acne  vulgaris,
rosacea,  and  seborrheic  dermatitis.75
This  combination  is  available  as  a
cream,  lotion,  gel  topical  suspension,
cleanser, and silica-based mask.

Botanicals and Other Natural
Ingredients

Natural  ingredients  have  been  used  in
traditional  medicine  throughout  the
world for thousands of years; however,
it is in the last 15 years that botanically
derived  products  have  gained  wide-
spread usage and interest among the US
population.76 As a result, botanical prod-
ucts  have  become  highly  marketable.
This  increased  popularity  has  occurred
for  several  reasons:  (1)  concerns  about
the adverse effects of chemical drugs; (2)
questioning  of  the  approaches  and
assumptions  of  allopathic  medicine;  (3)
greater public access to health informa-
tion;  and  (4)  the  growing  popularity  of
organic products. All this translates into
a very broad array of botanical products
now  being  used  in  different  medical
specialties 
including  dermatology.
Fortunately, we are now able to employ
scientific methods to prove or question
their  efficacy  and  better  understand
their mechanisms of action. The follow-
ing  discussion  focuses  on  some  of  the

most  important  botanicals  that  confer
anti-inflammatory  properties.  Of  note,
when  looking  for  botanicals  as  compo-
nents of personal care products and cos-
metics,  it  is  important  to  consider  the
names  given  by  the 
International
Nomenclature for Cosmetic Ingredients
(INCI),  used  for  ingredient  disclosures
inside a product’s list of ingredients.

Aloe Vera

Aloe vera is one of the most widely used
herbal products in the world. It is native
to  northern  Africa  and  the  Arabian
Peninsula,  but  through    trade  its  use
extended to most of the ancient civiliza-
tions  (Egypt,  Persia,  Greece,  Rome,
India, and China) where it was used for
the treatment of burns and wounds. The
Spanish later brought it to America and
parts  of 
including
the  Caribbean 
Barbados  (from  which  the  alternate
INCI name Aloe barbadensis is derived).77
There is a large body of anecdotal evi-
dence attesting to the efficacy of aloe for
the treatment of myriad diseases; unfor-
tunately,  exaggerated  claims  are  not
uncommon and therefore caution is war-
ranted  in  the  interpretation  of  some  of
the available information.78 Explanations
of aloe gel efficacy are still varied because
it  has  in  fact  several  active  constituents
operating through different mechanisms.79
Its action as a moisturizer, for example, is
a popular use that may account for much
of  its  effects.80 Furthermore,  aloe  is
reputed to exhibit potent anti-inflamma-
tory effects, and the substances that have
been  proposed  as  its  active  anti-inflam-
matory  constituents  include  salicylates
(providing “aspirin-like effects”); magne-
sium lactate, which is believed to inhibit
the production of histamine; BK and TX
inhibitors, which provide pain reduction;
and  polysaccharides,  particularly  ace-
mannan,  which  has  reported  immuno-
modulatory properties.81,82 Another sub-
stance  isolated  from  aloe,  C-glucosyl
chromone,  has  exhibited  topical  anti-
inflammatory activity equivalent to that
of hydrocortisone (200 (cid:14)g/ mouse ear).83
A  recent  study  by  Habeeb  et  al.84
explored reports of antimicrobial effects
associated with aloe.85 Using a simple in
vitro  assay,  they  determined  the  effect
of  the  inner  gel  of  aloe  on  bacterial-
induced proinflammatory cytokine pro-
duction (namely, TNF-(cid:7) and IL-1(cid:3)) from
human 
leukocytes  stimulated  with
Shigella  flexneri.  Results  demonstrated
the suppression of both bacterial-induced
cytokines  with  the  use  of  aloe  inner
gel.84 Further studies are still needed for
a  deeper  and  more  precise  understand-

ing of aloe constituents and their varied
biologic activities.

Chamomile

to 

the  Asteraceae 

Chamomile  is  a  sweet-scented  flower
belonging 
(or
Compositae) family that has been used
as a medicinal herb worldwide for hun-
dreds  of  years,86 and  is  still  one  of  the
most  widely  used  medicinal  herbs.  It
has  been  recognized  for  its  therapeutic
properties  since  the  age  of  Hippocrates
(circa 500  BCE). The ancient Greeks and
Egyptians used it to treat erythema and
dry skin.87

There  are  two  primary  types  of
chamomile,  Roman  chamomile  (INCI
name: Chamaemelum nobile) and German
chamomile  (INCI  name:  Matricaria  recu-
tita or Chamomilla recutita). Although both
plants  have  been  used  for  therapeutic
applications,  the  flowers  of  German
chamomile  contain  a  higher  concentra-
tion  of  key  active  ingredients  that  have
shown 
activity 
anti-inflammatory 
in  vivo88:  the  terpenoids  chamazulene
and (cid:7)-bisabolol. Because of this fact, the
official medicinal chamomile is German
chamomile. In an animal study in which
inflammation was induced via the injec-
tion of carrageenan and PG E1, German
chamomile was found to suppress both
the  inflammatory  effect  and  leukocyte
infiltration.89 Specifically,  chamazulene
decreases  the  inflammatory  process  by
inhibiting  LT  synthesis.88 It  is  believed
that  chamomile  also  confers  significant
beneficial effects to the skin, such as the
improvement  of  texture  and  elasticity,
ameliorating the signs of photodamage.
In  addition  to  reports  of  anti-
inflammatory effects, chamomile is said
to  possess  some  antioxidant  proper-
ties,90 which are mainly associated with
other  active  ingredients,  namely  the
terpenoid  matricine  and  the  flavonoids
apigenin and luteolin, all of which have
documented  antioxidant  properties.91
As a result of its various beneficial pro-
perties,  chamomile  is  now  included  in
several cosmetic products intended to im-
prove skin appearance. Of note, chamo-
mile has been reported to cause ACD in
susceptible  types.92 Those  with  known
allergies to the compositae plant family
(e.g., ragweed) are at the greatest risk.

Cucumber Extract

Cucumber (INCI name: Cucumis sativus)
has a long history of use in ancient and
folk  medicine.  Reputedly  used  by
Cleopatra to preserve her skin,93 cucum-
ber  extract  has  found  regular  usage  in

modern  skin  care,  with  most  of  its
healthy  characteristics  observed  when
used topically.

Cucumber  extract  is  known  for  its
emollient  and  soothing  properties,
specifically. It contains high amounts of
amino  acids  and  organic  acids  that  are
beneficial  to  the  skin’s  acid  mantle.  In
addition,  shikimate  dehydrogenase,  an
enzyme extracted from cucumber pulp,
has  demonstrated  anti-inflammatory
properties  when  applied  to  the  skin.93
More  scientific  studies  are  needed,
though,  to  confirm  and  further  expand
the limited known cutaneous effects of
treatment with cucumber extract.

Feverfew

Feverfew  (FF)  (INCI  name:  Tanacetum
parthenium)  is  a  rapidly  growing  small
bush  with  citrus-scented  leaves  and
daisy-like flowers (Fig. 35-3). It belongs
to  the  Asteraceae  (or  Compositae)
family, characterized by the star-shaped
flower  head  of  its  members.  Since  the
first century, FF has been used to reduce
fever and pain. The use of this herb as
an antipyretic  led  to  the  appellation

“feverfew”—a  corruption  of  the  Latin
word  febrifugia (fever  reducer).94,95 FF
acts as a PG antagonist,96 and one of its
extracts, parthenolide, has been reported
to  inhibit  platelet  aggregation.  Addi-
tionally, it  has  been  shown  to  bind  to
and  inhibit  I(cid:8)B  kinase  (cid:3) (IKK-(cid:3)),  the
kinase  subunit  known  to  play  a  critical
role in cytokine-mediated stimulation of
genes involved in inflammation,97 which
may  partly  explain  the  anti-inflamma-
tory  properties  attributed  to  this  herb.
Parthenolide  is  a  type  of  sesquiterpene
lactone, an essential oil commonly found
in  members  of  the  Asteraceae  family.
Sesquiterpene  lactones  are  known  for
their  anti-inflammatory  effects; never-
theless,  they  also  exert  the  major  aller-
genic effects of this plant family. In fact,
FF-derived  parthenolide  forms  part  of
the  Compositae  Mix  (CM)—a  solution
of  extracts  from  five  plant  species  that
can be applied as a patch test to screen
for  Asteraceae  allergy.98 The  Aveeno
Ultra Calming line of skin care products
contains  FF  but  with  the  parthenolide
portion removed, thus yielding the anti-
inflammatory  properties  of  FF  without
posing  the  risk  of  contact  dermatitis.

The  beneficial  effects  of  this  partheno-
lide-depleted extract of FF were demon-
strated  in  a  recent  study.99
In  this
research, in vitro FF was shown to atten-
uate  the  formation  of  UV-induced
hydrogen  peroxide  and  to  reduce
proinflammatory  cytokine  release;  in
vivo,  topical  FF  reduced  UV-induced
epidermal  hyperplasia,  DNA  damage,
and apotosis.99

Ginseng

Several  types  of  ginseng  are  found
throughout the world, and all are part
of  the  Araliaceae  family  in  the  genus
Panax (Fig.  35-4).  The  word  Panax
means  “all  healing,”  which  describes
the  traditional  belief  that  ginseng
manifests  properties  that  heal  all 
the  diseased  aspects  of  the  body. 
There  are  several  different  species  of
ginseng;  two  of  the  most  commonly
used  are  P.  ginseng (Chinese  ginseng),
popular  among  Asian  cultures,  and 
P.  quinquefolius (American  ginseng),
commonly  used 
among  Native
Americans.100

chemopreventive 

Studies  indicate  that  ginseng  may
exert 
properties
against cancer. Mechanisms behind this
assumption  include  inhibition  of  DNA
damage,101 induction  of  apoptosis,102
and  inhibition  of  cell  proliferation.103
There is also evidence that ginseng has
potent effects on the inflammatory cas-
cade  and  may  inhibit  the  “inflamma-
tion-to-cancer  sequence.”  For  example,
ginsan, a polysaccharide extracted from
P. ginseng, has been shown to inhibit the
release of proinflammatory cytokines in
vivo.104 Furthermore,  the  ginsenoside
Rg3  has  been  demonstrated  to  inhibit
the  NF-(cid:8)B-mediated  induction  of  the
inflammatory  process.105 In  addition,
BST204,  a  fermented  ginseng  extract,
can  inhibit  inducible  nitric  oxide  syn-
thase (NOS) expression and subsequent
nitric  oxide  production  in  animal  mod-
els. Finally, ginseng has been proven to
inhibit  the  production  of  TNF-(cid:7) and
other  proinflammatory  cytokines  by
cultured macrophages when exposed to
bacterial lipopolysaccharides.106

Licorice Extract

Licorice  (also  known  as  Liquiritae  offici-
nalis)  is  best  known  in  its  popular  con-
fectionery  form  of  black  or  red  candy.
Although it is not often thought of as a
plant, it is a botanical source of systemic

used  in  herbal  medicine  for  approxi-
mately 4000 years.107 There are different

different  chalcones,  researchers  found
that  four  of  the five  tested  chalcones,
including  licochalcone  A,  inhibited  the
production of proinflammatory cytokines
from  monocytes  and  T  cells.  The
investigators  concluded  that  licochal-
cone A and some of its synthetic ana-
logues  may  have  immunomodulatory
effects,  potentially  rendering  them
suitable  agents  for  the  treatment  of
infectious and other inflammatory dis-
eases.117 Chalcones  also  exhibit  activ-
ity  against  oxidative  stress.  A  study
assessing  their  radical  scavenging
activity  revealed  that  licochalcones  B
and D potently delay superoxide anion
production.118

The long history of traditional uses of
licorice root and the track record of pos-
itive  research  in  the  past  few  decades
make  licorice  one  of  the  most  widely
researched  plants  for  medicinal  pur-
poses.  The  evidence  supporting  the
medical  use  of  G.  inflata is  slightly  less
extensive than that of the related species
G. glabra, but it is similar in terms of the
broad range of potential applications.

Mushrooms

Several mushroom species are believed
to  offer  significant  potential  active
ingredients  in  health-promoting  phar-
maceutical  agents,  since  these  have
been  used  in  traditional  or  folk  medi-
cine for thousands of years.119 In partic-
ular,  extracts  from  medicinal  mush-
rooms  such as  Ganoderma 
lucidum
(lingzhi  in  Chinese,  reishi  or  mannen-
take  in  Japanese),  Lentinus  edodes (shi-
frondosa
Japanese),  Grifola 
itake 
(maitake  in  Japanese),  and  Cordyceps
sinensis,  among  others,  have  been  used
in China,  Japan,  and  Korea  to  treat

corticosteroids  with  glycyrrhetic  acid
has  been  proven  to  be  effective,  how-
ever.  One  study  displayed  effective
potentiation  of  hydrocortisone  activity
in  skin  by  the  addition  of  2%  gly-
cyrrhetic  acid.113 In  a  series  of  animal
studies,  Russian  scientists  found  that
glyderinine,  a  derivative  of  glycyrrhizic
acid, exhibited anti-inflammatory, anal-
gesic,  as  well  as  antipyretic  properties,
and  concluded  that  glyderinine  is  an
appropriate ingredient for the treatment
of certain skin diseases.114

G. INFLATA The primary active ingredient
of  Chinese  licorice  root  is  licochalcone
A115—a  compound  that  has  exhibited
anti-inflammatory  activity  against  AA-
induced mouse ear edema.116 It is found
in  the  Eucerin  Redness  Relief  products.

(Fig. 35-5) and Glycyrrhiza inflata (Fig. 35-6)
are  the  ones  that  have  displayed  the
most therapeutic actions, including anti-
inflammatory  properties.  G.  inflata is
actually the Chinese licorice root, while
G. glabra grows around the Mediterranean
Sea,  the  Middle  East,  and  central  and
southern Russia.108

G. GLABRA Extracts  from  this  more
Western  species  of  licorice  are  an
increasingly common ingredient in anti-
inflammatory  products.109 Glycyrrhizin
is  its  primary  active  component,  but  it
also  contains  polysaccharides  and
various  polyphenols,  such  as 
the
isoflavone formononetin, which exhibits
antioxidant activity.110 Glycyrrhetic acid
(the  biologically  active  metabolite  of 
G.  glabra)  has  been  reported  to  have
anti-inflammatory  activity  in  subacute
and  chronic  dermatoses,  and  therefore
has been used to treat eczema, pruritus,
contact  dermatitis,  seborrheic  dermati-
tis,  and  psoriasis.111 In  a  double-blind
study,  Saeedi  et  al.  evaluated  the  effect
of  1%  and  2%  topical  licorice  extract
preparations  on  atopic  dermatitis  in  60
patients.  Results  indicated  that  the  2%
topical  gel  was  effective  in  reducing
erythema, edema, and pruritus, prompt-
ing  the  researchers  to  conclude  that
licorice  extract  might  be  effective  in
treating  atopic  dermatitis.111 Studies
have shown that glycyrrhetic acid is able
to  exert  a  cortisone-like  effect,  thus
inhibiting  proinflammatory  PGs  and
LTs.112 However,  licorice  (glycyrrhetic
acid)  has  not  been  demonstrated  to  be
superior  to  topical  corticosteroids  in
treating  acute  inflammation,  such  as
atopic dermatitis.111 The combination of

 
 
tive therapy in inflammatory and pruritic
skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis;
irritant  and  ACD  including  contact  to
poison ivy, oak and sumac; insect bites;
diaper  dermatitis;  cercarial  dermatitis;
xerosis;  ichthyosis;  urticaria;  and  sun-
burn.126,128,130,131 CO  also  prevents  and
repairs damage caused by environmental
insults such as UV radiation, smoke, bac-
teria, and free radicals.109

Published clinical studies of CO have
generally  yielded  positive  results  that
continue  to  support  the  therapeutic  use
of  oatmeal.  In  a  clinical  model  of  skin
irritation with sodium lauryl sulfate, two
different  types  of  CO  products  signifi-
cantly  reduced  the  amount  of  experi-
mentally  induced  irritation  and  inflam-
mation.132 In  a  different  clinical  study,
two  shower  gels  were  evaluated  for
relief of pruritus in burn patients.133 Both
gels  contained  liquid  paraffin  but  only
one  also  contained  5%  CO.  The  oat-
meal-containing  compound  was  associ-
ated with significantly greater reduction
in patient-reported pruritus and requests
for antihistamines. Furthermore, Boisnic
et al. developed a clinical model of cuta-
neous inflammation involving the effects
of an oatmeal extract on tissue fragments
exposed to vasoactive intestinal peptide,
a  proinflammatory  neuromediator.134
The  application  of  vasoactive  intestinal
peptide  increased  inflammation,  which
was  significantly  ameliorated  by  treat-
ment with the oatmeal extract.

In 

Specifically, 

The therapeutic and cosmetic uses of
oatmeal have been enhanced by the iso-
lation  and  identification  of  specific  oat
components. 
avenan-
thramides, a newly discovered group of
polypenolic  alkaloids,  have  been  found
exclusively  in  oats.  As  a  group,  pheno-
lics  display  a  broad  range  of  biologic
activities including prevention of inflam-
mation  and  oxidation.135
fact,
phenolics are the strongest antioxidants
found in nature,136 although within this
class  of  compounds,  individual  sub-
stances  exert  varying  levels  of  antioxi-
dant  activity.  Oat  phenolic  compounds
including  avenanthramides  have  been
identified  as  potent  antioxidants  that
scavenge  reactive  oxygen  and  nitrogen
species.135 Furthermore, they have been
reported  to  inhibit  PG  biosynthesis
nearly  as  well  as  the  synthetic  anti-
inflammatory  agent  indomethacin.137
Another  recent  study  provided  more
evidence  that  avenanthramides  evince
potent  anti-inflammatory  activity.138 In
this  research,  keratinocytes  were  incu-
bated  with  an  inducer  of  proinflamma-
tory  IL-8  in  the  presence  of  vehicle  or
inclusion  of
avenanthramides.  The

bronchitis, gastric ulcer, hepatitis, hyper-
glycemia,  hypertension,  inflammation,
insomnia,  nephritis,  neurasthenia,  scle-
roderma,  and  cancer.120 Furthermore,
these  various  species  have  been  used
in topical  dermatologic  formulations
designed for antiaging purposes.

G. LUCIDUM The  dried  powder  form  of
Lingzhi  has  been  used  since  ancient
times  in  China  to  treat  cancer,120 and
currently  it  continues  to  be  used  as  a
home  remedy  for  the  treatment  of
inflammation  and  wound  healing.121
Recent research using rats and mice has
revealed that the ethanol extract of the
mycelium of G. lucidum exhibits signifi-
cant  antiperoxidative,  anti-inflamma-
tory,  antimutagenic,122 and  antioxidant
properties.123 This species of mushroom
is  one  of  the  most  studied  botanical
treatments in Asia and it has become a
popular  ingredient  in  topical  skin  care
products in the West.

C. SINENSIS Mycelium extract of C. sinensis
has  been  demonstrated  to  exhibit  im-
munomodulating activity and the capac-
ity  to  decrease  bacterial  growth  and
dissemination,  resulting  in  improved
survival.124

Oatmeal

were  frequently  used  for  the  treatment
of  pruritic  inflammatory  skin  condi-
tions.  Somewhat  more  recently,  both
Dick and Sompayrac reported in the late
1950s that colloidal oatmeal (CO) baths
were demonstrably effective in the man-
agement  of  pediatric  atopic  dermati-
tis.126,127 As a component of the modern
dermatologic  armamentarium,  CO  has
replaced  rolled  oats  and  plain  oatmeal.
CO  is  composed  of  de-hulled  oats
ground to a fine powder that retains the
moisturizing  effects  of  the  whole  oat
grain and disperses more easily in bath
water.  It  can  also  be  added  to  creams
and lotions for use in topical products.

CO  consists  primarily  of  polysaccha-
rides  (60%–64%),  proteins  (10%–18%),
and lipids (3%–9%). The remaining con-
stituents include enzymes (such as super-
oxide  dismutase),  saponins,  vitamins,
flavonoids, and inhibitors of PG synthe-
sis. Oat lipids contribute to the viscosity
of CO and help decrease transepidermal
water  loss  (TEWL),  a  key  factor  in  skin
dryness.  In  addition,  oatmeal  proteins
exhibit  emulsification,  hydration,  and
antioxidant  activity.  CO  proteins  and
polysaccharides bind to skin and provide
a  protective  barrier  to  external  insults.
The  proteins  further  act  as  a  buffer
against strong acids and bases.128

The combination of components and
properties  of  CO  renders  it  suitable  for
various uses in the care of inflammatory
skin  conditions,  such  as  cleaning,  mois-
turizing, protecting (i.e., barrier preserva-
tion),  and  relieving  pruritus  in  inflamed
skin.  In  fact,  oatmeal  is  one  of  the  few
natural products recognized by the FDA
as  an  effective  skin  protectant.129 As  a
consequence,  CO  is  one  of  the  few
botanicals  subject  to  FDA  regulation.129
The  range  of  dermatologic  applications
for CO is extensive and includes adjunc-

The  skin  care  application  of  oats  (INCI
name:  Avena  sativa)  and  oat-derived
products dates back to 2000 BCE in Egypt
and  the  Arabian  Peninsula.  In  the  19th
and early 20th centuries, oatmeal baths

avenanthramides reduced the release of
the  proinflammatory  cytokine  IL-8  by
10%  to  25%.  Various  other  preclinical
and  preliminary  clinical  studies  have
demonstrated a wide range of potential
benefits  from  topical  compounds  that
contain  avenanthramides,  including:
reduction  of  histamine-induced  itch  in
humans;  inhibition  of  NF-(cid:8)B,  thus
inhibiting  the  activation  of  inflamma-
tory pathways in the skin; and the amel-
ioration of skin irritation and erythema
induced by exposure to UVB irradiation.

Selenium

Selenium  is  an  essential  trace  element
found  in  the  human  body,  and  it  is
thought  to  have  anticarcinogenic,  anti-
inflammatory, antioxidant, and therefore
antiaging properties. Water, soil, and plant
foods are the major sources of selenium in
most  countries.  It  is  also  found  in  meat,
fish, Brazil nuts, shellfish, dairy products,
cereals, and cereal products. Selenium is a
component  of  the  water  used  in  the  La
Roche-Posay  spa  in  France  that  was
founded to treat atopic dermatitis patients
and  psoriasis  patients.  Many  of  the  La
Roche-Posay products, including the ther-
mal spring water, contain selenium. The
anti-inflammatory  role  of  selenium  is
very well expressed in one of the reduc-
tive metabolic pathways in humans: sele-
nium  is  the  vital  antioxidant  required  to
form  glutathione  peroxidase,  one  of  our
important  natural  antioxidant
most 
defenses.  The  function  of  this  essential
antioxidant enzyme (discussed in section
“Role of Free Radicals”) is to protect cell
membranes from oxidative deterioration,
a role that it shares with vitamin E. In fact,
studies have concluded that vitamin E and
selenium  act  synergistically  to  deliver
such protection.139

Selenium also exerts anti-inflammatory
activity in preventing the production of
inflammatory  cytokines.  One  study
showed  that  after  damage  to  the  skin
inflammatory
from  UV  exposure, 
cytokines 
immune
the 
inhibited 
response, thus increasing the number of
damaged  skin  cells.140 These  inflam-
matory cytokines also lead to the forma-
tion of wrinkles and premature aging of
the skin. Selenium can decrease produc-
tion of these cytokines, thereby prevent-
ing  inflammation.  Finally,  selenium
enhances  both  humoral  and  cellular
immunity,  increasing  the  host  response
to infection.141

As a result of its antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory  properties,  selenium  has
been added to topical skin care products
as well as natural spring water vaporiz-

ers  for  the  skin.  The  current  recom-
mended daily allowance of oral selenium
is  55  (cid:14)g  for  both  men  and  women.
However,  cancer  researchers  are  cur-
rently considering daily doses as high as
400 (cid:14)g. It must be noted that selenium
toxicity,  or  selenosis,  is  possible.  High
doses  of  selenium  are  neurotoxic  and
can  cause  hair  loss,  nail  loss,  and  der-
matitis, as well as gastrointestinal upset.
Despite  advertising  claims,  most  avail-
able  topical  formulations  contain  very
low  concentrations  of  selenium,  which
are  not  well  absorbed  by  the  skin.
Formulated as selenium sulfide, selenium
does  not  penetrate  the  skin.  However,
cutaneous  selenium  absorption  can  be
achieved with L-selenomethionine. Recent
animal  and  human  studies  have  found
that  when  taken  orally  or  applied  topi-
cally in the form of L-selenomethionine,
selenium  demonstrated  protection
against  both  daily  and  excessive  UV
damage.  In  one  study  a  decade  ago,
treated  patients  experienced  decreased
skin  inflammation  and  pigmentation,
plus a delay in the onset and a decrease
in  the  incidence  of  skin  cancer.142 In  a
different study performed in the 1990s,
researchers  at 
the  University  of
Edinburgh,  Scotland,  UK,  concluded
that oral selenium resulted in significant
protective  effects  against  UV  radiation-
induced  damage  to  skin  cells.  The
researchers  did  not  examine  topical
selenium.141 Although  these  early  stud-
ies of the effects of both oral and topical
selenium  are  promising,  more  double-
blind,  placebo-controlled 
trials  are
needed  to  support  selenium  as  an
adjunct to the antiaging product market.

Turmeric/Curcumin 

Turmeric  (INCI  name:  Curcuma  longa)  is
best known as a spice used primarily in
Asian  cuisine,  particularly  in  curry  and
prepared mustard. It has a long history in
both  Chinese  and  Ayurvedic  (Indian)
medicine  as  an  anti-inflammatory
agent.143 Curcumin  (diferuloylmethane)
is the yellow pigment that corresponds to
the key biologically active component of
turmeric  and  has  been  proven  to  have
more  acute  anti-inflammatory  effects
when  compared  to  the  volatile  oil  frac-
tion of turmeric.144 When used orally, this
herb  inhibits  LT  formation  as  well  as
platelet  aggregation  and  stabilizes  neu-
trophilic  lysosomal  membranes,  thus
inhibiting  inflammation  at  the  cellular
level.145 A study by Srimal and Dhawan
more than 30 years ago showed that the
anti-inflammatory  activity  of  curcumin
may  be  superior  even  to  that  of

ibuprofen.146 Moreover, 
it  has  been
demonstrated to exhibit significant wound
healing,  anticarcinogenic  and  antioxidant
properties. Finally, curcumin produces dif-
ferent  effects  depending  on  the  dosing
level; at low dose it can be a PG inhibitor,
while  at  higher  levels  it  stimulates  the
adrenal glands to secrete cortisone.147

SUMMARY

Inflammation  is  a  multifactorial,  convo-
luted process that plays a vital defensive
role  in  protecting  living  tissues  from  an
expansive variety of potentially deleteri-
ous injuries. However, protracted inflam-
mation itself can pose danger to the very
tissues and host organism for which the
cascading  events  of  the  inflammatory
process were launched to protect. Indeed,
this is the case in sensitive skin disorders
in which inflammation plays a character-
istic  role,  as  discussed  in  Chapter  12.  In
addition, inflammation is thought to play
a role in skin aging. As such, anti-inflam-
matory agents have a crucial role to play
in medicine as a whole, and clearly in the
practice of dermatology. Various modali-
ties can help decrease cutaneous inflam-
mation including topical skin care formu-
lations,  water  used 
in  spas,  diet,
supplements, as well as prescription and
over-the-counter medications.

Fragrance

Edmund Weisberg, MS
Leslie Baumann, MD

Innovative  products  and  procedures
inundate  medicine  and  the  specialty  of
dermatology at a dizzying pace. At the
same  time,  the  billion-dollar  beauty
industry continues to expand, with few
if any signs of a decline. The global fra-
grance  and  flavor  market  represents  a
significant  and  lucrative  subdivision  of
the beauty market and is constantly test-
ing various fragrance ingredients to stay
ahead  of  encroaching  regulation  and
increased rates of sensitization. Indeed,
while contact allergy to fragrance is not
a  presentation  seen  in  the  dermatolo-
gist’s  office  as  frequently  as  acne,  for
example,  it  is  a  common  problem  seen
often throughout the world. This is not
surprising  since  fragrances  are  virtually
omnipresent in products that come into
contact  with  the  skin,  for  example,
soaps,  body  lotions  and  moisturizers,
shampoos,  deodorants,  shaving  prod-
ucts,  cosmetics,  perfumes,  sunscreens,
and  dental  products,  as  well  as  food
products, detergents, and even air fresh-
eners. Furthermore, as stated in Chapter
18, fragrances consistently place among
the  top  10  contact  dermatitis  allergens
and represent the second most common
allergen  family  associated  with  allergic
contact  dermatitis,  second  only  to
nickel,  as  well  as  the  most  often  cited
cause  of  such  reactions  to  cosmetic
products.  This  looms  as  an  especially
important  realization  given  the  general
rise in the incidence of contact allergy to
various fragrances and the fact that epi-
demiologic  and  human  allergen  sensiti-
zation studies have shown that individ-
uals  who  are  found  to  be  sensitive  to
one allergen through patch testing are at
significantly greater risk of having a sec-
ond  allergen  identified.1–3 Particularly,
given  the  greater  expertise  expected  of
cosmetic  dermatologists 
regarding
agents intended to beautify the skin, it is
incumbent upon such specialists to have
a strong working knowledge of the pri-
mary fragrances identified as provoking
allergic reactions. This chapter will focus
briefly  on  selected  problematic  fra-
grances, primarily on the worst offend-
ers found within the Fragrance Mix (FM)
I and FM II.

DEMOGRAPHICS AND 
SIGNIFICANCE

An  epidemiologic  survey  in  the  United
Kingdom  published  in  2004  reported
that 23% of women and 13.8% of men
displayed  adverse  reactions  to  a  per-
sonal care product (e.g., deodorants and
perfumes,  skin  care  products,  hair  care
products,  and  nail  cosmetics)  over  the
course  of  1  year.4 More  recently,  in  a
1999  to  2006  Brazilian  study  of  176
patients (154 women and 22 men) seen
in  a  private  office  who  complained  of
dermatoses  resulting  from  cosmetics,
45%  exhibited  dermatoses  linked  to
cosmetics and 14% had skin lesions that
were found to be caused by inappropri-
ate  use  of  cosmetics.5 In  addition,  sev-
eral  studies  have  demonstrated  that
approximately  10%  of  dermatologic
patients who are patch tested for 20 to
100 ingredients exhibit allergic sensitiv-
ity to at least one ingredient common in
cosmetic  products.4 Fragrances  and
preservatives  are  the  most  common
allergens  and  women  aged  20  to  60
years  represent  the  demographic  group
that  experiences  the  majority  of  these
reactions.6 Individuals  who  are  overex-
posed to skin care products and patients
with  an  impaired  stratum  corneum,  as
manifested by dry skin, reportedly have
increased  susceptibility 
to  allergic
reactions.7 Contact  allergy  caused  by
fragrances  is  typically  seen  as  axillary
dermatitis, dermatitis of the face (includ-
ing the eyelids) and neck, hand dermati-
tis,  and  eruptions  in  locations  where
perfume  may  be  dabbed  on  or  sprayed
such as the wrists and behind the ears.8
It  is  important  to  note  that  while  the
overall  risk  of  allergic  reaction  to  fra-
grances is low, the absolute numbers of
individuals affected by fragrance allergy
is significant, and estimated to be 1% of
the general population.8

FRAGRANCE MIX I

The FM I is composed of eight different
substances,  including  oak  moss,  isoeu-
genol,  eugenol,  cinnamic  aldehyde,
geraniol,  hydroxycitronellal,  cinnamic
alcohol, and (cid:7)-amyl cinnamic aldehyde.9
The FM I (Table 36-1), known simply as
the FM for several years, was introduced
in 1977 by Larsen and widely adopted.10
This  was  a  full  20  years  after  the  first
report of an allergic reaction to fragrance-
based chemicals in 1957.11

(cid:7)-Amyl cinnamic aldehyde

In  a  review  of  patch  test  data  of
25,545  patients  from  1980  to  1996,
Buckley et al. found that oak moss was
the  most  common  allergen  throughout
the  period.  Oak  moss  contains  the
potent  allergens  chloroatranol  and
atranol.12,13 Sensitivity to isoeugenol and
(cid:7)-amyl  cinnamic  aldehyde  increased
during the 16-year period under review;
sensitivity  to  eugenol  and  geraniol
remained  stable;  reaction  to  hydroxy-
citronellal  declined  slowly;  and  precipi-
tous  drop-offs  in  sensitivity  frequency
were associated with cinnamic aldehyde
and cinnamic alcohol. Consequently, the
authors  identified  the  latter  two  FM  I
ingredients as rare fragrance allergens at
this  juncture.14 Bruze  et  al.  have  subse-
quently shown, however, that cinnamic
aldehyde  in  the  concentration  range  of
0.01%  to  0.32%  when  applied  twice
daily  on  healthy  skin  induces  axillary
dermatitis within a few weeks.15

Significantly, a recent study of related
pairs  found  in  the  FM  (i.e.,  cinnamal/
cinnamic  alcohol  and 
isoeugenol/
eugenol) as assessed through records of
23,660  patients  patch  tested  to  the  FM
from 1984 to 1998, indicated that there
were  substantial  isolated  reactions  to
the individual fragrance chemicals, justi-
fying their continued usage as individual
constituents in FM I.16

In  a  study  intended  to  evaluate  the
changing  frequencies  of  sensitization  to
the  FM  as  well  as  single  compounds
Myroxylon  pereirae (balsam  of  Peru),  and
oil  of  turpentine,  investigators  analyzed
the  data  amassed  by  the  Information
Network of Departments of Dermatology
multicenter project that ran from 1996 to
2002.  They  found  significant  increases
between  1996  and  1998  in  the  propor-
tions of patients exhibiting sensitivity to
both  single  compounds  and  the  FM.
However,  a  significant  decline  was
observed after 1999 in sensitization to the
FM,  which  the  researchers  attributed  to
reduced exposure as a result of the use of

less  potent  allergens  in  fine  fragrances,
and  the  potential  lower  use  of  natural
ingredient-based  cosmetics.  Investigators
also found the relative share of sensitivity
to individual ingredients of the FM to be
increased 
for  compounds  such  as
isoeugenol  and  oak  moss  that  could  not
be ascribed to their use, which for the top
allergen  oak  moss  was  reported  to  be
0.4% as compared to the lower-potency
geraniol,  thought  to  be  represented  in
50%  of  the  product  market.9 In  fact,
researchers  noted  that  the  International
Fragrance  Association  (IFRA)  and  the
Research Institute for Fragrance Materials
(RIFM) had recommended the use of lower
concentrations of isoeugenol and oak moss
(Table 36-2). Such findings helped to illu-
minate  the  emerging  belief  that  some
ingredients  within  the  FM  were  much
more significant allergens than others and
that  reevaluation  might  be  warranted,
including omission from the FM of some
of  the  less  troublesome  components.  In
addition,  one  of  the  primary  complaints
regarding  the  FM  I  had  been  the  emer-
gence of false positives and false negatives,
and  the  detection  of  only  approximately
70% of the patients allergic to fragrances.8

FRAGRANCE MIX II

In  addition  to  the  perceived  imbalance
in potency of the FM I compounds and
the debate over whether certain chemi-
cals continue to merit inclusion, a report
in 1993 estimated that the FM I failed to
least  15%  of  perfume 
identify  at 
allergies.17 Five years later, Larsen found
that as much as 33% of fragrance sensi-
tivity may go undetected if it is tested in
isolation, as the only test compound.18,19
The  incomplete  detection  of  fra-
grance  allergens  through  the  use  of  the

FM I and the identification of additional
sensitizing  allergens  through  clinical
experience,  and  subsequent  reporting
and  confirmation  of  such  findings,
eventually  led  to  the  development  of
the  FM  II  (Table  36-3).  For  instance,  a
multicenter  trial  in  Europe  completed
in  2002  that  evaluated  14  frequently
used chemicals laid the groundwork as
it  identified  the  six  most  sensitizing
chemicals all of which were ultimately
included as the FM II.20,21 These chemi-
cals—hydroxyisohexyl  3-cyclohexene
carboxaldehyde (Lyral®), citral, farnesol,
citronellol,  (cid:7)-hexyl-cinnamic  aldehyde,
and coumarin—were evaluated in 1701
consecutive  patients  who  were  patch
tested in six European centers. In all six
centers, the team of investigators found
the numbers of patients who reacted to
the three different concentrations of FM
II,  which  would  have  gone  undetected
by FM I, to be significant enough to war-
rant  the  codification  of  this  new  FM.
Overall, FM II (14%) elicited a reaction
in 2.9% of patients; of these, 33% were
negative to FM I. In a more recent study
in  Germany  of  6968  patients,  7.7%
reacted  to  FM  I  and  4.6%  reacted  to 
FM II.

In  2008,  investigators  writing  on
behalf  of  the  European  Society  of
Contact  Dermatitis  (ESCD)  and  the
European 
Environmental  Contact
Dermatitis  Research  Group  (EECDRG),
after conducting a literature review, rec-
ommended  that  the  FM  II  at  a  concen-
tration  of  14%  w/w  (5.6  mg/cm2)  and
Lyral,  specifically,  at  5%  w/w  (2.0
mg/cm2)  be  included  in  the  European
baseline  patch  test  series.  (The  ESCD
has  delegated  the  major  responsibility
for the European patch test series to the
EECDRG.)  Lyral  is  the  most  common
sensitizer  among  the  FM  II  fragrances,
followed by farnesol.19

Lyral

The  synthetic  fragrance  hydroxyiso-
hexyl  3-cyclohexene  carboxaldehyde
(HICC, Lyral) is a common allergen that
also  happens  to  be  used  in  more  than

50%  of  marketed  deodorants.22 Frosch
et  al.  tested  Lyral  (5%  in  petrolatum)
along  with  the  FM  I  and  11  other  fra-
grances  on  consecutive  patients  in  six
European  dermatology  departments  in
1999. Lyral elicited a positive reaction in
2.7% 
(range
1.2%–17%)  and  ranked  next  to  11.3%
with  FM  allergy,  leading  the  investiga-
tors to call for testing of Lyral in patients
thought  to  be  suffering  from  contact
dermatitis.23 Geier  et  al.  reported  on  a
subsequent  test  of  Lyral  5%  in  petrola-
tum  in  3245  consecutive  patch  test
patients in 20 dermatology departments,
with 1.9% reacting to the fragrance. As
part  of  this  study,  Lyral  and  FM  I  were
tested in parallel in 3185 patients, with
9.4% reacting to FM and 1.9% to Lyral.
A  reaction  to  both  occurred  in  40
patients,  corresponding  to  13.3%  of
those reacting to FM and 67.8% of those
reacting  to  Lyral.  As  a  result  of  this
study,  the  German  Contact  Dermatitis
Research Group (DKG) opted to include
Lyral  as  part  of  its  standard  patch  test
series.24 In 2002, Frosch et al. supervised
the  evaluation  of  1855  patients  patch
tested in six European dermatology cen-
ters  to  determine  the  frequency  of
responses to 8% FM and 14 other often
used  fragrances.  The  six  chemicals  dis-
playing  the  greatest  reactivity  after  FM
were,  in  descending  order,  Lyral,  citral,
farnesol,  citronellol,  hexyl  cinnamic
aldehyde, and coumarin. As a precursor
to  the  codification  of  the  FM  II,  they
found  these  six  substances  worthy  of
using  in  patch  testing  of  contact  der-
matitis patients, with Lyral as the most
notable of these chemicals.21

In  a  recent  small  study,  researchers
demonstrated  that  Lyral  causes  allergic
contact  dermatitis  in  a  high  percentage
of sensitized individuals at usage concen-
trations  typically  found  in  deodorants.22
Previously, Lyral had been found to pro-
voke contact allergic reactions in 2% to
3%  of  eczema  patients  undergoing
patch  testing.  In  a  small  study  of  18
eczema patients and seven control sub-
jects,  Johansen  et  al.  examined  a  dose-
response  relationship  of  Lyral  contact
allergy.  A  serial  dilution  of  Lyral  in
ethanol 6% to 6 ppm was administered
to  the  volar  forearm  in  a  2-week,
repeated open application test. Upon no
reaction  to  this  dosage,  cases  were
tested for 2 additional weeks at a higher
dose.  Eleven  cases  reacted  to  the  low
dose,  five  to  the  high,  and  two  to  nei-
ther.  There  was  no  reaction  to  the
ethanol vehicle-control. Control subjects
failed to react to either Lyral concentra-
tion  or  the  ethanol  vehicle.  With  a 

 
 
 
statistically significant difference between
the  groups,  the  investigators  concluded
that  Lyral  was  causing  skin  sensitivity.
They  recommended  reductions  in  usage
concentrations to prevent allergic contact
dermatitis in response to this fragrance.25
In 2006, the North American Contact
Dermatitis Group (NACDG) conducted
a  multicenter  study  comparing  three
concentrations of Lyral (5%, 1.5%, and
0.5%  in  petrolatum)  to  the  NACDG
screening tray, which includes FM I, bal-
sam  of  Peru,  cinnamic  aldehyde,  ylang
ylang oil, jasmine absolute, and tea tree
oil. Data collected from 1603 patients at
six sites identified balsam of Peru (6.6%)
and FM I (5.9%) to be the most common
patch-test-positive  fragrance  allergens,
followed by cinnamic aldehyde (1.7%),
ylang ylang oil (0.6%), jasmine absolute
(0.4%), Lyral (0.4% for 5% Lyral, 0.3%
for  1.5%  Lyral,  and  0.2%  for  0.5%
Lyral), and tea tree oil (0.3%). The inves-
tigators  concluded  that  Lyral  is  an
uncommon  allergen  in  North  America,
and  that  the  5%  concentration  should
be  used  in  patch  tests  for  patients  sus-
pected of having a fragrance allergy.26

FM I/II AND THE 26 
FRAGRANCES REQUIRED 
TO BE LABELED IN EUROPE

The  creation  of  the  FM  II  was  quickly
followed by additional regulation of the
fragrance market in Europe. As of March
2005,  as  mandated  by  the  seventh
amendment of the European Union (EU)
Cosmetics Directive, all cosmetic prod-
ucts  are  required  to  indicate  on  their
labels the presence of 26 individual fra-
grances if present at (cid:10)10 ppm in leave-
on products and (cid:10)100 ppm in rinse-off
products  (Table  36-4).  Similar  regula-
tions  were  instituted  regarding  deter-
gents as of October 2005, with labeling
mandated  for  any  of  the  26  fragrances
present at (cid:10)100 ppm.27

During  the  four  6-month  periods
between January 2003 and January 2005,
Schnuch  et  al.  patch  tested  21,325  indi-
viduals for the 26 fragrances in addition
to  the  standard  series  of  fragrances.
Frequencies  of  sensitization  were  noted
as  follows:  tree  moss  (2.4%),  Lyral
(2.3%),  oak  moss  (2.0%),  hydroxy-
citronellal (1.3%), isoeugenol (1.1%), cin-
namic aldehyde (1.0%), farnesol (0.9%),
cinnamic  alcohol  (0.6%),  citral  (0.6%),
citronellol 
(0.4%),
eugenol  (0.4%),  coumarin  (0.4%),  lilial
(0.3%),  amyl-cinnamic  alcohol  (0.3%),
benzyl cinnamate (0.3%), benzyl alcohol
(0.3%),  linalool  (0.2%),  methylheptin

(0.5%),  geraniol

investigators  concluded  that  clearly  the
26 fragrances range in importance as risks
to eliciting contact sensitivity, with some
of great concern and others of no signifi-
cance at all.28)

More recently, Buckley evaluated the
exposure  patterns  to  fragrances  on  the
UK  product  market  by  surveying  300
products  including  the  words  “parfum”
or  “aroma”  for  any  of  the  26  listed  fra-
grances. The fragrances that were most
linalool
frequently 
(63%), 
(63%),  citronellol
(48%),  geraniol  (42%),  butyl  phenyl
methyl  propional  (Lilial™)  (42%),  and
hexyl cinnamal (42%). Besides geraniol,
all the other FM I ingredients were rep-
(27%),  hydroxy-
resented:  eugenol 
citronellal 
(9%),
isoeugenol 
(17%), 
cinnamic  alcohol  (8%),  amyl  cinnamal
(7%),  cinnamal  (6%),  and  oak  moss
absolute (4%). The FM II ingredients, in

addition  to  citronellol  and  hexyl  cinna-
mal, were also found in the product sur-
vey  in  significant  numbers:  coumarin
(30%), Lyral (29%), citral (25%), and far-
nesol  (8%).  Buckley  concluded  that
exposure levels to key allergens in FM I
and  II  continue  for  the  British  popula-
tion. Given the frequent use of the fra-
grances  linalool  and  limonene,  Buckley
also suggested that these two chemicals
be included in the test series for patients
suspected of fragrance allergy.27

During  the  same  year,  Rastogi  et  al.
conducted a survey of four primary fra-
grance allergens–-isoeugenol, Lyral, atra-
nol,  and  chloroatranol—included  in  22
popular  Danish  as  well  as  international
brands  purchased  on  the  Danish  retail
market.  Isoeugenol  was  identified  in
56% of the products, Lyral in 72%, atra-
nol  in  59%,  and  chloroatranol  in  36%.
While  isoeugenol  was  found  to  be
included  in  concentrations  below  the
recommended maximum level of 0.02%
in  each  case,  Lyral  concentration
attained a maximum of 0.2%, which is
10-fold  higher  than  the  EU  Scientific
Committee’s identification of the safest
maximum  tolerable  concentration.  The
concentration  levels  for  atranol  and
chloroatranol  were  similar  to  those 
found in 2003 and the frequency of use
of  the  latter  represented  a  significant
reduction.29

Noting  that  the  prestige  perfumes
intended  for  women  have  been  the
products  demonstrated  to  contain  the
highest  concentrations  of  allergens,
Rastogi  et  al.  evaluated  10  fine  fra-
grances,  five  introduced  between  1921
and  1990  and  five  launched  since  then
by  the  same  companies.  They  found
that  the  five  older  perfumes  included  a
mean of 5 allergens in the FM I, whereas
the  five  newer  products  contained  a
mean  of  2.8  of  the  FM  I  allergens.  In
addition, the mean concentrations of the
FM  allergens  in  the  old  perfumes  were
2.6  times  higher  than  the  mean  for  the
new  products.  The  investigators  con-
cluded that a concerted effort by the fra-
grance  industry  to  curtail  the  use  of
offending 
ingredients  or,  perhaps,
changes  in  fashion  may  have  con-
tributed to this decrease in the use of FM
I allergens in prestige perfumes.30

It  is  important  to  note  that  even  in
products touted as containing only nat-
ural  ingredients,  fragrance  substances
represented in the FM I and II, including
hydroxycitronellal,  coumarin,  cinnamic
alcohol, and (cid:7)-amyl cinnamic aldehyde,
have been identified. In a study of natural
products,  Rastogi  et  al.  noted  that  the
presence  of  hydroxycitronellal  and

(cid:7)-hexylcinnamic  aldehyde  showed  that

ucts marketed for its natural ingredients.31

SUMMARY

Fragrances  are  ubiquitous  chemical
constituents in a significant proportion
of  the  products  people  use  on  a  daily
basis. A substantial minority of individ-
uals develop allergic contact dermatitis
to at least one of the many hundreds of
fragrances  used  in  the  wide  variety  of
products  that  come  into  contact  with
the skin. In addition, with the advent of
aromatherapy, an increasing number of
patients have come to enjoy the olfac-
tory  sensation  that  they  experience
from  using  such  products.  Ironically,
the  very  ingredients  that  may  bring
some therapeutic relief by dint of their
scents may cause some irritation to the
skin.  The  roster  of  fragrances  in  prod-
ucts,  as  well  as  the  range  of  products
with fragrances added, has expanded as
has  the  list  of  fragrances  included  in
patch  testing  for  sensitivity  since  the
first  allergy  to  fragrance-based  chemi-
cals was identified in 1957. It is impor-
tant  that  cosmetic  dermatologists  and
aestheticians  be  aware  of  the  plethora
of chemicals that have been recognized
for provoking cutaneous reactions in a
distinct  but  sizable  minority  of
patients.

Preservatives

Edmund Weisberg, MS
Leslie Baumann, MD

Preservatives  are  integral  ingredients  in
various food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic,
and skin care formulations. As water is
included  in  the  majority  of  such  prod-
ucts, preservatives are added to prevent
the  growth  of  microorganisms  and  the
resultant  rapid  deterioration  or  decom-
position of the product. Indeed, without
preservatives, which are biocidal chemi-
cals, these items important to daily life
would  exhibit  little  to  no  shelf  life  and
become quickly invaded and permeated
by numerous bacteria, fungi, and molds.
As  such,  preservatives  are  intended  to
maintain  the  integrity  of  the  product
and  protect  the  user  from  infection.1
While  antimicrobial  preservatives  are
essential components in the majority of
cosmetics  and  skin  care  products,  these
ingredients have been cited frequently as
causes  of  allergic  contact  dermatitis.1–3
Such occurrences are most often associ-
ated  with  topical  application  on  dam-
aged or broken skin. Of greater concern
in recent years has been the reports link-
ing  the  use  of  some  skin  care  products
with cancer incidence. This chapter will
focus on the most frequently used class
of  preservatives,  recent  data  regarding
the  estrogenic  potential  of  these  com-
pounds,  and  the  controversy  regarding
possible  associations  between 
the
chronic  use  of  chemical  preservatives
that make contact with the skin and can-
cer.

PARABENS

Parabens,  alkyl  esters  of  p-hydroxyben-
zoic acid (PHBA), which are found natu-
rally in some fruits, are common ingredi-
ents in food, pharmaceuticals, as well as
numerous skin, hair, and body care prod-
ucts, and can sometimes produce allergic
reactions.4 Nevertheless,  parabens  are
the  most  widely  used  preservatives  in
cosmetics,5 and  are  used  in  the  vast
majority  of  skin  care  formulations.6 In
fact, about 25 years ago, it was estimated
that at least 90% of personal care prod-
ucts,  including  deodorants,  toothpaste,
shampoo,  body  cream,  shower  gels,
moisturizers, etc., contained one or more
parabens  as  a  preservative,7 because  of

the strong record of efficacy, safety, and
stability exhibited by this group of com-
pounds.  The  frequency  of  inclusion  of
these  ingredients  has  not  markedly
changed during the last quarter of a cen-
tury despite the introduction or synthe-
sis  of  new  substances.  The  use  of
parabens in pharamaceutical products as
preservatives  actually  dates  back  to  the
1920s.8 These chemicals have been gen-
erally regarded as safe because they are
quickly  absorbed  and  hydrolyzed  into
the less toxic PHBA.3 It is also worth not-
ing  that  the  metabolism  of  parabens  is
influenced  by  the  inclusion  in  cosmetic
preparations  of  penetration  enhancers,
which  facilitate  the  rapid  absorption  of
parabens  through  intact  skin.9,10 There
have  been  several  reports  of  contact
sensitivity  associated  with  cutaneous
exposure  to  parabens,  but  while  this
mechanism has not yet been fully eluci-
dated, such occurrences, as stated above,
are  linked  to  contact  with  damaged  or
broken skin.

The  family  of  parabens 

include
methyl  paraben  (MP),  ethyl  paraben,
butyl paraben, isobutyl paraben, propyl
paraben, isopropyl paraben, and benzyl
paraben.11 Methyl,  ethyl,  propyl,  and
butyl  paraben  are  the  most  frequently
used  parabens  in  cosmetic  formula-
tions12
(Table  37-1).  Notably,  these
chemicals  can  be  absorbed  through  the
skin  and  migrate  into  the  bloodstream
and bodily tissues.

Methyl Paraben

MP is the most common of the various
forms  of  parabens.  It  is  a  stable,  non-
volatile  substance  with  a  long  track
record  of  safe  use  in  foods,  drugs,  and
cosmetics.  MP  is  not  considered  to  be
irritating  or  sensitizing  to  individuals
with  normal  skin  (i.e.,  people  who  do
not  have  sensitive  skin).  A  literature

review conducted by Soni et al. in 2002
suggested  that  MP  is  thought  to  be
absorbed totally and avidly through the
skin as well as gastrointestinally metab-
olized into PHBA, before it is conjugated
and  eliminated  through  the  urine.
Notably, Soni et al. found no evidence of
cutaneous or systemic accumulation.13

incidence 

In  the  wake  of  the  reports  postulat-
ing a relationship between the chronic
use  of  parabens-containing  deodorant
and  breast  cancer 
(see
Parabens  and  Breast  Cancer  section),
some  investigators  have  undertaken
longer-term  examination  of  parabens
exposure  to  the  skin.  In  particular,
Ishiwitari  et  al.  considered  the  effects
of  daily  MP  use  on  human  skin.  They
measured  the  concentrations  of  the
preservative in the stratum corneum of
the  human  forearm  in  12  volunteers
after  1  month  of  twice-daily  applica-
tions  of  MP-containing  formulations,
and  also  investigated  the  long-term
effects of exposure on keratinocytes in
vitro. The investigators found that MP
was not completely metabolized, with
significant  increases  in  concentrations
in the stratum corneum measured after
1  month.  MP  was  also  found  to  have
reduced  the  proliferating  capacity  of
keratinocytes and altered cell morphol-
ogy. They speculated that the accumu-
lation of MP may be coordinated with
the  differentiation  and  aging  of  ker-
atinocytes,  and  suggested  that  further
research,  especially  in  vivo  study,  is
warranted  to  obtain  a  better  under-
standing  of  the  effects  of  daily  use  of
MP.3

In another recent study, Handa et al.
evaluated  the  effects  of  ultraviolet-B
(UVB) exposure on human keratinocytes
treated with MP. Their approach was to
culture  HaCaT  cells  in  MP-containing
medium  for  24  hours  before  exposing
the medium to 15 or 30 mJ/cm2 of UVB,
and  then  culturing  for  an  additional  24
hours. While a 0.003% concentration of
MP exhibited no impact on HaCaT cell
viability  and  UVB  irradiation  alone
induced  little  or  no  necrosis  of  ker-
atinocytes, a 0.003% MP concentration
was  found  to  significantly  enhance
UVB-induced apoptosis as well as oxida-
tive  stress,  nitric  oxide  synthesis,  lipid
peroxidation,  and  transcription  factor
activation  of  the  keratinocytes.  The
investigators concluded that the combi-
nation  of  MP  and  UV  may  impose
deleterious  effects  on  human  skin.
Consequently,  they  are  investigating

normal  human  keratinocytes  and  are
conducting

MP-treated animal skin.14

Parabens and Breast Cancer?

the 

from 

A recent study aimed at identifying and
characterizing  the  toxicology  of  prod-
ucts 
reaction  between
parabens  and  singlet  oxygen  revealed
that  parabens  may  engender  oxidative
stress  in  the  skin  following  conversion
to  glutathione  conjugates  of  hydro-
quinone,  through  reaction  with  glu-
tathione and singlet oxygen.15 While this
finding  warrants  further  research,  any
reaction to it would likely pale in com-
parison  to  a  controversial  study  pub-
lished by Byford et al. in January 2002.
In  this  report,  investigators  noted  high
concentrations  of  parabens  in  breast
cancer tissue, as they identified a weak
estrogenic effect exhibited by MP, ethyl
paraben, n-propyl paraben, and n-butyl
paraben  in  estrogen-dependent  MCF7
human breast cancer cells.16 Significantly,
they concluded that additional research
would be needed to ascertain the extent
of  paraben  accumulation  in  estrogen-
sensitive tissues.

Rumors  that  using  antiperspirants
could  cause  breast  cancer  ensued  in
mainstream circulation over the Internet
and beyond during much of the remain-
der of the year and may persist in many
circles despite the lack of evidence and,
in some cases, reports to the contrary. A
population-based  case–control  study
published  near  the  end  of  2002  evalu-
ated the relationship between underarm
antiperspirant/deodorant use and breast
cancer risk in women between the ages
of  20  and  74  (813  cases  and  793
controls).  Breast  cancer  risk  was  not
found  to  increase  based  on  antiperspi-
rant or deodorant use generally, or use of
such products among those who shaved
with a blade razor, or use of such prod-
ucts  within  1  hour  of  shaving.  Thus,
investigators concluded that their results
did  not  support  the  theory  that  breast
cancer  risk  is  increased  by  the  use  of
antiperspirant products.17 A more recent
review  expressed  less  certainty  as  to
whether the use of underarm antiperspi-
rant products elevates the risk of human
breast cancer.18 In that study, which was
the  first  study  to  evaluate  the  intensity
of  underarm  exposure  in  a  cohort  of
breast cancer survivors, results from the
437  women  assessed  revealed  that  an
earlier  age  of  breast  cancer  diagnosis
was  associated  with  frequency  and
earlier onset of antiperspirant/deodorant

usage  combined  with  underarm  shav-
ing.  Investigators  concluded  that  while
underarm  shaving  with  antiperspirant/
deodorant  usage  may  contribute  to
breast  cancer,  case–control  studies  are
necessary to arrive at appropriate recom-
mendations 
for  alternative  axillary
hygiene.19 A  review  published  even
more recently states that while no asso-
ciation  between  parabens  in  cosmetics
and  skin  care  products  has  been  estab-
lished, this is because the necessary stud-
ies have not yet been conducted, not that
some effects have not been identified.20

Additional Responses 
to the Controversy

Soni et al. have stated in multiple articles
that parabens are virtually nontoxic, and
quickly  absorbed,  metabolized,  and
excreted  in  urine.8,13,21 They  have  also
not  found  carcinogenic  potential  to  be
associated  with  parabens  in  reviews  of
the literature. In reference to the contro-
versy pertaining to the study by Byford
et  al.,  they  argue  that  the  evidence  is
ambiguous  at  best  regarding  the  estro-
genic  risks  of  parabens,  noting  that  the
available  studies  do  not  consider  the
dose-,  route-,  and  species-dependent
metabolism  and  elimination  rates  of
parabens.  They  do,  however,  conclude
that  a  study  of  reproductive  toxicity
may be useful.8

Darbre  responded  to  the  furor  over
the  suggestions  of  an  etiologic  connec-
tion  between  underarm  cosmetics  and
breast  cancer  by  noting  that  the
strongest  supportive  evidence  of  this
contention  was  the  unaccounted  for
clinical observations revealing a dispro-
portionately  high  incidence  of  breast
cancer  in  the  upper  outer  quadrant  of
the  breast,  proximate  to  where  these
products are applied. He suggested that
such  data  should  prompt  multidiscipli-
nary research to ascertain the effects of
the  long-term  use  of  the  constituent
chemicals of underarm cosmetics.22 In a
commentary on Darbre’s article, Harvey
acknowledged  that  while  parabens  are
generally regarded as safe, recent reports
have indicated estrogenic effects associ-
ated  with  these  preservatives.  He
echoed  Darbre’s  call  for  additional
research on underarm cosmetics, partic-
ularly on components facilitating estro-
genic activity, noting the paucity of data
on the long-term effects of weakly estro-
genic chemicals on human health.23 In a
subsequent  article  by  Harvey  and
Darbre, the authors suggest that should
further data on the influence of topically
applied  paraben-containing  products

indicate  adverse  effects  on  human
health  via  endocrine  disruption,  this
mode  of  interruption,  given  the  clarity
of  exposure,  should  be  more  amenable
to assessment, measurement, and inter-
vention.  Further,  they  suggest  that  the
potential  public  health  impact  and  the
size  of  the  exposed  population  should
provide incentive for study.24

It is important to realize that the pres-
ence  of  parabens  in  the  breast  cancer
tumors identified in the Byford study is
not  evidence  of  a  causal  link  between
parabens and breast cancer, cosmetics in
general and breast cancer, or even under-
arm  products  and  breast  cancer.  If
parabens ultimately turn out to be impli-
cated in the etiologic pathway of certain
breast  cancers  or  other  tumors,  it  is
worth  remembering  that  parabens  are
used in food products as well,13 leaving
the source of potential causal factors dif-
ficult to identify. As yet, no one has any
idea (or has evaluated) whether it is the
consumption of parabens or their appli-
cation to the skin that is responsible for
their presence in human tissue. In addi-
tion, no one knows what the presence of
parabens 
in  human  tissue  means.
Nevertheless,  such  studies  raise  impor-
tant questions.

The Estrogenicity of Parabens

Using  the  uterotrophic  assay  in  imma-
ture  and  adult  ovariectomized  CD1
mice  and  in  immature  Wistar  rats,
Lemini  et  al.  subcutaneously  injected
animals for three consecutive days with
various  doses  of  parabens  or  vehicle.
They  found  that  uterine  weight  was
increased and all parabens but MP com-
peted  with  estradiol  for  estrogen  bind-
ing  sites.  The  investigators  concluded
that their in vivo and in vitro data con-
firm  the  estrogenicity  of  parabens.25
Lemini  et  al.  followed  up  on  these
results  by  presenting  a  morphometric
analysis  of  the  uteri  from  mice  treated
with parabens compared with estradiol
that  confirmed  the  induction  of  estro-
genic histologic alterations in the uteri of
ovariectomized mice.26

Acknowledging  the  various  estro-
genic effects of parabens seen recently in
vivo,  Prusakiewicz  et  al.  hypothesized
that parabens increase estrogen levels by
inhibiting  estrogen  sulfotransferases
(SULTs) in skin. They tested this theory
in  human  skin  cytosolic  fractions  and
normal  human  epidermal  keratinocytes
(NHEKs).  The  investigators  found  that
SULT inhibition potency increased with
increasing  length  of  the  paraben  ester
chain, with butyl paraben displaying the

greatest inhibitory capacity, suppressing
cutaneous cytosol sulfation of estradiol,
and  estrone  thus  potentially  increasing
local  estrogen  levels.  They  concluded
that  the  estrogenicity  of  parabens
included  in  topical  skin  care  products
and  medications  may  promote  or  con-
tribute to cutaneous antiaging benefits.27
The level of estrogenicity bears scrutiny
in  future  studies  given  the  seemingly
fine line between the potential salutary,
antiaging effects of estrogen, as well as
the detrimental, carcinogenic activity.

While  acknowledging  the  weakly
estrogenic activity of parabens identified
in  recent  in  vitro  tests  and  reported  in
vivo  effects  such  as  increased  uterine
weight  associated  with  butyl,  isobutyl,
and benzyl paraben and male reproduc-
tive  effects  linked  to  butyl  and  propyl
paraben,  Golden  et  al.  argued  that  the
parabens with demonstrated activity are
several  orders  of  magnitude  less  active
than estrogen and that it is “biologically
implausible”  that  parabens  could  raise
the risk of any estrogen-mediated health
effects.  Further,  they  concluded  that  a
worst-case  scenario  in  terms  of  daily
parabens  exposure  would  pose  signifi-
cantly  less  risk  as  compared  to  the  risk
to  naturally-occurring
of  exposure 
chemicals
dietary  endocrine-active 
(EACs)  such  as  the  phytoestrogen
daidzein (an isoflavone found in soy).11

GENERAL STUDIES

Hussein  et  al.  set  out  to  ascertain  the
permeation  of  methyl,  ethyl,  propyl,
and  butyl  paraben  through  the  epider-
mal  and  dermal  layers  as  well  as  accu-
mulation  in  the  skin  layers  and/or  pas-
sage to other bodily tissues. They found
that the capacity of the various parabens
to penetrate the skin was based on their
relative  lipophilicity—with  the  more
lipophilic,  the  less  they  were  likely  to
penetrate  or  cross  skin  layers.12 Butyl
paraben  is  the  most  lipophilic  of  the
four, followed by propyl, ethyl, and MP.
The  most  lipophilic  paraben,  butyl
paraben, displayed comparatively weak
passage through the skin, and has been
shown  elsewhere  to  have  the  potential
for accumulating in the skin, particularly
after multiple or frequent applications.28
Nicotinamide,  the  biologically  active
amide  of  vitamin  B3,  is  a  hydrophilic
molecule used as an active ingredient in
cosmetic formulations for its moisturiz-
ing  and  depigmenting  activity  (see
Chapter 33). In a recent study, it has also
been  shown  to  have  the  capacity  to
influence the transdermal permeation of

methyl,  ethyl,  propyl,  and  butyl
paraben. Specifically, nictotinamide was
found  to  promote  the  dissolution  of
parabens in solutions and gels and lower
parabens  partitioning  in  the  oily  phase
thus  ensuring  an  effective  water-phase
concentration in emulsion. Investigators
concluded  that  nicotinamide  interacts
with parabens by ultimately decreasing
transdermal penetration, thereby dimin-
ishing the risk or potential for toxicity.29
Interestingly, Lee et al. have noted the
dearth  of  studies  evaluating  the  effects
of a combination of preservatives in cos-
metic  formulations  even  though  such
products  more  often  include  a  mixture
of  preservatives  rather  than  a  single
preservative. In response, they set out to
evaluate  the  side  effects  of  cosmetic
preservatives alone or in combination as
product ingredients and to assess objec-
tive  and  subjective  sensory  skin  irrita-
tion  (representing  symptoms  such  as
burning,  stinging,  and  itching  absent
visual  inflammation).  The  researchers
found  no  significant  differences  among
MP,  ethyl  paraben,  propyl  paraben,
butyl  paraben,  phenoxyethanol,  and
chlorphenesin in objective skin irritation
potential at the minimal inhibitory con-
centration. However, chlorphenesin was
found to exhibit greater potential in sub-
jective  irritation.  They  also  found  that
formulation type influenced sensory irri-
tation and that the combination of phe-
noxyethanol  and  chlorphenesin  signifi-
cantly increased irritation.30

It  is  worth  noting  that  in  a  review  of
the major classes of preservatives as well
as newer agents such as Euxyl K 400 and
isopropynyl  butylcarbamate,  Sasseville
concludes  that  while  an  ideal  preserva-
tive,  effective  without  potential  for  pro-
voking irritancy or sensitivity, has not yet
been identified, the parabens, which have
been used for three-quarters of a century,
continue to be the most frequently used
preservatives  while  inducing  sensitivity
less often than newer biocides.1

SUMMARY

In  recent  years,  some  concerns  have
been  raised  regarding  possible  links
between  some  cosmetic  products  and
breast cancer incidence. In particular, an
estrogenic potential has been reported in
association  with  parabens  contained  in
underarm  deodorant,  given  their  fre-
quency of use and proximate location to
the human breast and the identification
of parabens in breast cancer tissue. It is
not  uncommon  for  patients  to  bring
questions to a physician based on main-

stream  news  reports  on  medical  issues.
The initial report in 2002 and its rever-
berating effects in the literature reached
public  awareness  and  have  prompted
some  lingering  concerns  regarding  the
risks  of  common  skin  care  product
ingredients.  Even  if  patients  are  not
broaching such issues, it is important to
be prepared to inform them that nearly
all skin care and cosmetic products con-
tain  preservatives.  While  these  ingredi-
ents are generally regarded as safe, cer-
tain  risks  are  associated  with  their  use.
In  particular,  some  individuals  may  be
found  to  be  allergic  to  certain  com-
pounds.  Damaged  or  wounded  skin
may  be  especially  susceptible  to  some
chemical  preservatives.  In  addition,  the
effects  from  the  chronic  use  of  some
products  may  not  be  fully  understood.
This  notion  could  be  a  pivotal  point  in
the context of recommending daily use
of certain products such as sunscreens. It
is within this context that the dermatol-
ogist  should  be  familiar  with  preserva-
tives  in  general  and  the  benefits  and
risks of the most common preservatives
in particular.

Products  containing  parabens  should
be  avoided  by  most  people  who  know
they are allergic to parabens, which can
be  determined  by  patch  testing.  There
are  no  convincing  data  that  parabens
cause harm to those not allergic to these
compounds. Because of some sensation-
alistic reporting in recent years, though,
many  are  choosing  to  avoid  products
containing  this  class  of  preservative
ingredients. Again, for those not allergic
to  parabens,  there  are  no  scientifically
the
established 
plethora of cosmetic and skin care prod-
ucts  that  contain  these  preservatives.
Much  more  research  is  necessary  to
determine if what appears to be a rela-
tively  weak  level  of  estrogenicity  in
parabens can promote carcinogenesis.

Patients  can  be  directed  to  health
food  stores,  chains  such  as  Whole
Foods, or Internet resources for products
that are touted for excluding parabens or
other preservatives if they express such
interest.  It  is  important  to  advise  them
that  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  such
products  may  be  questionable  and
surely not established through random-
ized, double-blind clinical trials.

Bioengineering of 
the Skin

Leslie Baumann, MD
Mari Paz Castanedo-Tardan, MD

Bioengineering of the skin is a scientific
discipline  devoted  to  developing  stan-
dardized methodologies to measure skin
findings  in  a  scientific  manner.  The
International Society for Bioengineering
of the Skin has its own journal and there
are  multiple  books  published  on  these
methods. It is vital to understand these
methodologies  in  order  to  effectively
evaluate the scientific merit of studies in
the  dermatology  literature.  These  mea-
surements allow the cosmetic dermatol-
ogist to evaluate the efficacy of particu-
lar 
to  objectively
measure  treatment  outcomes.  These
tests  are  a  necessary  addition  to  cos-
metic  dermatology  clinical  trials  and
they aid cosmetic dermatologists in their
pursuit  of  practicing  evidence-based
medicine in a cosmetic setting.

SUBJECTIVE MEASUREMENTS

The Lactic Acid Stinging Test

Even when this method lacks objective
criteria, this test is widely accepted as a
marker  of  sensitivity  and  as  a  standard
method  for  evaluating  individuals  who
report invisible and subjective cutaneous
irritation. Stinging is considered to be a
variant of pain that develops rapidly and
fades  quickly  any  time  the  appropriate
sensory  nerves  are  stimulated1
(see
Chapter  17).  In  one  study,  Frosch  and
Kligman  applied  5%  lactic  acid  to  the
nasolabial fold (a site highly innervated
with  sensory  fibers),  when  the  subject
was  sweating  profusely.2 Under  these
conditions,  approximately  20%  of  the
research group reported experiencing an
unpleasant  sensation.  In  a  different
study, Seidenari et al. applied 10% lactic
acid  solution  to  the  nasolabial  fold  and
observed  that  individuals  with  “sensi-
tive  skin”  experienced  a  much  stronger
stinging  sensation  than  those  in  the
healthy control group.3 However, not all
studies agree that patients with sensitive
skin are more likely to be “stingers.” In
order  to  achieve  a  more  reliable
response, applying an inert control sub-
stance  such  as  saline  solution  to  the

contralateral  test  site  is  recommended.
In  addition  to  lactic  acid,  other  water-
soluble substances such as capsaicin can
be used.

a  poor  correlation  between  whealing
and  itching  since  the  dimensions  of  a
wheal  do  not  correlate  with  the  inten-
sity of pruritus.6

The Chloroform Methanol and Sorbic
Acid Tests

Like  the  test  mentioned  above,  these
may  help  the  practitioner  identify
patients  with  sensitive  skin.  In  these
procedures,  the  practitioner  applies  the
substance  to  the  face  of  the  patient  to
determine if stinging or burning occurs.4

Challenge Patch Test

This test uses sodium lauryl sulfate and
other  detergents  that  are  known  to  be
irritants. The irritants are placed on the
skin to determine a patient’s sensitivity.
In cases of an impaired epidermal water
barrier,  demonstrated  by 
increased
transepidermal  water  loss  (TEWL),  the
detergents  will  be  more  likely  to  cause
irritation.  This  test  is  used  to  examine
epidermal barrier function. In one study,
the  purpose  was  to  discover  whether
“stingers”  (patients  with  sensitive  skin)
might  represent  an  easily  and  rapidly
identifiable  subpopulation  with  a  more
generally  increased  tendency  to  mani-
fest  skin  responses.  The  response  to  a
0.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate patch test
was  assessed  in  a  group  of  25  stingers
and compared to the response in 25 non-
stingers.  There  was  no  difference  in
either the pattern or strength of the irri-
tant response assessed by subjective ery-
thema and dryness scores. The data sug-
gest that there is no correlation between
the  susceptibility  of  an  individual  to  a
skin  stinging  response  and  an  irritation
reaction.5

Evaluation of Itch Response

An itch response can be experimentally
induced by topical or intradermal injec-
tions  of  various  substances  such  as
vasoactive  agents,  mast  cell  degranula-
tors,  and  proteolytic  enzymes.  One  of
the most common procedures to induce
itching  is  the  intradermal  injection  of
histamine (100 (cid:14)g in 1 mL of saline) in
the  subject’s  forearm.  Information  is
then  obtained  by  the  subject’s  self-
assessment  regarding  the  intensity  of
the  itch  using  a  predetermined  grading
scale. By using a similar evaluation tech-
nique  (application  of  topical  4%  hista-
mine  in  a  group  of  healthy  young
females), Grove postulated that there is

Thermal Sensation Test

In  dermatology,  thermal  somatosen-
sory  testing  is  becoming  the  most  uti-
lized quantitative sensory testing (QST)
technique.7 It  assesses  the  function  of
free nerve endings of both small myeli-
nated  and  nonmyelinated  fibers.  By
attaching  a  small  device  called  a  ther-
mode to  the  patient’s  skin,  thresholds
for  warmth,  cold,  as  well  as  hot  and
cold  pain,  are  measured  quantitatively
and  then  compared  with  age-matched
normal  population  values.  Any  devia-
tion  from  the  normal  range  indicates
the  existence  of  peripheral  nerve  dis-
ease.1 The  thermode is  capable  of  heat-
ing  or  cooling  the  skin  as  needed.  In
contact  with  the  skin,  it  produces  a
intensity  of  which
stimulus 
increases or decreases until the subject
feels the sensation. The subject is then
asked  to  indicate  the  intensity  of  the
sensation  using  a  predetermined  scale.
In  the  center  of  the  thermode a  thermo-
couple records  the  temperature.  TSA-II
(Medoc Company, Ramat Yishai, Israel)
is considered one of the most advanced
testing
portable 
devices.  It  operates  between  0(cid:16)C  and
54(cid:16)C  and  measures  the  threshold  for
four sensory submodalities: Warm sen-
sation,  cold  sensation,  heat-induced
pain,  and  cold-induced  pain,  of  which
the last is the most difficult to assess.

Washing Test
In the washing test,8 subjects are asked
to wash their face using a specific foam-
ing  agent  such  as  soap  or  detergent.
After  washing,  subjects  are  asked  to
evaluate, according to a point scale, indi-
vidual  sensations  of  tightness,  burning,
itching, and stinging. The aim of this test
is to identify a subpopulation of people
with an increased tendency to produce a
skin response.1

Exaggerated Immersion Tests

For  this  test,  baseline  skin  parameters
are  evaluated.  Then,  a  subject’s  hands
and  forearms  are  soaked  in  a  solution
of  anionic  surfactants  such  as  soap,
0.05%  sodium 
laureth  sulfate,  or
0.35% paraffin sulfonate at 40(cid:16)C for 20
minutes.  After  soaking,  hands  and

forearms are rinsed with tap water and

repeated  2  more  times,  with  a  2-hour
period between each soaking for 2 con-
secutive  days.  Skin  parameters  are
evaluated  2  hours  after  the  third  and
sixth  soakings  and  18  hours  after  the
last  soaking.  All  skin  parameters  are
performed  after  the  subject  has  rested
at  least  30  minutes  in  a  21  (cid:15) 1

environment.1

OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENTS

Thermography

This  mode  of  measurement  appears  to
aid  in  the  visualization  of  the  extent  of
skin damage resulting from bad sunburns
or  exposure  to  irritant  chemicals.9 The
heat loss detected through thermography
can indicate areas of damage on the face.
The  “hot”  areas  may  correlate  with
regions  demonstrating  increased  blood
flow. Thermography essentially provides
a  temperature  map  of  skin  surface  tem-
perature,  which  in  turn  is  a  marker  for
elevated  metabolic  rate,  signaling  skin
irritation.

Laser Doppler Velocimetry

This technology uses optical methods to
provide  a  noninvasive  and  continuous
way to record cutaneous blood flow of
the  superficial  skin  layers.  It  is  used  to
evaluate  the  effects  on  blood  flow  of
topically  applied  ingredients.  It  is  also
useful  in  evaluating  the  degree  of  skin
irritation,  given  that  the  degree  of  the
experimentally  induced  irritant  contact
dermatitis  usually  correlates  well  with

the  blood  flow  detected  by  the  laser
Doppler velocimetry (LDV).

The Evaporimeter or Tewameter
(Transepidermal Water Loss)

This  instrument  measures  water  loss
from  the  skin  indicating  disruption  of
the stratum corneum (SC) (Fig. 38-1). Of
course, TEWL is an important indicator
of SC functioning. Diminished function
of  the  SC  disrupts  the  skin  barrier 
resulting in increased TEWL. Maibach et
al. showed over a decade ago that TEWL
increases  at  sites  of  damage,  especially
in  people  with  a  positive  dermatologic
history  as  well  as  hand  and  facial  der-
matitis,  contact  dermatitis,  metal  der-
matitis, and textile itching.10 Most cuta-
neous diseases that are characterized by
abnormalities in the normal terminal dif-
ferentiation process of keratinocytes are
often associated with high TEWL. Also,
high  TEWL  is  correlated  with  easier,
higher permeability by external irritants,
hence  TEWL  implies  elevated  sensitiv-
ity.  The  evaporimeter  test  therefore
appears to offer high sensitivity but low
specificity  in  diagnosing  sensitive  skin.
(For more information, see Ref. 11.)

The Red-Wine Provocation Test
Patients  report  a  sense  of  warmth
beginning  around  the  head  or  neck  area
and  moving  upward  on  the  face  10  to 
15 minutes after ingestion of six ounces of
red  wine.  Within  30  minutes,  flushing
becomes  clinically  evident.9 The  disad-
vantage of this test, though, is that it lacks
specificity—it  may  be  positive  when
other conditions, such as rosacea or alco-
hol dehydrogenase syndrome, are present.

Sebutape

This tool allows for the quantitative and
objective  visualization  of  sebum  excre-
tion.  The  amount  and  distribution  of
sebum  vary  individually,  of  course.
People  with  excess  sebum  (i.e.,  oily
skin)  are  also  more  likely  to  develop
acne and, therefore, are probably more
sensitive to breakouts when using topi-
cal products. This objective assessment
of sebum excretion may be superior to
the  subjective  impression  of  skin  type.
Manufacturers market product lines and
cosmetics  for  various  skin  types.  The
subjective  impression  of  skin  type  can
lead an individual to select an unsuitable
product, i.e., one that produces discom-
fort after application.9 The Sebumeter is
a photometric device whereby a special
plastic strip is placed on a patient’s skin
and  then  inserted  into  the  instrument.
The  plastic  strip  absorbs  the  lipids  on
the  skin  surface  and  becomes  more
transparent.  The  device  measures  the
transparency and therefore sebum based
on  the  light  transmission  through  the
strip. The Sebumeter® (SM 815; Courage-
Khazaka,  Köln,  Germany)  is  commer-
cially  available  on  the  market  and  has
been  utilized  in  several  studies  for  the
measurement of facial sebum.

SEBUTAPE  METHOD  This  is  a  more  accu-
rate and faster technique using a polymer
film  to  measure  lipid  absorption.  The
tape  absorbs  sebum  and
polymer 
becomes transparent to light afterwards.
Sebutape can be analyzed in many ways,
the easiest of which is the visual scoring
of the tapes on a 1 to 5 scale (Fig. 38-2).

The pH Meter

The use of a pH meter with a flat surface
glass  electrode  permits  better  contact
between the probe and the skin surface.
Skin  itself  is  slightly  acidic,  with  a  pH
ranging  from  4  to  6,  depending  on  the
area of skin and the individual’s age. In
one  study,  investigators  reported  a
higher  pH  in  the  skin  of  subjects  with
eczematous diseases.3 Bacterial prolifera-
tion on the skin is limited by the skin’s
acidic  pH  level.  Products  that  raise  the
cutaneous  pH  also  promote  bacterial
growth.  The  physiologic  pH  value  of
skin is an average measure of 5.5. Such a
pH is essential for maintaining the capac-
ity  of  the  skin  for  bacteriologic  resis-
tance.  Buffering  substances  in  the  skin,
which maintain the cutaneous pH of the
skin at its nearly constant level, are able
to neutralize small quantities of topically
applied acidic or alkaline agents thereby
reducing their irritancy.12 The greater the

 
 
 
solution  of  toluidine  blue  and  basic
fuchsin in 30% alcohol, followed by rins-
ing with regular tap water. Measurements
of the colors of the sample are made using
a reflectance colorimeter. Then, a trained
person scores the discs with a microscope
at  20x  magnification  as  follows:  Inter-
corneocyte cohesion: 0 (cid:12) large sheet; 1 (cid:12)
large  clusters  (cid:4) a  few  isolated  cells; 
2 (cid:12) small clusters (cid:4) many isolated cells;
3 (cid:12) large amount of dye in cells, but uni-
form; 4 (cid:12) important staining in all cells,
often with grains.20

The Corneometer (Corneometry)

This  is  an  effective  tool  for  determining
skin  surface  hydration  and  it  helps  to
measure the electrical capacitance of the
SC.  Water  exhibits  the  highest  dielectric
constant in the skin. A rise in water con-
tent  causes  an  increase  in  capacitance 
values.3 Although corneometer measure-
ments are related to water content of the
SC, they are not directly related to TEWL.
A  healthy  SC  has  both  a  low  TEWL  (a
nonleaky  barrier)  and  a  high  electrical
capacitance (high water content).

The Cutometer

This  is  a  suction  device  that  measures
viscoelasticity of the skin (Fig. 38-3). The
Cutometer measures the amount of skin
elevation  caused  by  the  suction  force
over a defined area of the skin.21 In order
to  receive  accurate  readings  with  this
instrument, the experimental conditions
must be well controlled. Various parame-
ters  such  as  load  (vacuum),  aperture  of
the suction device, position and pressure
of application of the probe, time of appli-
cation and relaxation, and pretension of
the  skin  must  be  kept  constant.  When
used  properly,  the  Cutometer  provides
reproducible  and  accurate  stress-strain
and strain-time curves. These data yield
quantitative information concerning the
purely elastic and viscoelastic properties
of the dermis.

The Reviscometer

Using a Reviscometer RVM 600 (Courage
&  Khazaka  Electronic  GmbH,  Köln,
Germany), Ruvolo and his team from the
Johnson  &  Johnson  Consumer  Com-
panies,  Inc.  proposed  a  new  methodol-
ogy for documenting the age-dependent
changes  of  the  mechanical  properties  of
the skin.22 This method is based on deter-
mining the directional dependence of the
speed  of  an  acoustic  shear  wave  on  the
skin  surface  at  intervals  of  3  degrees.
Based on the angular distribution of the
resonance running time they defined two

capacity of skin is due especially to the
lactic  acid/lactate  system.  Sweat  glands

quantity accounts for the relatively con-

The Chromameter (Colorimetry)

This  instrument  is  useful  for  assessing
skin color, which is expressed in a three-
dimensional  space.  Light  from  a  xenon
flash  lamp  illuminates  a  1-cm  diameter
circular  area  of  the  skin  and  the
reflected,  tricolor  decomposed  light  is
analyzed for its intensity (luminosity, L*)
and the color components red–green (a*)
and  blue–yellow  (b*).13 Erythema  is
measured  on  the  red–green  scale  and
pigment is measured on the luminosity
scale. The chromameter effectively aids
the practitioner in looking for increased
redness, which is a sign of irritation and
sensitivity.  The  chromameter  can  also
be  useful  in  detecting  improvement  or
worsening  of  pigmentation  disorders
such as melasma.

Corneosurfametry

Using  reflectance  colorimetry,  this
method studies the interaction between
the  human  SC.14
surfactants  and 
Cyanoacrylate  skin  surface  stripping
(CSSS) is taken from the volar aspect of
the  subject’s  forearm  and  then  sprayed
with  the  surfactant  to  be  tested.  After 
2  hours,  the  sample  is  rinsed  with  tap
water  and  stained  with  basic  fuchsin

and  toluidine  blue  dyes  for  a  period  of 
3 minutes. Once the sample has dried, it
is placed on a white reference plate and
measured  by  reflectance  colorimetry
using, for example, a ChromaMeter CR-
200  (Minolta,  Osaka,  Japan).  Then,  the
index of redness is taken as a parameter
of the irritation caused by the surfactant.
When  water  alone  is  sprayed  on  the
sample, the index has a value of 68 (cid:15) 4,
and  when  stronger  surfactants  are
applied, the values decline. Piérard et al.
showed  that  corneosurfametry  corre-
lates  well  with  in  vivo  testing  when
evaluating surfactant-induced dermatitis
in subjects with sensitive skin, and that
corneosurfametry  shows  less  interindi-
vidual  variability  than  in  vivo  testing,
thus  allowing  for  better  discrimination
when dealing with mild irritants.15

Squamometry

This  measurement  technique  has  been
postulated  to  be  an  effective  way  to
study  and  quantify  nonerythematous
irritant dermatitis and a reliable method
to  investigate  the  interaction  of  surfac-
tants with the skin surface.16 It is a non-
invasive,  protein-dependent,  colorimet-
ric evaluation of the level of alteration in
the corneocyte layer collected by adhe-
sive-coated  discs,  which  allow  for  the
quantification of xerotic and inflamma-
tory  changes  in  the  SC.17,18 A  short
period of applying the discs to the skin
(15 s) enables the harvesting of superfi-
cial  corneocytes  (superficial  squamo-
metry), while a longer application time (1
hour)  collects  a  thicker  layer  of  corneo-
cytes (deep squamometry).18,19 The discs
are  then  stained  for  30  seconds  with  a

 
 
 
 
ing the adverse effects of sun exposure.
By using photography in daily practice,
patients feel more involved in their skin
care and this may lead to increased com-
pliance  with  treatment  plans  and  sun-
screen application.

UV Light Photography

This method utilizes UV light for evaluat-
ing the skin surface. A filter is placed on
the  camera  lens  that  only  allows  the
transmission of the desired UV light spec-
trum.  Epidermal  changes,  including  the
pigment network of the skin surface, are
visualized by using this method while the
dermal  component  is  eliminated.  This
allows  the  physician  to  evaluate  epider-
mal pigment alterations without the influ-
ence of the dermal pigment network.

Polarized Light Photography

The light reflected from the skin consists
of  two  elements:  “regular  reflectance”
light.28
(glare)  and  “back  scattered” 
Polarized light photography uses the two
mentioned types of reflected light to illus-
trate  epidermal  and  dermal  components
of the skin. While the regular reflectance
provides assessment of the epidermis, the
back-scattered light illustrates the dermal
components of the skin.28 This is handled
by the orientation of the filters in the cam-
era. If the lens filter is parallel to the flash
filter,  only  the  regular  reflectance  is
allowed to transit through, while the per-
pendicular  orientation  permits  the  trans-
mission of the back-scattered light.28 This
method is useful in assessing the epider-
mal and dermal components of skin inde-
pendent of each other.

TruVu Digital Imaging System

Developed  by  Johnson  &  Johnson
Consumer Companies, Inc., TruVu (Fig.
38-4) is  a  facial  imaging  system  that
accurately  provides  revealing  photos
and  objective  measures  of  subdermal
conditions. It is very useful in a clinical
dermatology  practice  or  an  aestheti-
cian’s office because it has the ability to
track  improvements  in  the  patient’s
skin. Over the past decade, the company
has conducted more than 100 clinical tri-
als of its skincare products and amassed
a  database  of  more  than  40,000  con-
sumer images. In the process, the imag-
ing system has been improved, becom-
ing smaller, more flexible, and portable.
The current system pinpoints conditions
on and below the surface of the skin in a
series of five images of each client’s face.
All five images are captured in approxi-
mately 10 seconds. This imaging system

parameters: the ansitropy and the angular
dispersion width. According to their find-
ings,  with  increasing  age  the  ansitropy
increases,  while  the  angular  dispersion
width decreases. The ratio of these two
values provides a sensitive parameter for
the  assessment  of  the  behavior  of  the
mechanical properties of the skin, and is
also capable of demonstrating the differ-
ences in skin viscoelasticity from infants
up to adults 75 years of age.

Dermaﬂex

This instrument also measures the elas-
tic  properties  of  the  skin  using  suction.
However, in contrast to the Cutometer,
which uses a disproportional superficial
strain method, this device uses a propor-
tional full-thickness strain method. The
Cutometer  is  more  often  used  for  cos-
metic  studies  and  Dermaflex  is  used
more often in dermatologic studies.21

Optical Proﬁlometry

This  technique  requires  the  use  of  sili-
cone  rubber  casts  that  are  made  of  the
skin’s surface. These casts are then ana-
lyzed  using  optical  profilometry  based
on  digital  image  processing  in  the  fol-
lowing  manner.  Tangential  lighting  is
cast  across  the  replicas.  The  degree  of
skin  surface  irregularities  is  then  mea-
sured  by  means  of  a  digital  camera  to
show  the  fractional  area  of  shadows  in
the replica. If the surface is smooth, there
will  be  fewer  shadows,  whereas  for  a
rough  and  wrinkled  surface,  the  shad-
owed  areas  will  increase.23 The  values
across 10 equally-spaced horizontal seg-
ments  are  plotted  to  generate  profiles
reflecting  the  surface  features  at  these

specific  locations.  Computerized  image
analysis of skin replicas has been used in
several  studies.24–26 A  good  correlation
has been observed between the profilo-
metric results and clinical observations.27

Ultraviolet Light

Ultraviolet (UV) light is widely used by
dermatologists in diagnosing certain dis-
orders  of  skin  pigmentation.  UV  lamps
usually  emit  a  light  spectrum  of  300  to
400  nm.  The  melanin  in  the  epidermis
absorbs and accentuates under the light.
Wood’s light (360 nm) is a useful instru-
ment 
for  assessing  patients  with
melasma. If an epidermal component is
present,  the  hyperpigmented  areas  are
viewed  as  darker  than  the  surrounding
epidermis, while the dermal component
will  not  appear  any  different  than  nor-
mal  epidermis.  Conversely,  in  patients
with  vitiligo,  the  hypopigmented  spots
will  light  up  under  the  illumination,
indicating the lack of melanin.

Photography

Photographic  illustrations  of  skin  are
becoming  more  popular  in  the  field  of
dermatology.  In  the  past,  photographs
were mainly used in the before and after
treatment  scenario  to  monitor  the  suc-
cess of therapy. Recently, through differ-
ent techniques, they have also been used
to  demonstrate  epidermal  and  dermal
changes, including in the superficial vas-
culature network as well as sun damage
and  pigment  alterations.  In  addition  to
helping  physicians  select  the  appropri-
ate  treatment  plan,  the  patients  are
afforded the opportunity to visualize the
undesired  changes  of  their  skin  includ-

 
 
 
inflammatory  skin  conditions  including
psoriasis35 and  contact  dermatitis.36 Of
note, CLSM is still considered an experi-
mental  device  in  basic  and  clinical
science and more research is warranted
for  its  application  in  the  diagnosis  of
skin conditions.

Dermoscopy

lentigines 

Dermoscopy, also known as epilumines-
cence  microscopy,  is  a  noninvasive
method useful in evaluation of morpho-
logic  features  of  cutaneous  lesions.
Although utilized in both pigmented and
nonpigmented  neoplasms,  it  is  mostly
used  to  differentiate  benign  pigmented
lesions such as seborrheic keratoses and
from  malignant
solar 
melanomas.  Dermoscopy  is  based  on
several  criteria  including  pigment  net-
work, structural pattern, lesional border,
and symmetry.28 While benign nevi illus-
trate  symmetry,  regular  borders,  and  a
pigment network, melanomas are asym-
metric  and  show  an  irregular  pigment
network,  blue-white  hue,  and  regres-
sion. Dermoscopy also helps in the iden-
tification of seborrheic keratoses, which
are characterized by milia-like cysts and
comedo-like openings,37 also referred to
as a “brain-like pattern.”

Beau Visage

A skin imaging and consultation system,
Beau  Visage  was  developed  especially
for  aesthetic  medicine  practitioners,
beauty clinics, and MediSpas (Fig. 38-5).
Beau  Visage  allows  the  aesthetician  to
view up to 2 mm beneath the surface of

commercially  available  devices  are  the
Vivascope  1000  and  the  newer  version
1500 (Lucid, Rochester, NY). The instru-
ment is a diode laser with a wavelength
of 830 nm and a 30(cid:13) objective lens, pro-
viding  a  high  resolution  for  visualizing
skin  morphology.  Epidermal  thickness
can be measured and keratinocytes iden-
tified  via  this  technique.  In  addition,
melanin  has  a  strong  “contrast,”29
providing information on pigment alter-
ation and melanocyte distribution in the
epidermis.  CLSM  has  been  used  in
various  applications  in  dermatology
such as for the evaluation of pigmented
lesions,30 melanoma31,32
and  non-
melanoma  skin  cancers,33,34 as  well  as

employs a sophisticated lens and several
flashes  and  filters  using  two  types  of
polarized  lights,  as  well  as  fluorescent
and ultraviolet lights. The system’s four
lights  include:  parallel-polarized  light,
which  highlights  fine  lines  and  pores;
cross-polarized light, which reveals red-
ness and irritation; blue light, which dis-
closes  the  presence  of  bacteria  and
clogged  pores;  and  an  ultraviolet  light,
which  shows  sun  damage.  The  images
are stored in the system, where they can
be easily retrieved when needed.

Canﬁeld Scientiﬁc Camera System

These  camera  systems  are  specifically
designed to meet the needs of the indi-
vidual physician using the camera. The
camera  system  has  an  adjustable  chin
rest  and  a  forehead  rest  with  a  fiber
optic guide light to ensure proper posi-
tioning  of  the  head  in  before  and  after
pictures.  This  is  necessary  to  ensure
that the before and after pictures are as
similar  as  possible,  with  the  only  vari-
able being the finding that is being pho-
tographed. Canfield systems come with
regular cameras and/or ultraviolet cam-
eras, and may also include digital cam-
eras and software that can measure dis-
tances  in  the  before  and  after  pictures.
This  software  is  useful,  for  example,
when studying the effects of botulinum
toxin on eyebrow shape and height.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy 

Confocal  Laser  Scanning  Microscopy

diode  laser  to  visualize  a  three-dimen-
sional image of skin from the SC of the
epidermis  to  the  papillary  dermis.  The

hand-held device is placed against the skin to produce an image used to measure extracellular matrix
content, melanin, and hemoglobin. The data are tracked in software that is designed to conduct cosmetic

the skin and to analyze the components
responsible for the way their client looks
and  ages,  such  as  blood,  melanin,  and
sun damage. It also allows for the calcu-
lation of skin age based on the health of
the  client’s  skin.  Beau  Visage  has  been
specifically designed to increase revenue
from client consultations and to rebook
clients for additional treatments. This is
a modular system, with add-on elements
including wrinkle analysis, spot collagen,
and spot dermal melanin. Beau Visage is
powered by SIAscopy, a technology that
is  used  globally  to  help  diagnose  skin
conditions as severe as skin cancer. The
Baumann  Visage  System  utilized  by
Beau Visage contains a module that will
help determine the Baumann Skin Type
(see Chapter 9).

Cosmetrics

Cosmetrics  allows  cosmetic  formula-
tors to test and accurately quantify the
effect  of  a  product  by  extracting  data
from live skin (Fig. 38-6). It was devel-
oped  as  a  cosmetic  trial  management
solution to the challenge faced by man-
ufacturers in the skin treatment/product
markets,  whose  consumers  increas-
ingly demand proof of product claims.
Cosmetrics  is  the  only  single  system

currently  available  that  can  visualize
and accurately measure living hemoglo-
bin, melanin, and collagen up to 2 mm
beneath the surface of the skin in vivo.
It is powered by SIAscopy™ (the same
system  that  powers  Beau  Visage),
which  is  a  patented  skin  visualization
and measurement technology that pro-
vides  a  view  of  the  structure  of  the
skin.38

SUMMARY

This is by no means an exhaustive list of
the skin bioengineering techniques that
are  available.  However,  these  methods
are  the  ones  most  commonly  referred
to  in  the  cosmetic  dermatology  litera-
ture. Most of these techniques are sim-
ple to use and will help physicians col-
lect  data  on  patients  that  will  help
various  practitioners  evaluate  the  effi-
cacy of the many new cosmetic proce-
dures  and  treatments  available  on  the
market.

Scales Used To
Classify Skin

Mari Paz Castanedo-Tardan, MD
Leslie Baumann, MD

Skin  type  classifications  are  not  only
important  in  patient  evaluation  and
treatment, but also play a key role in the
assessment  of  patients  in  clinical  trials.
Some  classifications  such  as  Fitzpatrick
skin  phototyping  are  mostly  used  for
treatment  plans  and  response.  Others,
on the other hand, are primarily used in
clinical studies to assess the severity of
the  cosmetic  disorder  and  evaluate  and
follow-up  the  treatment  response.  In
order to understand and assess the treat-
ment response, physicians greatly bene-
fit  from  the  use  of  structural  measure-
ment scales. Both types of classifications
will be discussed in this chapter.

FITZPATRICK CLASSIFICATION

Fitzpatrick  skin  classification  became
the  initial  skin  typing  system  when  it
was introduced in 1975 by Dr. Thomas
B. Fitzpatrick to measure skin sensitivity
to  ultraviolet  (UV)  light  (Table  39-1).  It
was  originally  designed  to  classify
patients  in  order  to  determine  the  cor-
rect dose of UV light for treating psoria-
sis.  Notably,  this  classification  was  not
intended to define skin color; rather, it is
based on patients’ skin responses to UV
light.  Although  not  an  indicator  of
patients’ ethnicity, it provides an idea of
subjects’ skin color and complexion. For
many years, Fitzpatrick’s skin classifica-
tion  was  the  predominant  skin  typing
system used in the literature. Currently,
dermatologists  use  this  classification
approach  for  planning  treatments  with

BAUMANN SKIN TYPE  
CLASSIFICATION 

The  Baumann  Skin  Typing  System  was
introduced in 2005 in the book The Skin
Type Solution (New York, Bantam 2005).
This  approach  to  classifying  skin  type
and tailoring corresponding treatments is
discussed at length in Chapter 9 and can
be  used  for  patients  regardless  of  their
age,  gender,  or  ethnicity.  It  is  based  on
evaluating  the  skin  according  to  four
major parameters: oily versus dry (O/D),
sensitive  versus  resistant  (S/R),  pig-
mented versus nonpigmented (P/N), and
wrinkled  versus  tight  (W/T).  To  obtain
one’s four-letter skin type code, patients
take  a  self-administered  questionnaire
known  as  the  Baumann  Skin  Type
Indicator (BSTI), which provides a score
correlating  with  an  individual’s  prevail-
ing cutaneous tendencies along the four
descriptive  spectra.  The  various  permu-
tations  of  the  four  parameters  yield  16
different  skin  types  (Table  39-2).  The
questionnaire to determine Baumann Skin
Type can be found at www.skinIQ.com

SKIN SENSITIVITY
Acne Quality of Life Scale

The  psychosocial  effects  of  acne  are
very well known among dermatologists

(see  Chapters  15  and  40).  The  Acne-
Specific  Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire
(Acne-QoL) was specifically designed to
assess the psychologic impact of acne on
patients  affected  with  this  condition.1
The  test  contains  19  questions  in  four
major  categories:  self-perception,  role-
social,  role-emotional,  and  acne  symp-
toms  (Table  39-3).  The  questions  are
asked  about  the  patient’s  feelings  and
concerns within the “last week” prior to
the  questionnaire.  The
answering 
answers  are  assessed  on  a  seven-point
scale  ranging  from  “0”  correlating  with
“extremely” or “extensive” to “6” repre-
senting “not at all” or “none.” The values
are  then  totaled,  with  a  higher  score
indicating  a  better  quality  of  life.  This
system provides physicians with a uni-
versal  approach  to  assessing  patients
with psychosocial impacts of acne both
in clinical practice and trials.

PIGMENTATION
The Melasma Area and 
Severity Index

The  Melasma  Area  and  Severity  Index
(MASI)  was  introduced  by  Kimbrough-
Green et al. to quantify the severity and
treatment  response  in  patients  with
melasma  (Fig.  39-1).  The  MASI  score
evaluates facial skin based on three vari-
ables: area (A) of involvement, darkness
(D) of melasma, and homogeneity (H) of
hyperpigmentation (Table 39-4A).

Taylor Hyperpigmentation Scale

The Taylor Hyperpigmentation Scale is a
visual scale introduced by Taylor et al. in
2005.2 This assessment is composed of 15
colored plastic cards that are applicable to
Fitzpatrick  skin  classification  types  I  to
VI. Each card has 10 progressively darker
bands  of  skin  color  gradations,  demon-
strating the increasing level of hyperpig-
mentation. The combination of 15 cards
each  with  10  increasingly  darker  bands
provides  the  dermatologist  with  a  wide
range of skin hues by which to render an
evaluation. This system is an inexpensive
and effective approach to patient follow-
up  and  assessment  of 
treatment
response. However, there is a significant
intra-  and  interindividual  difference  of
grading  among  the  investigators2 (see
Figure 14-1 in Chapter 14).

WRINKLES AND PHOTOAGING
SCALES

TABLE 39-5
Glogau Photoaging Classiﬁcation

Glogau Photoaging Classiﬁcation

The  Glogau  Classification,  known  in
the  lay  media  as  “The  Wrinkle  Scale,”
was  designed  for  the  assessment  of
generalized  facial  photoaging.  It  is
based on four major criteria consisting
of  no  wrinkles  (Type  I),  wrinkles  in
motion  (Type  II),  wrinkles  at  rest 
(Type III), and only wrinkles (Type IV) 
(Table 39-5).

Fitzpatrick’s Classiﬁcation of Facial
Wrinkling (Perioral and Periorbital)

Dr. Richard E. Fitzpatrick’s classification
of  facial  wrinkling  is  directed  toward
skin elasticity and generalized wrinkling
and was designed for perioral and peri-
orbital rhytides (Table 39-6). It was orig-
inally  designed  for  establishing  the
effects  of  laser  resurfacing  of  wrinkled
skin.

Hamilton Scale

Hamilton  described  a  classification  of
contour  changes  of  facial  skin.  It  is
based  on  four  variables:  clinical  mor-
phology  (laxity,  furrows,  or  wrinkles);
tissue location (muscular, musculocuta-
neous,  or  cutaneous);  clinical  location
(cheeks,  neck,  eyelids,  forehead,  etc.);
and  etiology  (genetic,  repeated  facial
expression,  or  photoaging).  Each  type
of  change  is  then  presented  with  a
proper  procedural  treatment,  such  as
rhytidectomy,  soft  tissue  augmenta-
tion, resurfacing with lasers or chemical
peels,  or  a  combined  approach  (Tables
39-7A and B).

Lemperle Scale

The  Lemperle  Scale 
is  another
approach  to  assessing  facial  wrinkles3

TYPE I 
NO WRINKLES

Usually ages 

20s–30s

Early photoaging

Mild pigmentary 
changes
No keratoses

Minimal wrinkles

TYPE II 
WRINKLES IN MOTION

Usually ages late 
30s–40s

Early to moderate 
photoaging

Early senile lentigines

Palpable but not 

visible keratoses
Parallel smile lines

beginning to appear 
lateral to mouth.

TYPE III 
WRINKLES AT REST

Usually age 

50 or older

Advanced photoaging

Obvious dyschromias,
telangiectasias
Visible keratoses

Persistent wrinkling

TYPE IV
ONLY WRINKLES

Usually age 

60 or above
Severe photoaging 

Yellow-gray skin

Prior skin

(Table 39-8). It was originally designed
to  evaluate  treatment  response  with
injectable  fillers.  This  classification
addresses specific wrinkles on different
areas.  The  wrinkles
anatomical 
assessed  on  this  scale  are  horizontal
forehead furrows, glabellar frown lines,
periorbital  lines,  periauricular  lines,
cheek  lines,  nasolabial  folds,  radial
upper  lip  lines,  radial  lower  lines,  cor-
ner  of  the  mouth  lines,  marionette
lines, the labiomental crease, and hori-
zontal neck folds.

Larnier Photographic Scale

The  Larnier  Photographic  Scale  was
designed  to  rate  photoaging  of  skin
based on photographs.4 It is a six-point
photographic scale, with each point con-
sisting of three separate photos to illus-
trate  each  level  of  severity.  Therefore,
the  scale  consists  of  six  grades  of  pho-
toaging  severity,  with  grade  1  corre-
sponding  to  mild  and  grade  6  to  very
severe. Larnier’s scale has been validated
for assessing photodamage in Caucasian
subjects, but not other ethnic groups.

comes of cosmetic procedures. The grad-
ing is defined as absent, mild, moderate,
severe, and extreme, corresponding with
grades 1 to 5, respectively. 

Grifﬁth’s Photonumeric Scale

This  is  a  nine-point  photonumeric
scale for assessing facial photodamage.

It  is  illustrated  by  five  sets  of  pho-
tographs depicting five of the nine scal-
ing grades (0–8), with the odd number
grading points not illustrated. Each set
consists  of  two  photographs  (en  face
and  40-degree  oblique).  They  are
graded  as  0,  2,  4,  6,  and  8,  correlating
with no damage, mild, moderate, mod-
erate/severe,  and  severe  damage,
respectively.6

used  to  grade  the  aging  of  the  skin  of
men  and  women.7 Volume  1  covers
what 
to  as
Caucasian  type  skin.  These  photos  are
useful  in  both  the  research  and  clinical
settings  to  evaluate  the  performance
of the  actions  undertaken;  compare
the effects  of  different  products  and
treatments; and measure their effective-
ness, using a standardized visual evalua-
tion criterion. A few examples appear in
Figs. 39-2 and 39-3.

SUMMARY

There are several scales available in the
practice of cosmetic dermatology for the
purposes  of  classifying  and  evaluating
the  skin  prior  to  and  after  ameliorative
procedures. The ideal scale is uncompli-
cated,  easy  to  use,  and  reliable  with
well-defined  categories.  An  ideal  scale
should  also  be  reliable  for  use  in  daily
practice  in  addition  to  clinical  trials.
Finally, the best scales are intelligible to
patients,  as  patients  prefer  and  benefit
from  understanding  and  following  the
scaling  system,  allowing  them  to  feel

more  involved  in  their  treatment  plan
and progress.

The Psychosocial
Aspects of Cosmetic
Dermatology

Edmund Weisberg, MS

In  an  ideal  world,  people  would  base
their  sense  of  self-esteem  only  on  the
content  of  their  character  and  not  their
outward appearance; there would be no
discernible  disparity  in  hiring  rates
among  those  considered  attractive  and
those  deemed  unattractive;  and  the  cul-
tural  emphasis  on  or  obsession  with
beauty  would  be  relegated  to  a  level  of
focus  much  closer  to  its  actual  impor-
tance. Needless to say, we do not live in
an ideal world. Certainly, there is ample
evidence  to  suggest  that  across  a  wide
swathe  of  the  population,  one’s  own
appearance is important on the individual
level  and  has  wider  social  implications.
The American Society of Plastic Surgery
reports  that  nearly  11  million  cosmetic
procedures (comprising cosmetic surgery
and  minimally-invasive  but  not  recon-
structive procedures) were performed by
board-certified  physicians  in  the  United
States in 2006, which represented a 7%
increase  over  the  previous  year,  and  a
48%  increase  from  2000.  In  turn,  the
2005  total  represented  a  151%  increase
from  2000  and  a  775%  increase  from
1992 (the first year for which the 76-year-
old  organization  has  detailed  statistics).
In 2006, Botox injections, chemical peels,
laser  hair  removal,  microdermabrasion,
and hyaluronic acid, in descending order,
were the five most popular procedures.1
In total, soft tissue filler procedures (also
including calcium hydroxylapatite, colla-
gen,  fat,  and  polylactic  acid)  collectively
represented  the  second  most  popular
type of procedure. The top five cosmetic
surgical  procedures,  also  in  descending
order,  were  breast  augmentation,  nose
reshaping,  liposuction,  eyelid  surgery,
and  tummy  tuck.  According  to  psychi-
atric  studies,  the  number  of  “healthy”
people  seeking  aesthetic  surgery  has
increased  steadily  since  1980,  indicating
greater public acceptance, wider diversity
in  those  seeking  the  procedures,  and  an
evolution in the psychiatric definition of
“healthy.”2

As with most of the topics covered in
this text, a full book could be devoted to
the  psychosocial  aspects  of  cosmetic

dermatology  and,  in  particular,  the  bil-
lion-dollar beauty industry as well as the
historic,  philosophic,  and  theoretical
investigation of beauty itself. This chap-
ter  will  discuss  some  of  the  underlying
reasons for the ever-increasing incidence
of  elective  aesthetic  procedures  in  the
developed  world  and  what  motivates
people  to  undergo  these  procedures.
Specifically,  this  chapter  will  focus  on
the influence and significance of beauty
in  society  and  its  implications  for  the
field of cosmetic dermatology. The sig-
nificant social and psychic consequences
that  disorders  such  as  psoriasis,  alope-
cia,  hirsutism,  melasma, 
rosacea,
vitiligo, and others have on individual’s
health-related  quality  of  life  are  gener-
ally  beyond  the  scope  of  this  chapter,
though  such  effects  related  to  acne  are
briefly considered as is the role of stress
as  an  initiating  or  mediating  factor  in
cutaneous conditions that may, in turn,
induce anxiety over the effects on one’s
skin,  fostering  the  desire  for  remedial
cosmetic treatment.

THE VIEW OF EVOLUTIONARY 
PSYCHOLOGY: PULCHRITUDE 
TO THE MULTITUDE

In the United States, more than twice as
much  money  is  spent  on  personal  care
than on reading material. In 2000, North
America  represented  30%  of  the  market
of  the  45  billion-dollar  global  cosmetics
industry  with  Europe
and  toiletries 
accounting for 34.9%, Japan, 18.9%, and
other countries comprising the remaining
16.2%.3 Since  then,  the  industry  has  at
least trebled, with US $150 billion earned
in 2004.4 According to Global Cosmetics
and Toiletries 2006, the United States and
Japan are the top two individual markets,
with  China  recently  moving  into  third
place  ahead  of  France  and  Germany.5 In
addition to China, Russia, Argentina, and
Brazil  have  shown  high  rates  of  recent
growth  in  the  cosmetics  and  toiletries
market.4 Although  expendable  income
seems  an  integral  part  of  the  consumer
equation, plenty of money is spent on cos-
metics  in  the  developing  world  as  well.
For  instance,  for  at  least  the  last  decade,
there have been more Avon ladies in Brazil
than  there  are  members  of  the  military,
with Avon ladies now outnumbering mil-
itary  personnel  1    million  +  to  ~400,000
(Personal  communication  with 
the
Brazilian  Embassy.  3006  Massachusetts
Avenue: Washington, DC; 2008).6–8

The  usage  of  personal  care  or 
“cosmetic”  products  dates  back  at  least
40,000  years,  suggesting  a  lengthy  his-
tory  of  human  fascination  and  concern
with appearance.3,9 In fact, through the
thousands  of  years  of  recorded  human
history, concepts of beauty have contin-
ually  evolved  and,  in  the  modern  age,
come under close scientific scrutiny.

Evolutionary psychology purports to
explain  the  human  interest  in  and
attraction to beauty. Although there has
long been an aversion among academics
to  seriously  investigate  the  subject  of
beauty, an explosion of research in the
last  three  decades  has  challenged  the
assumption  that  beauty  is  merely  an
arbitrary cultural concoction.10 Regardless
of  ethnic  origin  of  the  observer  or  the
object  of  observation,  studies  across
culture  have  shown  a  consistent  basis
for ascribing beauty.11 In fact, numerous
researchers now believe that while cul-
ture  and  individual  history  may  influ-
ence assessments of human beauty, the
general  geometric  facial  features  that
form the perception of beauty might be
universal.12 Further, there is widespread
support for the theory that such a uni-
versal standard for facial beauty follows
the divine proportion (1:1.618),13 which
is also known as the golden ratio among
several  other  expressions,  and  is  also
applied  to  overall  human  dimensions,
additional  forms  in  nature,  as  well  as
manifestations  of  human  creativity,
particularly  architecture  (Figs.  40-1,

FACE VALUE

Though other areas are treated, the face
is  the  primary  locus  for  minimally-
invasive cosmetic procedures performed
by dermatologists and plastic surgeons,
as  well  as  a  frequent  cite  for  cosmetic
surgical procedures. Given that the face
is the most frequently and prominently
displayed  bodily  area,  it  is  reasonable
that greater anxiety and concern would
be focused on facial appearance.

The  importance  of  the  face  and  the
frequency at which parts of the face rep-
resent  the  primary  treatment  site  are  a
given in cosmetic practices. But is there
one  ideal  that  physicians  should  envi-
sion or use as a model when working to
cosmetically  improve  a  patient’s  face?
Research  has  suggested  that  there  just
might be such a paragon of facial beauty.
Classical  musings  on  beauty  from  pre-
Socratic  philosophers  onward  to  the
present  day  appear  to  contain  a  com-
mon thread. In fact, these theories have
converged  on  clarity,  symmetry,  har-
mony, and vivid color as important char-
acteristics  that  impart  beauty.16 Ideal
proportions of the face are viewed even
more  specifically  by  plastic  surgeons
(Fig. 40-4). Overall, more recent research
has  also  revealed  averageness,  sexual
dimorphism,  and  youthfulness  along
with  symmetry  to  be  significant  deter-
minants  of  attractiveness.17 A  provoca-
tive analysis by Langlois et al. found that
subjects both within and across cultures
agreed regarding those who are and are
not  attractive.18 Rhodes  et  al.,  working
with Chinese and Japanese study partic-
ipants,  have  also  demonstrated  that

40-2,  and 40-3A&B).  The  argument  of
evolutionary  psychology  is  that  beauty
is  a  biologic  adaptation,  a  species-wide
aspect of the human condition that elic-
its pleasure, compels attention, and pro-
pels activity that leads to the continua-
tion of the gene pool. Natural selection,
so the theory goes, has molded human
brain  circuitry  to  appreciate  smooth
skin, thick shiny hair, curved waists, and
symmetric  bodies  because  the  people
who,  through  evolution,  responded  to
these  signals  had  more  reproductive
success.14 Etcoff  suggests  in  her  book
Survival  of  the  Prettiest that  the  human
response  to  beauty  is  automatic  even
though  thoughts  and  behavior  are
within conscious control. Further, Olson
and  Marshuetz  have  shown  that  facial
attractiveness  is  assessed  quickly  based
on few visual cues, which makes beauty
difficult  to  ignore,  they  conclude,  and
may explain the significant social status
of  beauty.15 The  following  discussion
focuses on the human definitions of and
responses  to  beauty,  particularly  the
concept of facial appearance, attractive-

faces  with  visual  age  signals  as  com-
pared  to  women  born  to  parents
younger than 30 years of age. Mother’s
age, but not the father’s age, influenced
men’s  attraction  to  particular  female
faces only when long-term relationships
were considered. Humans with no pre-
conceived notions and little or no envi-
ronmental  influence,  in  other  words,
babies, are perhaps the most instructive
on  this  subject.  In  a  study  by  Langlois,
hundreds of slides of people’s faces from
a diverse population were collected and
shown to adults who were asked to rate
the attractiveness of the individuals. The
same  slides  were  then  shown  to 
6-month-old  babies  who  stared  signifi-
cantly longer at the same faces that the
adults  found  most  attractive.26 These
results  suggest  that  babies  can  distin-
guish beauty and that human faces may
possess  universal  features  of  beauty
across different racial and individual fea-
tures.27 It is important to note that rela-
tive  beauty  does  not  affect  how  babies
feel  or  interact  toward  their  caregivers;
this  study  dealt  only  with  reactions  to
unfamiliar  faces.  A  more  recent  study
demonstrated  that  6-month-old  infants
categorized pictures of female faces into
attractive  and  unattractive  groups,
which  the  investigators  suggest  may
reveal the foundation for the “beauty is
good” stereotype.28

Infants have also been shown to pre-
fer looking at symmetric as opposed to
asymmetric  patterns.  A  study  of
monozygotic twins who are genetically
but  not  developmentally 
identical
revealed  that  participants  consistently
selected the more symmetric twin of the
pair  as  more  attractive.29 In  addition,
female  facial  attractiveness  as  deter-
mined by male judges has been found to
be  best  exemplified  by  symmetry  and
averageness  as  well  as  features  such  as
thin  eyebrows,  large  eyes,  small  nose,
salient  cheekbones,  thick  lips,  and  a
small  chin.30 These  findings  demon-
strate  that  symmetry  of  the  face  is  sig-
nificant in the perception of beauty.

Of course, the majority of people do
not  have  symmetric  faces.  In  fact,  it
appears  that  natural  asymmetry  is  an
evolutionary  adaptation.  In  one  study
by  Zaidel  et  al.,  the  investigators
selected  straight  head-on  pictures  of
professional  models  and  obtained
beauty  ratings  of  these  photographs
from one group of subjects.31 A different
group  of  participants  were  shown 
left-left and right-right composites along
with the original pictures, with significant
differences  in  the  ratings  between  the
original  and  the  symmetric  composites

preferences  for  facial  averageness  and
symmetry  are  not  limited  to  Western
cultures,  buttressing  the  theory  that
such perceptions are based in biology.19
Therefore,  the  “ideal  face”  may be  con-
sidered  ideal  in  any  and  every  culture.
This  is  important  for  the  cosmetic 
dermatologist  because  the  techniques
used  in  one  country  and  culture  would
be applicable in other cultures as well.

Despite the identification of universal
notions  of  attractiveness,  variations
across cultures and among individuals in
the perceptions of beauty, as well as in
the  particular  target  areas  for  enhance-
ment, do persist, however. For example,
a  recent  survey  study  of  50  Korean
women  and  50 
Japanese  women
revealed  that  Korean  women  sought  a
larger fold parallel to the lid margin and
epicanthal  fold  elimination,  whereas
Japanese  women  were  primarily  inter-
ested in thinner lips and generally more
delicate  facial  characteristics.20 Further-
more, not all theorists agree that a uni-
versal  beauty  ideal  exists.  Armstrong
contended  that  no  single  principle  can
adequately  explain  the  concept  of
beauty.21 Hönekopp  bucks  the  near-
consensus  even  further  by  suggesting
that the data that have led to the support
and promulgation of universal standards
of  attractiveness  have  been  misinter-
preted and that, in fact, private taste is as
potent as shared taste in terms of facial

attractiveness  perceptions.22 On  the
other  hand,  Rubenstein  argues  that
because different standards are employed
to  evaluate  dynamic  versus  static  faces
and  perceived  emotion  may  play  a
greater role in assessing attractiveness in
dynamic  faces  compared  with  static
faces, a deeper understanding of the fac-
tors  involved  in  the  human  perception
of 
facial  attractiveness  might  be
achieved  by  more  fully  exploring  the
differences between dynamic and static
faces.23 Rhodes  suggests  that  no  gold
standard for facial beauty prevails, pos-
sibly because of variable interpretations
of  “attractiveness”  among  those  sur-
veyed on the topic.24 She does acknowl-
edge averageness, symmetry, and sexual
dimorphism  as  significant  components
of  biologically  based  preferences,  how-
ever. Such qualities can serve as impor-
tant  guidelines  for  patients  as  well  as
practitioners  regardless  of  whether  one
clings to the dominant view of a univer-
sal beauty ideal.

It has been argued that the perception
of  beauty  is  a  learned  behavior  depen-
dent on the environment in which one is
raised rather than an inherent ability to
perceive  beauty.  Indeed,  Perrett  et  al.
have shown that the learning of parental
characteristics can influence perceptions
of  facial  attractiveness.25 In  their  study,
women  born  to  parents  older  than  30
years of age were more attracted to male

 
 
 
 
 
 
indicating to the authors that functional
asymmetry  can  occur  within  faces  that
are deemed beautiful. Recently, in a dif-
ferent study, Zaidel and other colleagues
found an association between symmetry
and health, but not a strong relationship
between symmetry and attractiveness.32
The  researchers  concluded  that  facial
symmetry  may  be  a  potent  factor  in
conveying health but is not essential in
communicating attractiveness. If desired,
asymmetric features can often be easily
remedied by the adept cosmetic derma-
tologist  or  plastic  surgeon,  however
(Fig. 40-4).

As implied above, facial symmetry is
not the only important facial character-
istic that factors into the human percep-
tion of a beautiful visage. Baby faces in
general trigger tender emotions in adults
who  find  the  soft  skin  and  hair,  large
eyes  and  pupils,  fat  cheeks,  and  small
noses  irresistible.33 Etcoff  asserts  that
this  is  another  useful  adaptation  since
defenseless  infants  must  arouse  nurtur-
ing behavior from adults on whom they
are  dependent  for  sustenance.  These
“baby face” facial features are often irre-
sistible in adult faces as are slightly fem-
inized faces. In a cross-cultural study of
Japanese  and  Scottish  subjects,  partici-
pants  preferred  feminized  shapes  for
both female and male faces, which may
indicate  a  selection  pressure  limiting
sexual  dimorphism  and  promoting
neoteny.34 In  a  recent  study  of  400
British men and women asked to judge
pictures  of  male  faces  (excluding  hair,
ears,  neck,  shoulders,  etc.)  digitally
altered  to  appear  more  masculine  or
more  feminine,  women,  on  average,
associated the more feminine faces with
warmer,  more  faithful,  and  better  par-
enting  personalities,  as  well  as  better
mate  options.35 This  study  appears  to
reinforce previous work by Rhodes et al.
as  well  as  the  above  work  by  Perrett 
et  al.  that  found  feminized  faces  to  be
preferred  over  average  or  masculinized
faces.36 The  fact  that  babies  and  adults
appear  to  find  the  same  facial  features
attractive  is  compelling  evidence  point-
ing toward the biologic adaptation argu-
ment.  Anthropologists  have  contended
that  facial  preferences  for  attractive
traits  may 
indeed  be  adaptations
because such traits may indicate impor-
tant qualities in the mate, such as health.
Does this mean that dermatologists and
plastic  surgeons  should  strive  toward
the  universally  admired  geometric  fea-
tures? If  so,  what  are  the  implications
for those patients whose features cannot
quite  meet  the  ideal? If  such  universal
standards exist, do they exert significant

pressure on people to correct perceived
imperfections? Or  is  the  race  against
time the primary motivator behind cos-
metic procedures?

The  popularity  of  the  billion-dollar
cosmetics and toiletries industry as well
as that of cosmetic procedures suggests
that  the  seemingly  relentless  barrage  of
beauty ideals can influence people across
various demographic spectra. The perva-
siveness  of  media  images  of  attractive-
ness has been shown, in fact, to exert a
negative impact on women’s self-percep-
tions,  particularly  the  facial  satisfaction
levels of women who are already sensi-
tive  about  their  appearance.37 Such
media exposure certainly contributes to
the  continually  escalating  drive  to  alter
one’s appearance. Further, the particular
images  held  up  as  iconic  examples  of
beauty,  along  with  their  ubiquity,  may
even negatively affect those already con-
sidered  attractive.  In  a  study  of  203
young women, researchers rated partici-
pants  on  facial  attractiveness  and
obtained subjects’ self-reports on perfec-
tionism, weight preoccupation, and neu-
roticism.38 After  controlling  for  body
size and neurotic perfectionism, investi-
gators  found  attractiveness  and  weight
preoccupation  to  be  positively  related,
suggesting that facial beauty may pose a
risk for the development of eating disor-
ders.38 Obviously,  some  attractive  peo-
ple  yearn  and  strive  to  be  perceived  as
even more attractive. It is important for
the  cosmetic  dermatologist  to  be  cog-
nizant of this phenomenon because it is
not unusual for patients to request a cos-
metic  procedure  that  is  not  only  inap-
propriate for them but could actually do
them  harm.  An  example  of  this  is  a
young  woman  in  the  primary  author’s
practice who wanted CO2 laser resurfac-
ing  for  her  30th  birthday.  This  patient
was counseled and treated with a topical
retinoid  that  resolved  the  imperfection
with much less risk.

BODY IMAGE

Eleanor  Roosevelt  once  said,  “No  one
can make you feel inferior without your
consent.”39 Some would have us believe
that the cosmetics and toiletries industry
makes  a  valiant  attempt.  In  fact,  there
are  those  who  would  characterize  the
advertising  of  the  billion-dollar  beauty
industry as an outright assault. Although
a near-consensus regarding beauty stan-
dards seems to have emerged, the judg-
ment of attraction is heavily influenced
by mass media, art, literature, television,
movies, and other media.40 Unless one is

able  to  steadfastly  avoid  television,  the
Internet, billboards, bus advertisements,
magazines,  and  the  like,  it  is  virtually
impossible not to encounter the plethora
of  beauty  images  virtually  omnipresent
in our culture today. Scanning the maga-
zine racks, paying attention to advertise-
ments,  and  watching  television  can
leave  a  person  feeling  bombarded  with
what  society  seems  to  deem  the  ideal
images of a healthy, beautiful person.

Through  art  history,  beginning  with
the  classical  images  of  beauty,  particu-
larly  female  beauty,  as  depicted  in
ancient times, through the Medieval and
Baroque  periods,  especially  the  gener-
ously-proportioned  figures  painted  by
Peter Paul Rubens, the Renaissance and
on  into  contemporary  times,  it  is  clear
that beauty ideals wax and wane. This is
more patently clear when one considers
the apparent changes in modern female
iconography as represented by so-called
supermodels,  pin-up  models,  or  center-
folds. Larger, more curvaceous women,
such  as  Marilyn  Monroe  and  Jayne
Mansfield, were considered ideal a half
century ago, while considerably thinner
models,  such  as  Kate  Moss,  are  more
typical  now.  Changes  have  also  been
noted  and  quantified  regarding  center-
folds during the last half century.

A recent study by Seifert that consid-
ered  the  height,  weight,  breast,  waist,
and  hip  measurements  of  559  Playboy
centerfold models over the last 50 years
revealed  a  subtle,  gradual  trend  toward
slimness,  with  very  thin  models  rarely
seen  until  this  century.41 Greater  speci-
ficity was achieved in a fascinating study
that  included  economic  conditions  as  a
variable in facial and body feature prefer-
ences. Pettijohn and Jungeberg explored
the relationships of United States social
and economic factors to facial and body
characteristics  of  Playboy Playmates  of
the Year from 1960 to 2000. They found
that  older,  heavier,  taller  models  with  a
larger  waist  and  waist-to-hip  ratio,
smaller bust-to-waist ratio, smaller body
mass index (BMI), and smaller eyes were
chosen  during  periods  when  social  and
economic  conditions  were  measurably
difficult,  and  concluded  that  environ-
mental security conditions can influence
perceptions of attractiveness.42

In a broader study considering ideal-
ized female body images represented by
Playboy Playmates  of  the  Year,  Miss
America Pageant winners, fashion mod-
els, and young women in general span-
ning  eight  decades,  Byrd-Bredbenner 
et  al.  reported  that  the  general  trend  in
all  groups  changed  from  a  less  curva-
ceous  figure  during  the  early  20th  cen-

tury to a more curvaceous shape by mid-
century,  returning  to  a  less  curvaceous
body by the end of the century. In addi-
tion, they found a significant decline in
BMI  in  the  idealized  groups  over  time,
with  an  opposite  trend 
in  young
women,  and  a  markedly  wider  diver-
gence between the typical body sizes of
young women and the idealized images
depicted in the media.43 A smaller previ-
ous  study  by  Katzmaryzyk  and  Davis
that  considered  the  changes  in  body
weight and shape of 240 Playboy center-
folds from 1978 to 1998, a cohort tacitly
understood  as  “ideal,”  found  that  70%
of the models were underweight, which
underscores  the  nature  of  the  social
pressures for thinness that women face
and helps to explain their body dissatis-
faction  and  increased  risks  for  eating 
disorders.44

Currently,  the  idealized  female  pro-
file is tall and thin but sporting an hour-
glass  figure,  large  eyes,  prominent
cheek bones, and large forehead. Other
features  associated  with  attractiveness
for females include a smaller than aver-
age chin, smaller than average nose, and
higher  than  average  forehead.45 The
typical male image is also tall, muscular
with  little  body  fat,  and  features  large
eyes,  prominent  cheekbones,  and  a
large  chin.46 When  juxtaposed,  the
female  has  lighter  hair  than  the  male,
who  typically  has  dark  hair,  to  match
documented  preferences.40 However,
negative  self-esteem  or  body  image
effects  on  both  women  and  men  are
seen more often as increasingly narrow
and  nearly  unattainable  gender  stereo-
types are emphasized with ideal images
of physical beauty.47

Although  women  have  long  been
described as victims of this onslaught of
idealized  images  of  feminine  beauty,
there is evidence to suggest that men are
even starting to feel the implied pressure
of such masculine imagery. Purchases of
fitness equipment and even pectoral and
other  implants  may  very  well  be  mani-
festations of Western cultural norms for
presentations of the ideal male body that
are growing increasingly muscular.48 It is
generally  accepted  that  men  spend  sig-
nificantly  more  money  now  than  10  to
15  years  ago  on  aesthetic  surgery,  cos-
metics, fitness equipment, and hair prod-
ucts, including dyes, weaves, and trans-
plants. Nevertheless, 90% of the patients
who  underwent  cosmetic  surgery  or
minimally-invasive  procedures  in  2006,
as  tracked  by  the  American  Society  of
Plastic Surgeons (which measures proce-
dures performed by physicians of all dis-
ciplines),  were  women.1 This  suggests

that women remain more drastically and
measurably influenced by beautification
pressures. In a study of 246 medical stu-
dents in Austria, answers to a question-
naire  on  weight  and  attitudes  toward
personal  body  weight  indicated  that
both  men  and  women,  but  women  in
particular,  characterize  their  weight
according  to  current  beauty  ideals  as
the  BMI  definition.49
opposed 
Researchers  observed  significant  body
dissatisfaction  among  women,  much
more  than  among  men,  and  concluded
that the females in the study group were
more  profoundly  influenced  by  current
ideals of slenderness.

to 

Further  evidence  of  the  effects  of
body image on individual self-esteem is
found  from  a  study  by  Pinhas  et  al.  in
which  51  female  subjects  were  shown
slides of fashion models and 67 control
subjects  were  shown  slides  with  no
human  figures.  The  researchers  found
that  the  study  group  members  were
more  depressed  and  angry  following
exposure to the slides of female fashion
models,  indicating  that  such  images
have  an  immediate  negative  impact  on
women’s  moods.50 These  findings  are
particularly  noteworthy  because  body
dissatisfaction  is  considered  a  potent
risk for the development of eating disor-
ders and can contribute to depression. A
more recent meta-analysis also supports
these  results  regarding  female  body
image. In considering data from 25 stud-
ies,  Groesz  et  al.  observed  that  body
image  of  female  subjects  was  signifi-
cantly  worse  after  subjects  saw  media
images  of  thin  women  as  compared  to
average-size  models,  plus-size  models,
or inanimate objects.51

Although  the  beauty  industry  is  fre-
quently blamed for stimulating women’s
desire  to  appear  younger  and  more
attractive,  the  industry  itself  might  not
be culpable. Instead, these longings may
be a reflection of preferences hard-wired
into human brain circuitry through evo-
lution.  The  billion-dollar  beauty  indus-
try  exists  because  women  want  to
attract men, and men are often attracted
to  younger  women.  Etcoff  argues  that
this  attraction  has  occurred  because  of
evolutionary  pressure.  Men  remain
attracted  to  nulliparous  women  who
abundantly  exhibit  signs  of  fertility
because this leads to propagation of the
species.52 The  beauty  industry,  repre-
sented  by  the  physical  fitness  branch,
aesthetic 
cosmetics,  and
advances  in  beauty  technology,  allows
people  to  indulge  in  the  illusion  of  an
extended youth and continued member-
ship in the visually preferred age group.

surgery, 

Nevertheless,  the  advertising  branch
of the business might still be presenting
a skewed view of what most people find
desirable  or  acceptable.  In  a  study  on
acceptable body sizes, 303 children, 427
adolescents,  261  young  adults,  and  326
middle-aged adults were shown several
line drawings of human figures ranging
in  age  grouping  and  size.53 Participants
were instructed to evaluate sets of draw-
ings  that  were  divided  by  age  group—
infant,  children,  young  adult,  middle-
aged  adult,  and  older  adults.  Each
subject  group  preferred  similar  ideal
body  sizes  across  all  arrays,  choosing
the midrange of fatness, and eschewing
both the obese and very thin body sizes.
Although a medically healthy range for a
particular height for adults would trans-
late to four or five of the nine body sizes
depicted  in  the  study,  participants
demonstrated acceptance for an average
of three or fewer body sizes. This sug-
gests that the ideal imagery exhibited in
various  media  may  filter  into  people’s
internal  ideations  and  that  midrange
models might better reflect what people
typically  find  acceptable  or  desirable.
Further,  very  different  images  of  the
ideal  body  form  continue  to  exist  in
non-Western  cultures  such  as  the  Inuit,
Maori,  Tibetans,  and  Bushmen  of  the
Kalahari Desert.54

The  notion  of  the  power  of  visual
media is reinforced by a study on body
dissatisfaction and abnormal eating atti-
tudes among congenitally blind women,
women  who  were  blinded  later  in  life,
and  sighted  women.  Baker  et  al.  found
that  congenitally  blind  women  had  the
lowest  body  dissatisfaction  scores  and
the most positive eating attitudes while
sighted  women  exhibited  the  highest
level  of  body  dissatisfaction  and  the
most  negative  eating  attitudes.55 The
external pressures exerted on the psyche
are  inestimable  and  provide  an  impor-
tant  backdrop  for  consultation  with  a
physician prior to any decision for cos-
metic alteration.

BODY DYSMORPHIC DISORDER

in 

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psy-
chiatric  condition  defined 
the
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of
Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) as a preoc-
cupation  with  an  imagined  defect  in
appearance.56 The  preoccupation  causes
impairment  in  social,  occupational,  or
other important areas of functioning. BDD
is  frequently  associated  with  significant
psychologic distress and may lead to suici-
dal ideation and suicide attempts.57 In fact,

a study in the British Journal of Dermatology
reported  that  most  dermatology  patients
who  committed  suicide  had  acne  or
BDD.58 BDD  often  leads  to  unnecessary
cosmetic procedures. The most common
areas  that  concern  these  patients  are  the
skin, hair, and nose.59 For several obvious
reasons,  it  is  important  for  the  cosmetic
dermatologist  or  plastic  surgeon  to  iden-
tify these patients during history and pre-
screening.  BDD  can  lead  to  significant
morbidity as well as a disproportionately
high number of risks for unnecessary pro-
cedures. In addition, these patients can be
difficult to treat because they are often dis-
satisfied  with  the  outcomes  of  the  treat-
ments they do receive.60,61

Phillips  et  al.  screened  268  patients
from two different environments: a gen-
eral dermatology outpatient practice in a
community  setting  and  a  dermatologic
cosmetic surgery outpatient practice at a
university  teaching  hospital.59 They
found  that  11.9%  of  patients  screened
positive  for  BDD.  Interestingly,  the
patients treated in the cosmetic surgery
practice  had  a  lower  rate  of  BDD
(10.0%)  than  did  those  in  the  general
dermatology practice (14.4%); however,
one-third of eligible subjects in the cos-
metic  practice  refused  to  complete  the
questionnaire.  This  may  have  affected
the  study  results,  which  also  revealed
that BDD is as common in men as it is in
women.  In  an  investigation  of  female
college students’ body images as well as
their experiences and attitudes regarding
cosmetic  surgery,  Sarwer  et  al.  found
that  two-thirds  of  the  559  participants
surveyed  knew  someone  who  had
received cosmetic surgery (with approx-
imately one-third reporting that a family
member  had  undergone  surgery),  5%
had  undergone  cosmetic  surgery  them-
selves,  and  2.5%  screened  positive  for
BDD.62 Cosmetic  dermatologists  and
plastic surgeons should be aware of the
possibility that this syndrome is affect-
ing some patients and should encourage
such  patients  to  receive  psychiatric
help.  BDD  can  be  successfully  treated
with  serotonergic  antidepressants  and
cognitive-behavioral  treatments.63 Of
course,  confronting  these  patients  is
very  difficult  and  the  approach  used
must be individualized for each patient.
In the study by Sarwer et al., it is worth
noting  that  participants  expressed  an
overall favorable attitude regarding cos-
metic  surgery,  with  an  association
found between such favorable attitudes
and greater psychologic stock placed in
physical appearance as well as internal-
ization  of  beauty  imagery  absorbed
from various mass media.62

MOTIVATIONS FOR SEEKING 
COSEMTIC PROCEDURES

The media often cite the disproportion-
ate number of overweight people in the
United  States,  an  epidemic  of  obesity,
which  invariably  leads  to  recitations  of
the  importance  of  exercise  and  good
health,  usually  associating  these  quali-
ties  with  youthfulness  and  beauty.  The
implication  is  that  one’s  social  accep-
tance  and  even  professional  success
hinge on these qualities.64 Clearly, body
dissatisfaction, exogenous criticism, and
the feeling that one fails to measure up
to  cultural  standards  of  appearance  and
beauty  propel  people  to  change  their
behavior, lifestyles, and appearance. In a
study  by  Santor  and  Walker,  75  people
were examined for the degree to which
their  appraisals  of  self-worth  were
linked  to  the  appraisals  of  how  inter-
ested  other  people  were  in  them.  The
investigators found a strong association
between  the  degree  to  which  people
measure certain attributes of self-worth
and  the  degree  to  which  individuals
believed  others  were  interested  in
them.65 In  other  words,  the  amount  of
interest  one  thought  others  showed
them  mediated  the  study  subjects’
expression  of  confidence  in  their  own
physical  attributes,  attractiveness,  and
sense  of  social  self-worth.  With  ideal
imagery  playing  a  greater  role  in  daily
life,  the  chances  that  individuals  will
internalize such iconography and use the
implications against themselves and oth-
ers  grows  immeasurably.  This  is  why
motivations  for  cosmetic  enhancement,
while  always  personal,  can  include
social and even professional elements.66
Studies  have  shown,  for  instance,  that
attractive children and adults are judged
and  treated  more  positively  than  unat-
tractive  children  and  adults,  even  by
those who know them, and such advan-
tages persist into every age category.18,67
As others have noted, the reasons to
undergo cosmetic procedures are always
personal,  based  on  an  individual’s  psy-
chologic  constitution,  and  inextricably
linked to body image, which is based on
a  convoluted  interplay  of  factors  both
outward and inward, objective and sub-
jective. The essential value of the proce-
dure,  though,  is  derived  from  the
patient’s  opinion  and  reaction  to  the
result and not from the general percep-
tion of the visible change as determined
by those in a patient’s life.68 Of course, a
patient’s assessment of the result may be
tempered by the reactions of her or his
family and friends. Research does show
that  enhancing  a  physical  characteristic

and  improving  physical  attractiveness
positively  affects  personality  and,  thus,
interpersonal interactions, the results of
which are internalized, exerting a posi-
tive effect on self-esteem.69

An  interesting  recent  study  of  cos-
metic  surgery  in  adolescents  is  illustra-
tive,  practically  by  definition,  of  the
social and internalized pressures regard-
ing  appearance  that  can  drive  teenagers
to  seek  cosmetic  enhancement,  as  well
as the potential psychologic and physical
boosts that such procedures can deliver.
The  responses  to  12  survey  questions
administered  to  86  of  165  adolescents
who  underwent 
surgery  between
January 2001 and June 2005 revealed no
differences
significant 
statistically 
between  males  and  females  regarding
postoperative satisfaction, with an over-
all  satisfaction  rate  of  93.83%.  Further,
postoperative  satisfaction  was  found  to
be strongly related to overall life satisfac-
tion, self-esteem, and body image.70

Youth Movement

Beauty  is  a  powerful  springboard  pro-
pelling  millions  of  people  toward  the
motivations that underlie the pursuit of
cosmetic  enhancement—the  conscious
desire,  perhaps  driven  by  potent,  sub-
conscious  genetic  impulses,  to  look
younger. From movies to music to other
forms of entertainment and advertising,
society  seems  to  increasingly  cater  to
the  young  or  youthful.  The  beauty
industry,  too,  is  youth-oriented,  only  it
aims to assist the consumer in achieving
the  universally  sought-after  youthful
appearance.  Aesthetics  and  the  search
for  youth  apply  most  directly  to  the
skin,  as  the  largest  and  most  visible
organ  of  the  body  (though,  of  course,
body shape or contour is also an impor-
tant aspect of appearance). As skin ages,
the perpetual cycle of cell turnover, which
pushes fresh, young-looking skin cells to
the stratum corneum during youth, slows
considerably. But women of all ages strive
throughout their lives to maintain the fair
skin  of  youth.  In  mimicking  nubile  ado-
lescent  beauty,  older  women  join  in  the
universal  obsession  with  clear  skin  and
the  numerous  ploys  and  attempts  to
recapture and display it.71 In that regard, it
is of course worth noting that an increas-
ing  number  of  men  are  striving  to
improve the appearance of their skin.

It  is  not  surprising,  then,  to  consider
the results of a study of 132 young adults
(with an average age of 19 years) and 142
elderly adults (with an average age of 74
years) who were enlisted to evaluate 35
different  aspects  of  their  own  bodies.

The elderly subjects expressed attitudes
that  were  less  positive  as  compared  to
those of their young counterparts regard-
ing body functioning (e.g., physical coor-
dination,  agility,  sex  drive,  and  health)
and  facial  attractiveness  (e.g., 
lips,
appearance  of  eyes,  and  cheeks/cheek-
bones).72 The  investigators  noted  that
these results hew closely to the physical
changes that take place in the body and
face through aging, which distance peo-
ple  further  from  cultural  beauty  stan-
dards. Men had more positive body atti-
tudes  than  women,  but  this  gender
difference was not nearly as pronounced
among the elderly in this study.

Although  the  elderly  have  lower
opinions  of  their  own  attractiveness
than  do  young  people,  Kligman  and
Graham  have  found  that  attractiveness
stereotypes persist into middle age and
later  years,  showing  that  the  elderly
viewed  as  attractive  have  advantages
over  the  elderly  deemed  unattractive.67
Kligman  and  Graham  suggest  that  cos-
metics can make a crucial difference for
the  elderly,  helping  them  to  receive
some  of  the  benefits  of  the  attractive
through  improvement  in  care  for  their
appearance. Makeup has long been used
as a tool to camouflage blemishes, high-
light fertility signals and, later, mask age.
With  increasing  frequency,  cosmetic
facial  procedures  have  become  another
such instrument. However, the illusions
of  youth,  and  even  fertility,  play  an
important  role  in  the  formation  of
unreasonable expectations as many cos-
metic  patients  delude  themselves  into
believing that, after a cosmetic procedure,
they  will  appear  as  they  did  20  years
ago.  This  is  one  of  the  most  important
notions that a physician must be alert to
and  prepared  to  dispel.  Whether  it  is
counteracting the effects of chronic sun
exposure,  smoking,  other  unhealthy
behavior,  or  simple  chronologic  aging,
there  is  a  limit  to  how  far  a  physician
can turn back the clock.

COMMON SKIN DISEASES 
AND THEIR PSYCHOSOCIAL 
CONSEQUENCES

The  forces  that  motivate  individuals  to
seek  cosmetic  enhancement  are  com-
pelling  enough  when  a  person 
is
healthy,  but  an  illness,  particularly  one
that disfigures in even a minor fashion,
can  wreak  havoc  with  a  person’s  self-
esteem  and  confidence  level.  Indeed,
cosmetic dermatologists and plastic sur-
geons  not  too  infrequently  encounter
patients who seek to alter their appear-

ance because of the effects of cutaneous
disorders or trauma, as well as the more
standard impetus–age. The notions that
stress can exacerbate dermatologic con-
ditions  and  that  dermatologic  disorders
can engender significant distress, partic-
ularly  when  the  face  is  involved,  may
seem to be obvious accepted dogma to
the modern practitioner. After all, given
the  status  that  appearance  has  in  our
society, it is no wonder that any disease
process  that  disfigures  or  negatively
alters  one’s  appearance  could  be  a
source  of  significant  anxiety.  The  exis-
tence  of  the  wide  variety  of  quality  of
life  indices  (e.g.,  Acne  Disability  Index,
Psoriasis Disability Index, Dermatology
Life Quality Index, Skindex, Dermatology
Quality  of  Life  Scales,  Dermatology
Specific  Quality  of  Life,  and  the
Children  Dermatology  Life  Quality
Index)73 related to dermatology is testa-
ment to the fact that clinicians are well
aware of the nexus between the appear-
ance  and  condition  of  the  skin  and  an
individual’s  psychologic  state.  Never-
theless, 
investigators  conducting  a
Medline review of the dermatologic and
psychiatric  literature,  as  well  as  other
pertinent  journals,  from  1966  to  2000
found that the psychosocial effects (e.g.,
anxiety  and  depression)  that  can  result
from  dermatologic  problems  have  the
potential to seriously impact individuals’
lives  but  that  these  effects  are  underap-
preciated.74 Indeed, it is estimated that in
at least 30% of dermatologic conditions,
psychologic  and  psychiatric  factors  play
significant  roles,  with  the  psychiatric
comorbidity  associated  with  disorders
such  as  acne  or  psoriasis  (e.g.,  suicidal
ideation  or  attempts)  serving  as  a  key
gauge to the patient’s overall disability.75

Stress and the Skin

The  most  common  skin  disorder,  acne
vulgaris,  which  afflicts  approximately
17  million  people  in  the  United  States
alone,76 is  also  a  common  source  of
emotional  stress,  self-consciousness,
and  great  personal  dissatisfaction.  A
recent review of case–control, cross-sec-
tional  population  surveys,  and  cohort
studies  of  acne  patients  has  buttressed
previous observational or anecdotal evi-
dence  that  acne  provokes  significant
psychosocial morbidity and psychologic
distress.77 A more recent cross-sectional
study  screening  for  BDD  symptoms
using  a  validated  self-report  question-
naire and single-observer assessment of
acne severity among acne patients offers
additional  support.  This  study  revealed
that a significant proportion of patients

(ranging from 14.1% to 21.1% depend-
ing on the stringency of the criteria used
to evaluate acne) exhibited notable pre-
occupation  and  anxiety  regarding  their
facial  appearance.78 Of  course,  distress
in response to a cutaneous condition can
be  associated  with  the  wide  range  of
dermatologic  disorders  that  can  affect
the  face,  including  rosacea,  melasma,
vitiligo, and others.

While stress may result as a reaction to
the  emergence  of  a  skin  disorder,  stress
can  also  precipitate  or  contribute  to  the
etiologic  pathway  of  a  cutaneous  mani-
festation.  Elias  has  shown  that  the  cuta-
neous homeostatic permeability barrier as
well  as  the  protective  action  of  the  stra-
tum  corneum  is  disrupted  by  stress.79
Studies have also demonstrated that glu-
cocorticoids,  which  are  generated  in
response to stress, inhibit lipid production
thereby reducing the synthesis and secre-
tion of lamellar bodies, thus contributing
to  disruption  of  the  skin  barrier.80,81
Indeed,  psychologic  stress  appears  to
aggravate, or even initiate, various derma-
tologic  disorders  including  psoriasis  and
atopic dermatitis82 (see Chapter 11).

Although  the  nature  of  the  associa-
tion  between  stress  and  the  exacerba-
tion  of  certain  skin  conditions  has  not
been  fully  elucidated,  two  traditional
explanations have been offered. That is,
the  activation  of  two  stress  axes,  the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)
axis, which elevates cortisol levels, and
the  sympathetic  nervous  system  axis,
which  increases  adrenaline  levels,  are
thought  to  alter  immune  balance  and
inflammation.83
facilitate  cutaneous 
Recently,  a  third  stress  axis  has  been
suggested.  Specifically,  Pavlovic  et  al.
have demonstrated that peripheral neu-
ropeptidergic  nerve  fibers  transmit
stress  to  the  skin,  exacerbating  cuta-
neous  inflammation.  The  investigators
showed  that  the  number  of  cutaneous
nerve  fibers  containing  the  stress  neu-
ropeptide substance P was increased sig-
nificantly  by  sound  stress  and  atopic
dermatitis-like  allergic  dermatitis  in
mice. They concluded that AD is aggra-
vated  by  stress  by  dint  of  substance 
P-dependent  cutaneous  neurogenic  in-
flammation  and  ensuing  local  cytokine
movement, warranting consideration as
a therapeutic target.84

Just  as  the  identification  of  a  third
stress  axis  suggests  the  potential  for
novel therapeutic approaches to mitigat-
ing  the  effects  of  stress  on  certain  skin
conditions,  additional  recent  research
appears  to  suggest  the  potential  for
eventual  clinical  impact.  Aberg  et  al.
have shown that the severity of group A

Streptococcus  pyogenes skin  infection  in
mice  was  augmented  by  psychologic
stress, which led to elevated synthesis of
endogenous  glucocorticoids.  In  particu-
lar, they found that increased glucocorti-
coid production reduced epidermal lipid
synthesis  and  lamellar  body  secretion,
specifically lowering the level of expres-
sion  of  two  pivotal  antimicrobial  pep-
tides and their delivery into the lamellar
bodies.85 In an article in the same issue of
The  Journal  of  Clinical  Investigation in
which the findings of Aberg et al. were
published, Slominski, a specialist in der-
matopathology and neuroendocrinology
of the skin, commented on the work of
Aberg  and  colleagues,  suggesting  the
potential  for  clinical  impact  in  various
forms,  including  systemic  and  topical
selective  receptor  antagonists  for  HPA
axis peptide and steroid messengers, top-
ical agents that promote cortisol metabo-
lism  inactivation,  and  the  development
of  agents  that  inhibit  steroidogenesis
(thereby  enhancing  cutaneous  antimi-
crobial and barrier protection activity).86
As discussed previously, stress can also
be an influential factor in pigmentary dis-
orders  (see  Chapter  13).  Melanocyte-
stimulating  hormone  (MSH)  levels  have
been shown to be influenced by a rise in
adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH)
levels,  which 
increase  with  stress.
Through this pathway, MSH may play a
role  in  aggravating  melasma  and  other
dyspigmentations in stressed patients.87

The Skin and the Mind

intimate,  complex 

The 
relationship
between  the  status  of  one’s  appearance
and  the  emotional  reaction  to  it,  or  the
relationship  between  the  skin  and  the
mind,  is  clearly  important  to  assess  in
screening patients before cosmetic proce-
dures.  Indeed,  Jafferany,  the  author  of  a
review  of  the  dermatologic  and  psychi-
atric  literature  in  Medline  from  1951  to
2004,  concluded  that  consideration  of
related psychosocial factors is an integral
part of effectively managing the cutaneous
conditions  of  most  patients  who  present
to dermatologists.88 Further, the identifica-
tion of psychiatric or psychosocial comor-
bidity  would  likely  contraindicate  cos-
metic  treatment  until  the  satisfactory
resolution  of  the  symptoms,  perhaps
through cooperative efforts of dermatolo-
gists and psychiatrists (of course, psychi-
atric  conditions  may  also  lead  to  some
dermatologic  problems,  but  such  scenar-
ios are beyond the scope of this chapter).
The  potential  motivations  that  lead  a
patient to seek cosmetic enhancement, as
understood through the filter of the psy-

chosocial framework that informs our per-
ceptions  and  feelings  about  appearance,
are important to consider, even passively,
as one screens patients to determine their
suitability for cosmetic treatment.

SUMMARY

For better of for worse, appearance mat-
ters  in  our  society.  It  matters  to  the
observer and the observed. That is, peo-
ple  are  concerned  about  their  own
appearance  and  that  of  others,  particu-
larly  the  appearance  of  a  prospective
mate.  Interest  in  appearance  matters
enough  to  form  the  foundation  of  the
multibillion-dollar  beauty  industry  and
its  concomitant  but  lucrative  advertis-
ing. Appearance also matters enough to
propel  millions  of  people  each  year  to
seek  cosmetic  enhancement  at  the
hands of dermatologists and plastic sur-
geons  as  well  as  other  body  alterations
from  nonmedical  specialists.  But  it  is
important  to  realize  that  appearance  is
hardly  all  that  matters.  For  those  who
are not visually impaired, appearance is
central  in  the  first  impression  made  to
the world. What matters more, though,
is the content of character, as well as the
life  choices  and  actions  one  pursues.
Appearance  is  clearly  a  component  in
self-esteem, but it is just as clearly a rel-
ative component, it matters much more
to some than others. Indeed, for many,
though,  beauty 
is  a  controversial,
inflammatory subject.

Cosmetic  dermatologists  and  plastic
surgeons  can  play  a  unique  role  in
patients’ lives by performing procedures
that impart a more youthful appearance,
and by educating these patients on tech-
niques to prevent aging, thereby provid-
ing an additional avenue for patients to
improve self-esteem. In addition, practi-
tioners have a unique opportunity to be
involved in pivotal changes in a patient’s
psyche. Making patients feel good about
themselves is certainly one of the perks
of  being  a  cosmetic  dermatologist  or
plastic surgeon.

There  is  an  apparently  inexhaustible,
cross-cultural  search  for  and  obsession
with “beauty.” The concept of beauty has
evolved,  perhaps,  throughout  the  cen-
turies as attempts to define, understand, or
capture  it  have  persisted.  Indeed,  the
search  for  beauty  appears  universal  and
timeless. As such, when the notion is asso-
ciated with enhancing or making modifi-
cations  to  one’s  natural  endowment  (to
become  more  “beautiful”),  and  it  seems
there is a steady supply of people who will
seek to do so, such a procedure is best left
in  the  hands  of  professionals  who  are

expert in the physiology and health of the
areas to be altered. Essentially, it is better
that  cosmetic  dermatologists  and  plastic
surgeons meet the steady demand and, in
so  doing,  apply  medical  knowledge  and
expertise  toward  the  redevelopment  and
enhancement of the psyche as well as the
skin.  Perhaps  it  is  true  that  “no  one  can
make you feel inferior without your con-
sent”;  but  it  may  be  equally  true  that
patients are giving consent to their physi-
cians  to  make  them  feel  superior—supe-
rior  to  their  recent  selves  or  simply  on  a
par  with  their  earlier  selves.  Physicians
should handle this power responsibly and
wisely.  Practitioners  must  recognize  that
there are countless influences on the aes-
thetic judgments of individuals and strive
to  educate  patients  to  make  the  proper
choices that will enhance their self-esteem
and ameliorate their quality of life, with-
out causing harm.
